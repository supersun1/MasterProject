Left-wing media journalist says 75% of media writers have “side job destroying Trump ballots”,"(Natural News) Jon Schwarz, a prominent left-wing writer for The Intercept, thinks that destroying the ballots of people who vote for Donald Trump is the moral solution to preventing a second Trump term.
According to Schwarz, who also writes for The New York Times, The Atlantic and other far-left media outlets, “at least” 75 percent of those who work in the mainstream media – “including me,” he tweeted – have “a side job destroying Trump ballots.”
“When you love something as much as we love destroying Trump ballots, you make the time,” he tweeted back on Nov. 1, 2016.
Schwarz added in a series of other tweets the same day that destroying Trump ballots is “not a felony.” He also added that “the constitution says you can destroy trump ballots,” presumably joking – but how does one really tell anymore?
In a recent article he wrote entitled, “The Election Isn’t Over Until Trump’s Gone,” Schwarz suggested that people who hate Trump need to initiate “street fights” in the event that Trump wins reelection on Nov. 3.
Schwarz also believes that illegal aliens should not only be allowed to vote, but to do so multiple times until Democrat candidates are able to “win.”
A self-described alum of filmmaker Michael Moore’s Dog Eat Dog films, as well as “a research producer for Moore’s Capitalism: A Love Story,” Schwarz is hellbent on removing Trump from office through any means possible.
After being accused of visiting a voting site during the 2016 election “to fake IDs & assist in ferrying illegals from polling station to polling station,” Schwarz responded unashamedly with:
“let’s not rest on our laurels though, everyone’s needed in Wisconsin to destroy Trump ballots during the recount.”

Schwarz supports militant Antifa-backed Transition Integrity Project
Should Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not win in a landslide on Nov. 3, Schwarz’s allies over at the Transition Integrity Project (TIP) are planning to unleash hell across America.
The so-called “Fight Back Table” has indicated plans to initiate “mass public unrest” in the event that Trump wins, and Schwarz wants to take it all a step further with mass violence.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly taken notice of Schwarz’s statements and behavior, having launched an investigation into a positive reaction that Schwarz had to a tweet by Huffington Post editor Nick Baumann that reads:
“i love my job working at a voting site in washington dc destroying trump ballots.”
After Baumann came out to state that he was joking, Schwarz chimed in and stated that he:
“want[ed] to emphasize to the FBI that, while @nickbaumann was joking, I was completely serious. I am not kidding.”
Schwarz further bragged that he has supposedly “destroy[ed] 1000s of ballots,” further expressing confusion that the FBI “is investigating Nick for jokes when I’m the one who destroyed 1000s of ballots.”
Since “lots more people want [Trump] to be president” than Biden or anyone else – Schwarz’s words, not ours – Schwarz has made it his personal mission to “destroy the ballots” to try to keep Trump out of office.
Schwarz now claims that all of these tweets were mere jokes, despite the incredible volume of them that would suggest otherwise. He apparently thinks he is quite the funny guy who compensates for his lack of wit by suggesting that he commits election fraud for fun.
“Still waiting on your piece debunking police shooting stats,” wrote one Twitter user trying to get Schwarz’s attention concerning a promise he apparently made in an earlier article about police violence.
“It never materialize[d]. I guess you’re busy with other stuff.”

State Department is preventing Biden from accessing messages from foreign leaders,"Washington (CNN)A stack of messages from foreign leaders to President-elect Joe Biden are sitting at the State Department but the Trump administration is preventing him from accessing them, according to State Department officials familiar with the messages.
Traditionally, the State Department supports all communications for the President-elect, which is why many countries began sending messages to State over the weekend. But with Biden prohibited from accessing State Department resources by the Trump administration, because President Donald Trump refuses to accept Biden's victory, dozens of incoming messages have not been received.
Biden's team is contacting foreign governments on their own and he has held numerous calls with leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel and Canada's Justin Trudeau. But they are operating without the logistical and translation support that the State Department operations center provides.
""They would prefer to be using the State Department resources,"" said a source familiar with the situation, who noted that the Biden team is having to deal with the unexpected challenge of facilitating these calls.
Not only is Biden being blocked by the State Department from receiving messages and assistance facilitating and from preparing for calls, on Tuesday Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to acknowledge Biden's victory, saying that ""there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" igniting a furor and roiling diplomats.
Biden is also being blocked from getting the same intelligence briefings as the President, known as the President's Daily Brief, and should the Trump administration continue to block a typical transition close to Inauguration Day on January 20, there are concerns Biden's administration will be playing catch-up the day he takes office.
Foreign leaders have begun to figure out that State cannot get them in touch with the President-elect and their teams have reached out to former Obama-era diplomats for their assistance on how to send congratulatory messages to Biden's team, sources told CNN. Some foreign governments feel they are navigating an unfamiliar maze, foreign diplomats have told CNN.
""It was helpful to have State ops place the calls and to provide translation services, and we were grateful for the cooperation from the Bush administration for making that happen,"" said Denis McDonough, who served in the Obama administration and worked with Obama during the transition.
The calls taking place right now are not highly sensitive, and even during a well-oiled transition period they are not normally conducted on secure lines, multiple sources explained.
""These calls in the past have been handled on open lines. They are congratulatory calls,"" McDonough said, adding that both sides are providing readouts, which is consistent with protocol.
Barack Obama often made these calls to foreign leaders on his cell phone when he was President-elect, explained a State Department official who worked on setting up those calls at the time. But they all went through the operations center, which meant there is a government record of the calls he made.
Career officials at the State Department are ready to help the Biden team when the time comes.
""The agencies implemented the law faithfully prior to the election. The materials are ready, the offices are ready, everything is ready; they are waiting for the green light,"" said David Marchick, the director of the Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service.
Operating without State Department support right now, the Biden team -- made up of many experienced former government officials -- has sent out readouts of all of the calls, which help with record keeping. They are making an effort to formalize the process and will use State Department resources when they are available, said a source familiar with the unfolding situation.
This is a stark contrast with the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. At the time, President-elect Trump opted not to use State Department resources. Instead, he made his calls out of Trump Tower and resisted using the government support and coordination system, which meant that translators and staff sat waiting without any work while Trump made calls on his own, a State Department official told CNN at the time.
At any other point since Biden left the White House, he would have been able to call into the State Department operations center to place a call to a foreign leader, State Department officials told CNN. Former presidents and vice presidents are allowed to use the resource whenever they wish. But now, as he is President-elect, Biden is being prevented from using that facility by the Trump administration.

"White House political director tests positive for coronavirus, official says","(CNN)White House political affairs director Brian Jack has tested positive for coronavirus, an official confirmed to CNN on Wednesday.
The White House declined to comment on Jack specifically, but said in a statement that positive cases are ""taken seriously.""
""Contact tracing has been conducted by the White House Medical Unit consistent with CDC guidelines to stop further transmission. Appropriate notifications and recommendations have been made,"" the statement said.
Jack attended the election night party held indoors over a week ago. The news was first reported by The New York Times.
This story is breaking and will be updated.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/brian-jack-coronavirus-white-house/index.html,Kaitlan Collins,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 19:33:25 GMT",CNN,1,
White House coronavirus task force warns of 'accelerating community spread',"(CNN)The White House coronavirus task force is again alerting states of ""accelerating"" coronavirus spread as cases and hospitalizations rapidly rise across the country with few signs of stabilizing. It strongly recommends increased testing in its weekly reports to states.
""There is continued, accelerating community spread across the top half of the country, where temperatures have cooled and Americans have moved indoors,"" reports dated November 8 and distributed to states Tuesday evening said.
The task force, which warned of ""significant deterioration in the Sunbelt"" in last week's set of reports, said that that deterioration has only continued in the past week, ""leading to the most diffuse spread experienced to date.""
The weekly task force reports continue to provide an unvarnished, unfiltered look at the reality of each state's current situation, which comes as President Donald Trump and task force leader Vice President Mike Pence have declined to address the worsening pandemic publicly in weeks. The White House has repeatedly declined to make all of the reports publicly accessible.
In recommendations to several states, the task force called for an expansion of testing, particularly to target asymptomatic cases.
""The silent community spread that precedes and continues throughout surges can only be identified and interrupted through proactive and increased testing and surveillance,"" reports for multiple states said, suggesting expanding point-of-care antigen tests.
The reports said: ""Proactive testing must be part of the mitigation efforts, inclusive of mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and immediate isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine.""
A report for New Mexico, where the task force said there is ""full and unrelenting community spread,"" noted that requiring testing only for individuals experiencing Covid-19 symptoms ""is preventing adequate testing and control of the pandemic.""
North Dakota remains the state with the highest number of new cases per 100,000 population, followed by South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana, Illinois, Utah and Minnesota in the top 10.
Vermont remains the state with the lowest number of cases and is one of only two states, including Hawaii, in the task force-defined ""yellow zone"" for new cases, meaning between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 population. But Vermont was still warned in its report that there is ""cause for concern given the continued uptick in the state"" coinciding with colder weather.
The report for Ohio described ""vast and unmitigated community spread"" with ""no evidence of improvement.""
In Delaware, where cases are disproportionately affecting young adults between 20 and 35 years of age, the task force said, ""We share the assessment of Delaware leaders that the Covid epidemic is likely to worsen.""
Some state reports reiterated the need for communication of ""basic actions"" residents should take.
""Do not gather without a mask with individuals living outside of your household,"" ""Always wear a mask in public places,"" ""Stop gatherings beyond immediate household until cases and test positivity are in the yellow zone"" and ""Get your flu shot,"" the reports warned.
And, as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, one state's report stressed the need for indoor mask usage.
""We need to protect those we are thankful for in our families and communities. Ensure indoor masking around vulnerable family members during any gatherings due to the significant amount of virus circulating and the high rate of asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections among family and community members,"" the report said.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/coronavirus-task-force-state-reports/index.html,Betsy Klein,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:22:00 GMT",CNN,1,
Alarm grows over Trump's 'dictator moves' as he denies election defeat,"(CNN)President Donald Trump's administration is taking on the characteristics of a tottering regime -- with its loyalty tests, destabilizing attacks on the military chain of command, a deepening bunker mentality and increasingly delusional claims of political victory.
In response, a visibly confident President-elect Joe Biden is going out of his way to project calm amid the deepening chaos, even as Trump and senior Republicans still refuse to acknowledge the President's defeat in a stunning break with America's democratic traditions.
Biden is taking calls with leaders of the country's top allies, which reflects the inevitability of his ascent to power. While the President is staying behind closed doors, tweeting in wild block capital letters and unleashing a purge of the Pentagon's civilian leadership, Biden is on camera. The President-elect is reassuring the American people with a composure granted by an election win that Trump's threadbare legal cases baselessly alleging massive voter fraud have little chance of overturning the will of the voters.
The President-elect on Tuesday consciously avoided escalating a confrontation with Trump, who is withholding the access and funding that incoming presidents normally rely on to stand up their administrations. But while Trump will remain President until January 20, an unmistakable symbolic transfer of authority is taking place despite Trump's efforts to deny his successor legitimacy.
""We don't see anything that's slowing us down, quite frankly,"" Biden said.
The President-elect has already crossed the necessary threshold of 270 electoral votes, according to projections from CNN and other major news outlets and has a chance of matching Trump's 2016 total of 306 electoral votes given his leads in Georgia and Arizona.
And more false accusations and conspiracy theories touted by Trump supporters to claim electoral fraud are dissolving, a day after Attorney General William Barr stepped into the political fray to advise prosecutors to probe major fraud.
The Department of Homeland Security meanwhile pushed back on rumors that ballots were cast on behalf of dead people.
But the Trump team only dug itself deeper into a bizarre parallel universe -- one where the President has already secured a second term -- consistent with the embrace of misinformation and alternative facts that has characterized the last four years.
The administration's defiance took an even more ridiculous twist on Tuesday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo showed his loyalty to a leader who shows no sign of working on key issues -- including a pandemic that has now landed more Americans in hospitals than ever before.
""There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" Pompeo said. Asked whether Trump's refusal to concede undercut traditional US critiques of corrupt elections abroad, Pompeo rounded on a reporter: ""That's ridiculous. And you know it's ridiculous, and you asked it because it's ridiculous."" As recently as Monday, Pompeo issued a statement warning of electoral issues in Myanmar, which was long ruled by the military and has endured a difficult transition to semi-democracy where dissidents once looked at the US as a lodestar.
In Wilmington, Delaware, the President-elect pointedly refused to pour fuel on the fire, dismissing the idea that he needed to take legal action to release transition funds and making clear that he was confident that the process of assuming power would eventually work itself out.
He described Trump's behavior since Election Day as ""an embarrassment"" and after saying he was seeking to be tactful added: ""It will not help the President's legacy."" Asked whether Republicans would ever accept his victory, he said, ""They will, they will,"" and he suggested with a half-smile that GOP senators were ""mildly intimidated"" by the President.
Biden, who once had a reputation as a windy public speaker, is showing a new persona to the American people. He noticeably chose his words carefully on Tuesday, putting on a show of calm, as he experiences the transformation that often comes over victorious candidates as they begin to assume the weight of the presidency after winning elections.
Trump by contrast is tarnishing the instruments of American democracy by refusing to concede and leaving the country more vulnerable with revenge firings that threaten to weaken critical national security agencies.
After Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had put loyalty to the Constitution ahead of his duty to the President, three other senior Pentagon officials have been fired or resigned. They include the department's top policy official, James Anderson, who resigned and is being replaced by retired Brigadier General Anthony Tata, whose nomination for the post earlier this summer foundered after CNN's KFile reported his numerous past Islamophobic and offensive remarks.
Sources told Barbara Starr and CNN's Pentagon team that the dismissals might be motivated by pushback from Esper and his team against a withdrawal from Afghanistan that would be carried out before the required conditions on the ground were met, and other pending security issues.
""This is scary, it's very unsettling,"" one defense official told CNN. ""These are dictator moves.""
A disputed transfer of power could offer US adversaries an opening, especially if there is a belief abroad that there is disarray in the national security infrastructure. Trump may next turn his ire on CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Christopher Wray, CNN's Jake Tapper has reported. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on CNN International Tuesday that he feared the US was entering a dangerous period.
""I think (Trump) is going to be uniquely distracted from world events and national security,"" Murphy said. Former national security adviser John Bolton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Pompeo's comments on a Trump transition were ""delusional.""
""I think he has eviscerated his credibility internationally because I think there are very few people even in the US government who believe that is the case,"" Bolton said.
Despite Trump's claims that his second term is being stolen from him, the President's legal claim has so far made no headway in its efforts to claim massive fraud. The gambit looks increasingly like a political exercise as Trump struggles to come to terms with his defeat while Republican senators scared of the President's political base refuse to cross him, especially with two Georgia run-off elections scheduled for January that will decide control of their chamber.
Trump's already minuscule opportunity to change the course of the election is diminishing by the day. Biden is now more than 46,000 votes ahead in Pennsylvania, is up by 12,000 in Georgia and has a lead of 14,000 ballots in Arizona. It is not clear whether there are sufficient remaining votes left in the Grand Canyon state for the President to overtake the President-elect.
As the Trump campaign filed a new long-shot lawsuit in Michigan, which Biden won by nearly than 150,000 votes, its communications director Tim Murtaugh said, ""We do believe that ultimately President Trump will be declared the winner of this election.""
But Benjamin Ginsberg, a veteran Republican election lawyer, said that the Trump campaign ""was a long way from nowhere"" in its quest to overturn the outcome of the election.
""To win cases, they have to put enough results into play to change the outcome of the election in individual states and in none of the suits they have filed around the country are they anywhere close to doing that in any state,"" Ginsberg said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""
Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dug in Tuesday on his insistence that Trump was within his rights to pursue his complaints.
""I think we ought to quit all the hand-wringing and not act like this is extraordinary,"" the newly reelected Kentucky Republican said.
""We're going to get through this period and we'll swear in the winner on January the 20th, 2021, just like we have every four years since 1793.""
While many observers believe McConnell is playing a long political game — with the Georgia run-offs and the 2022 midterm congressional elections in mind, the silence of Republican senators is emboldening Trump's intransigence.
The world has already moved on
But while GOP lawmakers aren't willing to break with the President, many world leaders are moving to embrace Biden -- including a number of whom who saw themselves as ideological counterparts of the President.
Biden's campaign released statements on the President-elect's calls with the leaders of France, Germany and Ireland. Biden also spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose populist leanings made him a good fit with Trump. Johnson promised to work with Biden in a post-Covid-19 era.
Even Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who bonded with Trump over their common strongman tendencies, issued a public message congratulating Biden on his ""election success."" And Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- who has a close and controversial relationship with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner -- sent Biden a cable in which they conveyed congratulations on ""His Excellency's victory in the presidential elections.""
Biden said he had a simple message for all the world leaders: ""I am letting them know America is back.""

Republican senator says he will step in if Biden doesn't have access to intelligence briefings by Friday,"(CNN)Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford said Wednesday that he will intervene if the Trump administration has not allowed President-elect Joe Biden access to presidential daily intelligence briefings by the end of the week, one of the first rights of a presidential candidate after winning the election.
""There is no loss from him getting the briefings and to be able to do that,"" Lankford told radio station KRMG, noting that he sits on the Senate Oversight Committee and that he's already started engaging on this issue.
The Oklahoma Republican said if no progress is made on the issue by Friday, he will step in and say, ""This needs to occur so that regardless of the outcome of the election, whichever way that it goes, people can be ready for that actual task.""
Lankford's comment comes as Biden and his senior advisers are not yet receiving the President's Daily Brief, the highly classified intelligence briefings about pressing national security issues that their soon-to-be predecessor has been offered daily.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Monday that Biden's lack of access stems from the election being not yet ascertained by the General Services Administration -- a clear indication that the Biden transition team is not getting the same briefings that presidents-elect typically receive.
It remains unclear whether the race needs to be ascertained before the President-elect can legally receive the briefings. Biden has said that the daily briefings ""would be useful, but it's not necessary.""
Lankford on Wednesday also referenced the abbreviated 2000 transition, which a bipartisan 9/11 report said contributed to a lack of security preparedness ahead of the 9/11 terror attacks.
""There's nothing wrong with Vice President Biden getting the briefings to be able to prepare himself and so that he can be ready -- the President's already getting those,"" Lankford said, adding that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a Democratic senator from California, also has the appropriate clearances to begin receiving briefings because she serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, also called for Biden to receive the briefings.
""As has been done in every other transition, the President should order that Biden and his team receive the PDB, as has been done in the past, even during the contested election of 2000,"" Warner said Wednesday. ""It's simply irresponsible to withhold this in these uncertain times.""
Like most of his Republican colleagues, Lankford did not go so far as to acknowledge that Biden is the president-elect after every major news organization projected his victory on Saturday.
Lankford defended the President's many legal disputes, saying the best thing right now is for Trump to be able to go through the legal process and ""get real answers"" before the Electoral College casts ballots in December.
There is no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in this election.
In the meantime, Lankford said, ""Joe Biden can continue to be able to function and say, 'I'm the president-elect,' and great if you want to say that, go do it, and to be able to do your preparation work. The President can say, 'Not so fast. I've got questions to answer.' Great, go ask them.""
Lankford implied that if the President is not able to follow through with its legal proceedings, it might stoke conspiracies among Trump supporters.
But judges have quickly dismissed cases that attempt to raise the possibility of voting irregularities, while elections experts make clear Biden's margin of victory is too wide for court cases to reverse and that existing court cases deal with too few votes, if any, to matter.
Asked about concerns at the Pentagon after Defense Secretary Mark Esper's firing on Monday and other moves by the administration that put a peaceful transfer of power into question, Lankford replied, ""I can assure you, there will be a peaceful transition of power in the United States.""
Lankford downplayed the significance of Esper's firing within days of the election, saying it was ""obviously long-planned"" and not just from a ""single petty event from months ago.""
He said, though, that he personally would not have made that change ""with the next two months"" -- seeming to refer to the two-month period until the inauguration -- again without fully acknowledging Biden as President-elect.
""It was a clear signal with preparation behind the scenes for a good transition at the Pentagon,"" Lankford said.

"Democrats create “Donald Trump Watch” website containing home addresses of Trump donors for Antifa, BLM to target","(Natural News) Left-wingers are once again showing their unique brand of love and tolerance for the opposition by launching a new website that doxes everyone in the country who contributed money to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, sharing their home addresses online.
Known as “Donald Trump Watch,” the site features an unsightly image of Trump grimacing alongside the words, “Americans that Give Money to Support a Racist.” Below it, users can search by zip code or street address to see who near them has ever donated money to Trump.
After plugging in an address or zip code, users are presented with a clickable map full of pins and addresses of Trump supporters in the area who supported a “racist” with their cash donations.
The top of the site features a quote from Voltaire that insinuates Trump is a dictator akin to Adolph Hitler:
“Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.”
Since the Donald Trump Watch site draws from publicly available information compiled by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), it is not technically illegal (as far as we know). However, it does tee-up Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Antifa to easily target Trump supporters for organized “protests.”
Why are the communist Chinese encouraging BLM, Antifa to commit violence against Trump supporters?
While claiming to be a privately owned entity not connected to any government agency, a little digging reveals that Donald Trump Watch is actually run by a company tied to the communist Chinese regime.
Dynadot LLC, the registered company associated with the site, is based out of San Mateo, Calif., but also has two offices in China – one in Zhenzhou and another in Beijing. Dynadot also apparently has an office in Toronto.
“Dynadot is a privately held ICANN accredited domain name registrar and web hosting company founded by software engineer Todd Han in 2002,” claims Wikipedia.
“Dynadot’s headquarters is established in San Mateo, California, with offices in Zhengzhou and Beijing, China, as well as Toronto, Canada.”
The group behind Dynadot is called Public Service Media Group, Inc., a corporation based out of Delaware where Joe Biden is from. It has three one-star reviews on Spokeo, one of which reads as follows:
“This company … is terrible, real scum lowlifes! They have a website where they publish all President Trump supporters / donors. So it makes it easier to be harassed by the terrorist group known as Antifa, which how they are still walking around beating up helpless people is beyond me!”
Another reviewer claims to be in pursuit of the owner of Public Service Media Group in order to file a lawsuit.
“He / she is responsible for a website called ‘Racism Watch’ that publishes names and addresses of individuals who make monetary donations to the Donald J. Trump campaign,” along with an email where information can be sent.
As far as we can tell, none of the major social media platforms have censored their users from sharing the link to Donald Trump Watch, despite the fact that it encourages people who hate Trump to harass and even harm his supporters and donors.
NBC News‘ Brandy Zadrozny would be proud, seeing as how she gets paid by her employer to do much the same, digging up information about Trump supporters in order to put them in the crosshairs of Antifa and BLM.
“The list isn’t going to tell anyone anything that the giant Trump flag outside my house isn’t already telling them,” wrote one commenter at The Gateway Pundit.
“But this is called terrorism, doxing people is a threat against people and their families in order to intimidate them into changing their behavior so that the terrorists can achieve a political objective. Antifa and all their allies need to be charged as terrorists.”

The non-stop effort to take down Trump and America,"(Natural News) On November 17, 2016, a meeting that may turn out to have been one of the most pivotal in American history took place at Trump Tower in New York City. On that day, nine days after the tumultuous 2016 presidential election, Admiral Michael S. Rogers met secretly with President-elect Donald Trump. It was a meeting that set off Deep State alarms, and those alarm bells instantly started echoing throughout the controlled Deep State media empire.
(Article by William F. Jasper republished from TheNewAmerican.com)
Why the intense anxiety? As director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Admiral Rogers was then also chief of the Central Security Service (CSS) and commander of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). He had previously served as the director for intelligence for both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. Pacific Command, as well as commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet and commander of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command. In other words, he was the top dog in the world of signals intelligence (SIGINT) and held the keys to the kingdom of America’s powerful surveillance-state apparatus.
What was Admiral Rogers doing at Trump Tower? According to globalist Deep State media assets, such as the Washington Post, NPR, and the New York Times, he was ingratiating himself to Donald Trump, hoping to get a job in the new administration as director of national intelligence (DNI), a position then held by Obama appointee James Clapper. The admiral’s detractors claim that he was about to be fired by President Obama for NSA intelligence failures and for his “aloof” leadership style. But according to Rogers’ defenders, the admiral’s journey to New York was a daring mission to warn the incoming president about a treasonous coup plot involving top members of the Obama administration and key leaders in the other intelligence agencies. And the media efforts to denigrate Rogers’ reputation were aimed precisely at publicly undermining his credibility and the warning he was delivering.
The extraordinary events of the past four years support the position of Admiral Rogers’ advocates, not his attackers. We all have witnessed, in real time, an unprecedented and ongoing coup effort in which high-level officials within the Trump administration, together with members of Congress, former government officials, media organizations, major think tanks, tax-exempt foundations, labor unions, and militant street mobs have carried out a coordinated and relentless campaign of disruption, subversion, insurrection, sabotage, and “resistance” to cripple and topple President Donald J. Trump. During that time, a continuous stream of revelations — through leaks, whistleblowers, inspector general reports, court rulings, congressional investigations, and Department of Justice investigations — has provided crucial witness testimony and documentary evidence to connect many of the dots.
Some of these crucial disclosures have only come to light in the final weeks leading up to the November 2020 elections. It has taken that long — the entire (first) term of the Trump presidency — to pry loose the damning evidence of criminality and treachery behind, for instance, the infamous (and phony) “Steele dossier”; the illegal FISA court warrants obtained for Spygate; the sham “Trump-Russia collusion” charge; the vicious FBI/DOJ/Mueller railroading of General Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Roger Stone, and Paul Manafort; the real evidence of Hillary Clinton-Russia collusion; the FBI/DOJ/Mueller collusion with Hillary Clinton, Fusion GPS, and Crowdstrike — and much, much more.
The Empire Strikes Back
The Trump Tower rendezvous between the president-elect and the NSA chief, understandably, caused a panic attack among the Deep State coup plotters. Although the actual content of the conversation between Trump and Rogers has not been publicly revealed, all indications are that the admiral spilled some pretty big beans. On the same day of that meeting, having apparently been apprised by Rogers that they were being spied upon, the Trump Transition Team surprised everyone with the abrupt announcement that they were immediately moving all transition activity to Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump then had a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, constructed at Trump Tower to prevent hostile surveillance — from enemies both foreign and domestic. On November 19, 2016, two days after that historic Trump-Rogers meeting, the attacks on Admiral Rogers began. Naturally, the Deep State conspirators chose the Washington Post, their longtime favorite disinformation spigot, to lead the smear campaign. The Post article, entitled “Pentagon and intelligence community chiefs have urged Obama to remove the head of the NSA,” stated, “The heads of the Pentagon and the nation’s intelligence community have recommended to President Obama that the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, be removed.”
“The recommendation, delivered to the White House last month,” the story continued, “was made by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to several U.S. officials familiar with the matter.” Typical of media hatchet jobs, the article was replete with alleged negative statements and allegations by anonymous “senior officials.”
Although it is dangerous to believe anything carried in that lie factory, it turns out the Post was correct in stating that top Department of Defense and intelligence community officials were urging President Obama to fire Admiral Rogers even before his trip to Trump Tower. Why? Well, as we subsequently learned, Rogers had been throwing sand into the gears of the coup plotters for the past year, challenging and thwarting their illegal activities. It appears that for months prior to the Trump Tower meeting, Rogers had been playing a cat-and-mouse game with the Obama administration and its lackeys in the “Intelligence Community.” Defense Secretary Ashton “Ash” Carter, who is also a director of the globalist-minded Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, took the lead in calling for his ouster. However, apparently it was Department of Justice National Security Division (DOJ-NSD) head John P. Carlin who had been assigned the job of deep-sixing the troublesome admiral.
Jeff Carlson, who writes for the Epoch Times and has posted some of the most detailed and perceptive articles on the coup intrigue, wrote that “Carlin was setting up Rogers as the scapegoat” for the very crimes Rogers was trying to stop and expose. Rogers had gone to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to report violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the Obama administration and members of the intelligence community. Section 702 of FISA is aimed at protecting Americans against warrantless search and seizure. Under Section 702, the NSA “may not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States.” Among additional prohibitions, it “may not intentionally target a U.S. person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.”
Carlin was the official at DOJ responsible for ensuring that the administration abided by FISA restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. However, he had covered for the Obama administration’s routine violation of those restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. Admiral Rogers became aware of the serious nature and extent of FISA violations and ordered the NSA’s Office of Compliance to “do a fundamental baseline review of compliance associated with 702.” Among the findings of the review was that the FBI, which had access to NSA intercepts, was illegally sharing this FISA data on individuals with private contractors. This criminal use of private contractors was one of a number of violations condemned by FISC presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer in her stinging rebuke of the FBI in her April 26, 2017 ruling. This FBI abuse apparently had been brought to her attention by Admiral Rogers, who had already shut down all FBI contractor access a year before, in April 2016. Although Judge Collyer’s ruling redacts the names of the contractors, various analysts have reasonably suggested from clues in the text, timelines, and related data that at least some of the contractors cited are very likely entities associated with Hillary Clinton’s campaign, such as Fusion GPS and Crowdstrike.
Additionally, the NSA compliance review found numerous “About Query” violations. “Rogers shut down all ‘about query’ activity on Oct. 21, 2016,” reported Jeff Carlson in the Epoch Times on December 20, 2019. “‘About queries’ are particularly worrisome,” Carlson noted, “since they occur when the target is neither the sender nor the recipient of the collected communication; rather, the target’s ‘query,’ such as an email address, is being passed between two other communicants.”
Admiral Rogers and the FISA court also dinged the FBI and DOJ for failure to comply with Standard Minimization Procedures. The website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) describes “minimization” as “a detailed set of procedures designed to minimize the acquisition, retention, use and dissemination of U.S. person information acquired under Section 702.”
Subsequent revelations highlighted another egregious intelligence abuse, the illegal “unmasking” of individuals in NSA data by Obama officials. And as Representative Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), then chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said, these violations had “nothing to do” with Russia or national security matters. They were all about weaponizing and politicizing the intelligence functions.
Representative Nunes was one of many who came to Admiral Rogers’ defense when he was attacked by Carter, Clapper, and the Washington Post. Nunes’ defense of Rogers, as well as his pit-bull tenacity in exposing the criminal deeds of the coup plotters, soon earned him even more vicious attacks in the Deep State-aligned press than had been dished out to the NSA chief.
Taking Out His Teammates
For much the same reasons that they wanted to get rid of Admiral Rogers, the Deep State’s globalist elites wanted to make sure that General Michael Flynn would not survive as President Trump’s national security advisor. General Flynn had been director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under President Obama. However, he had been forced out, into early retirement, in 2014 by Clapper and Obama. He shares many of the traits of Admiral Rogers that make the insiders of the Obama-Biden-Clinton-Pelosi circles of power (and those above them) very nervous. He knows too much and can’t be depended on to go along with their subversion of the Constitution and the rule of law. Thus, he was forced to resign, by a campaign of lies and innuendo, on February 13, 2017, only 24 days after having been sworn in.
However, General Flynn’s long ordeal was just beginning. The coup plotters were determined to make an example of him, to crush him, to send him to prison. They very nearly succeeded. Four years later, the general’s tribulation is still not over. The Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr filed a motion on May 7, 2020 to dismiss with prejudice the charges against Flynn. The DOJ motion noted that Flynn’s questioning “was untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation.” However, federal district judge Emmet G. Sullivan has refused to dismiss the case and continues to fight the dismissal with extraordinary measures.
The pretext for the vendetta against General Flynn is the charge that he lied about the content and nature of his communications with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. This was all part and parcel of the hoax aimed at convincing the American public that Donald Trump and other members of his team were colluding with and/or were compromised by Russia and Vladimir Putin. The congressional investigations found no evidence to substantiate these charges. Neither did the much-ballyhooed two-year “Russia probe” by Office of Special Counsel (OSC) Robert Mueller. Nor did any of the media sleuths who had been trumpeting the “Russia, Russia, Russia” theme for four years.
Many stakes have been driven into the heart of the “Russia collusion” corpse, but the latest one delivered by FBI agent William Barnett this past September may finally do the job. Barnett, who was the FBI’s lead agent on the Flynn case, has described the investigation and prosecution of Flynn as an operation to “get Trump.” Barnett says he and other FBI and CIA investigators and analysts recognized early on that the probe was an “exercise in futility” and that the prosecutors were “groping” to find a crime. According to Barnett, top Mueller team prosecutors such as Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Weissmann were “obsessed” with finding a Trump-Russia connection and used overly aggressive tactics to obtain what they wanted. He says he had to intervene multiple times during interviews with Flynn and others due to misleading questions by Mueller team members.
FBI Director James Comey, Special Counsel Robert Mueller (a former FBI director), and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates had stacked the FBI/DOJ/OSC investigations with virulently partisan, anti-Trump staffers, as the notorious e-mail and text messages of FBI Agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page show.
Real Collusion: Russia-Hillary
On October 3, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified notes of former CIA Director John Brennan. It was an explosive revelation, but (surprise!) none of the “mainstream” media seemed to show the slightest interest. What did the notes reveal? They showed that Brennan had briefed former President Obama on July 26, 2016 concerning Hillary Clinton’s alleged “plan” to smear then-candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Russia as “a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.”
Brennan’s handwritten notes state:
We’re getting additional insight into Russian activities from [REDACTED]. . . CITE [summarizing] alleged approved by Hillary Clinton a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.
On July 31, 2016, five days after Brennan’s briefing of Obama on the Clinton scheme, Comey’s FBI opened its bogus “investigation” of the Trump campaign and its alleged ties to Russia.
Consider the enormity of this: The Steele dossier, as it has now been incontestably shown, was put together by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, with the assistance of Russian intelligence. It was then used by not only Hillary Clinton but also her co-conspirators Barack Obama, James Comey, James Clapper, Nancy Pelosi, Representative Adam Schiff, the Washington Post,the New York Times,CNN, CBS, and all the rest of the Deep State cabal to vilify Trump, precisely as directed in the Clinton scheme outlined in Brennan’s briefing to President Obama. So, it is Hillary Clinton who is the Russia colluder.
Then Clinton and her campaign lawyer Marc Elias repeatedly lied and denied any connection to the obscene “pee dossier” — until documentary evidence forced them to admit that they had financed it. Then Hil-lary switched her tune and even defended funding the dossier. It was just legit “opposition research,” she told ABC News.
Audacious it certainly was, especially since the Clinton-Russia ties go far deeper than her collusion with Russian intelligence to produce the aforementioned “Steele dossier.” It was/is Hillary Clinton (and her husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, and their Clinton Foundation), not Donald Trump, that has all the ties to Putin and Russia. As we have reported in The New American many times over the years, Hillary Clinton had notoriously concluded a number of deals with Putin’s regime that materially aided Russia’s military-industrial-techological advancement, while simultaneously striking serious blows to America’s national security. Along these lines we could mention, for example, the Uranium One deal that gave Russia a controlling interest in our American uranium production, and the technology transfers that have helped build Skolkovo, Russia’s hi-tech Silicon Valley.
Of course, that was already known by the Deep Staters who were, nevertheless, pushing the Trump-Russia theme with a vengeance.
Those Spreading the Lies
Thus far in this article we have focused primarily on the Deep State’s coup efforts through the operations of its captive intelligence agencies. This is not to suggest that all or even most of the men and women who serve in the FBI, CIA, DIA, and other intelligence-community agencies are parties to this treachery. Indeed, it is due to leaks and testimony from many brave and patriotic employees who have risked their careers, reputations, pensions — and even their lives — to expose the crimes and treason of the political hacks who are their bosses, that we know about the fraud and lies.
The intelligence community wields enormous power, but it is only one facet of the larger Deep State cabal that has been attacking the Trump administration — and America — from every angle and on every level.
Working closely in tandem with the Deep State intelligence community is the controlled establishment media, whose indispensable role we have highlighted in an article on page 16. Together with the Big Tech social-media giants and search engines — Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Reddit, Yahoo, Microsoft, Bing, etc. — they are transforming American society ever more rapidly to resemble the totalitarian system of Communist China. Not only are they dispensing statist prop-aganda that more and more mimics the Chinese Communist Party line, but in true Orwellian fashion they are blatantly punishing “thought crime” with censorship, demonetization, deplatforming, bullying, doxing, and label-lynching.
Deep State operatives within the intelligence community and throughout the federal bureaucracy also collude with the anti-Trump/anti-American media to produce a steady deluge of strategically timed leaks, many of which involve classified material, and all of which are calculated to disrupt and cripple the operations of government. Like the Antifa street thugs, they may as well adopt the revolutionary slogan, “Make America Ungovernable!”
Speaking of Antifa, we should mention here the important role they and their comrades in Black Lives Matter are playing in the orchestrated coup effort. Their job is to provide pressure from below while Deep State operatives in government and the media provide pressure from above. The BLM/Antifa rioters would have amounted to nothing except for: 1) the massive funding they have received from George Soros and other globalists; 2) the massive media promotion and propaganda they have enjoyed; 3) the enormous boost they have received from radical politicians and particularly from mayors and prosecutors (many of whom are Soros-funded) who refuse to prosecute the rioters; and 4) the crucial leadership of hard-core Marxist-Leninists of the Revolutionary Communist Party, the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and other revolutionary groups. But, naturally, these things are never mentioned by the controlled media, which would have us believe the lie that the BLM/Antifa mobs are authentic, grassroots organizations.
Still another important element of the ongoing coup effort is the campaign to expand and empower the United Nations and all of its programs. President Trump not only has initiated action to withdraw the United States from the disastrous UN Climate Accord, but also has terminated U.S. membership in UNESCO, WHO, and the UN Arms Trade Treaty, which is a thinly disguised attack on the Second Amendment. Obviously, these and other Trumpian attacks on the globalists’ New World Order could not be allowed to stand. Then we saw the convenient unleashing of the COVID-19 “pandemic” upon the world by Communist China to wreck the rebounding U.S. economy, while pro-Beijing globalists such as Bill Gates, George Soros, and their confreres at the Council on Foreign Relations and World Economic Forum have cheered the moves by Western governments to adopt Chinese-style totalitarianism and “global health governance.”
As we go to press (on November 5) the official results of the election are still up in the air, though it is obvious that operatives of the Deep State have been active at all levels, and using all illegal means at their disposal, to steal votes from President Trump and throw the count to Joe Biden. As the decision over who won the White House gets thrown to the courts, we can expect that the BLM/Antifa mobs will also be unleashed into the streets. There also are crucial U.S. Senate and House races that remain unresolved. The outcomes of these races will hugely impact our nation, not the least of matters being whether or not we will see a packing of the Supreme Court, as many leading Democrats are calling for.

‘Livid’ Limbaugh confident ‘Trump is going to win this’,"(Natural News) With no official winner declared in the 2020 presidential race, talk-radio star Rush Limbaugh said President Trump would, in fact, win the election when the final results are accurately sorted out.
(Article by Joe Kovacs republished from WND.com)
“Trump is going to win this,” Limbaugh said confidently on his national broadcast Wednesday. “We did, we have, we’ve reelected Trump. … This doesn’t mean that I’m not livid, and it doesn’t mean that I’m not ticked off and mad like all the rest of you are, because I am.”
“Donald Trump was not repudiated last night. Donald Trump was reelected last night. Time will show us this.”
Limbaugh, a staunch supporter of Trump and fellow resident of Palm Beach, Florida, said, “We were winning big last night. … That’s why they stopped the counting.”
“When they stopped counting, it means they’re looking for Democrat votes. It means they don’t have Democrat votes. It means they gotta go find ’em. We are wise to their ways now.”
“Why is it that every state that is not a swing state run by Democrats can keep their act together on Election Night?” he asked rhetorically.
“The Democrats, I can’t tell you how depressed they are today that Trump was not repudiated,” he continued. “That’s what they really wanted to happen.”
He said the Democratic mantra of “Count every ballot” is not legitimate.
“‘We’re not going to count every ballot. We’re going to count every legitimate vote. It’s a big difference. … We’re gonna win playing by the rules, despite the fact the other side does not.”
Limbaugh also suggested Fox News called the state of Arizona too early and mistakenly for Joe Biden as personal payback by the network after Trump had publicly criticized the network on “Fox and Friends” this week.
“It’s personal. It was absolutely personal. But Trump’s gonna end up winning Arizona. … I think he already has. It’s just a matter of this playing out.”
“That Arizona call, the investigation of that … I think it’s gonna reveal some fascinating things that are going on in the bowels of the decision desk at the Fox News Channel.”
He called the outcome of huge support for the president “a devastating night” for Democrats.
“It was so huge the Democrats never saw it coming,” he noted. “These people are vindictive. They are single-mindedly hateful … They have been waiting, and they have been dreaming, they have been hoping, they have been planning on, they have been counting on you and every other American telling Donald Trump to go to hell yesterday — and that didn’t happen. … They literally thought Trump was going to be sent packing.”
Limbaugh said he talked with White House officials who say anywhere from two-thirds to 70 percent of Arizona votes are coming to the president, meaning that state could be counted in Trump’s favor.
Limbaugh urged his listeners: “The American way of life is going to be preserved. Keep the faith. The best days of our country are still ahead of us.”
“We want love and peace in our lives. We want our lives to be pleasant.”

Video: Deranged Olbermann calls for coup against President Trump,"(Natural News) In a venom filled online rant, Keith Olbermann called for President Trump to be dragged out of the White House immediately in handcuffs.
(Article by swatson republished from Summit.news)
“TRUMP HAS LOST HIS MIND AND MUST BE REMOVED, TONIGHT,” Olbermann tweeted, along with the video of him ranting on his online program literally titled Olbermann vs Trump.
“The coup attempt, we can survive. A mentally incompetent president, we may not. Instead, he will stay, and when he concedes he will simultaneously begin a campaign for 2024.” Olbermann stated.
Olbermann called Trump “President Karen” and a “lame duck president.”
TRUMP MUST BE REMOVED AND ARRESTED, TONIGHT. Gripped by a paranoid delusion, threatening the nation's safety, this can't wait any longer. It won't happen; in fact he'll probably concede and instantly announce he's running in '24.

Here is the full 10 minute mental breakdown, for those who can stomach it:
President Trump vowed last night to take the matter of election theft to the highest court in the land, noting “We think there’ll be a lot of litigation, because we cannot have an election stolen like this.”
Once a respected newsreader who espoused nuanced positions including opposition to illegal invasions in the Middle East, Olbermann is now completely unhinged, engaging in endless ‘orange man bad’ rants.
Last month Olbermann said Trump should be executed over the handling of the coronavirus:

Left-wing media journalist says 75% of media writers have “side job destroying Trump ballots”,"(Natural News) Jon Schwarz, a prominent left-wing writer for The Intercept, thinks that destroying the ballots of people who vote for Donald Trump is the moral solution to preventing a second Trump term.
According to Schwarz, who also writes for The New York Times, The Atlantic and other far-left media outlets, “at least” 75 percent of those who work in the mainstream media – “including me,” he tweeted – have “a side job destroying Trump ballots.”
“When you love something as much as we love destroying Trump ballots, you make the time,” he tweeted back on Nov. 1, 2016.
Schwarz added in a series of other tweets the same day that destroying Trump ballots is “not a felony.” He also added that “the constitution says you can destroy trump ballots,” presumably joking – but how does one really tell anymore?
In a recent article he wrote entitled, “The Election Isn’t Over Until Trump’s Gone,” Schwarz suggested that people who hate Trump need to initiate “street fights” in the event that Trump wins reelection on Nov. 3.
Schwarz also believes that illegal aliens should not only be allowed to vote, but to do so multiple times until Democrat candidates are able to “win.”
A self-described alum of filmmaker Michael Moore’s Dog Eat Dog films, as well as “a research producer for Moore’s Capitalism: A Love Story,” Schwarz is hellbent on removing Trump from office through any means possible.
After being accused of visiting a voting site during the 2016 election “to fake IDs & assist in ferrying illegals from polling station to polling station,” Schwarz responded unashamedly with:
“let’s not rest on our laurels though, everyone’s needed in Wisconsin to destroy Trump ballots during the recount.”

Schwarz supports militant Antifa-backed Transition Integrity Project
Should Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not win in a landslide on Nov. 3, Schwarz’s allies over at the Transition Integrity Project (TIP) are planning to unleash hell across America.
The so-called “Fight Back Table” has indicated plans to initiate “mass public unrest” in the event that Trump wins, and Schwarz wants to take it all a step further with mass violence.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly taken notice of Schwarz’s statements and behavior, having launched an investigation into a positive reaction that Schwarz had to a tweet by Huffington Post editor Nick Baumann that reads:
“i love my job working at a voting site in washington dc destroying trump ballots.”
After Baumann came out to state that he was joking, Schwarz chimed in and stated that he:
“want[ed] to emphasize to the FBI that, while @nickbaumann was joking, I was completely serious. I am not kidding.”
Schwarz further bragged that he has supposedly “destroy[ed] 1000s of ballots,” further expressing confusion that the FBI “is investigating Nick for jokes when I’m the one who destroyed 1000s of ballots.”
Since “lots more people want [Trump] to be president” than Biden or anyone else – Schwarz’s words, not ours – Schwarz has made it his personal mission to “destroy the ballots” to try to keep Trump out of office.
Schwarz now claims that all of these tweets were mere jokes, despite the incredible volume of them that would suggest otherwise. He apparently thinks he is quite the funny guy who compensates for his lack of wit by suggesting that he commits election fraud for fun.
“Still waiting on your piece debunking police shooting stats,” wrote one Twitter user trying to get Schwarz’s attention concerning a promise he apparently made in an earlier article about police violence.
“It never materialize[d]. I guess you’re busy with other stuff.”

State Department is preventing Biden from accessing messages from foreign leaders,"Washington (CNN)A stack of messages from foreign leaders to President-elect Joe Biden are sitting at the State Department but the Trump administration is preventing him from accessing them, according to State Department officials familiar with the messages.
Traditionally, the State Department supports all communications for the President-elect, which is why many countries began sending messages to State over the weekend. But with Biden prohibited from accessing State Department resources by the Trump administration, because President Donald Trump refuses to accept Biden's victory, dozens of incoming messages have not been received.
Biden's team is contacting foreign governments on their own and he has held numerous calls with leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel and Canada's Justin Trudeau. But they are operating without the logistical and translation support that the State Department operations center provides.
""They would prefer to be using the State Department resources,"" said a source familiar with the situation, who noted that the Biden team is having to deal with the unexpected challenge of facilitating these calls.
Not only is Biden being blocked by the State Department from receiving messages and assistance facilitating and from preparing for calls, on Tuesday Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to acknowledge Biden's victory, saying that ""there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" igniting a furor and roiling diplomats.
Biden is also being blocked from getting the same intelligence briefings as the President, known as the President's Daily Brief, and should the Trump administration continue to block a typical transition close to Inauguration Day on January 20, there are concerns Biden's administration will be playing catch-up the day he takes office.
Foreign leaders have begun to figure out that State cannot get them in touch with the President-elect and their teams have reached out to former Obama-era diplomats for their assistance on how to send congratulatory messages to Biden's team, sources told CNN. Some foreign governments feel they are navigating an unfamiliar maze, foreign diplomats have told CNN.
""It was helpful to have State ops place the calls and to provide translation services, and we were grateful for the cooperation from the Bush administration for making that happen,"" said Denis McDonough, who served in the Obama administration and worked with Obama during the transition.
The calls taking place right now are not highly sensitive, and even during a well-oiled transition period they are not normally conducted on secure lines, multiple sources explained.
""These calls in the past have been handled on open lines. They are congratulatory calls,"" McDonough said, adding that both sides are providing readouts, which is consistent with protocol.
Barack Obama often made these calls to foreign leaders on his cell phone when he was President-elect, explained a State Department official who worked on setting up those calls at the time. But they all went through the operations center, which meant there is a government record of the calls he made.
Career officials at the State Department are ready to help the Biden team when the time comes.
""The agencies implemented the law faithfully prior to the election. The materials are ready, the offices are ready, everything is ready; they are waiting for the green light,"" said David Marchick, the director of the Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service.
Operating without State Department support right now, the Biden team -- made up of many experienced former government officials -- has sent out readouts of all of the calls, which help with record keeping. They are making an effort to formalize the process and will use State Department resources when they are available, said a source familiar with the unfolding situation.
This is a stark contrast with the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. At the time, President-elect Trump opted not to use State Department resources. Instead, he made his calls out of Trump Tower and resisted using the government support and coordination system, which meant that translators and staff sat waiting without any work while Trump made calls on his own, a State Department official told CNN at the time.
At any other point since Biden left the White House, he would have been able to call into the State Department operations center to place a call to a foreign leader, State Department officials told CNN. Former presidents and vice presidents are allowed to use the resource whenever they wish. But now, as he is President-elect, Biden is being prevented from using that facility by the Trump administration.

"White House political director tests positive for coronavirus, official says","(CNN)White House political affairs director Brian Jack has tested positive for coronavirus, an official confirmed to CNN on Wednesday.
The White House declined to comment on Jack specifically, but said in a statement that positive cases are ""taken seriously.""
""Contact tracing has been conducted by the White House Medical Unit consistent with CDC guidelines to stop further transmission. Appropriate notifications and recommendations have been made,"" the statement said.
Jack attended the election night party held indoors over a week ago. The news was first reported by The New York Times.

White House coronavirus task force warns of 'accelerating community spread',"(CNN)The White House coronavirus task force is again alerting states of ""accelerating"" coronavirus spread as cases and hospitalizations rapidly rise across the country with few signs of stabilizing. It strongly recommends increased testing in its weekly reports to states.
""There is continued, accelerating community spread across the top half of the country, where temperatures have cooled and Americans have moved indoors,"" reports dated November 8 and distributed to states Tuesday evening said.
The task force, which warned of ""significant deterioration in the Sunbelt"" in last week's set of reports, said that that deterioration has only continued in the past week, ""leading to the most diffuse spread experienced to date.""
The weekly task force reports continue to provide an unvarnished, unfiltered look at the reality of each state's current situation, which comes as President Donald Trump and task force leader Vice President Mike Pence have declined to address the worsening pandemic publicly in weeks. The White House has repeatedly declined to make all of the reports publicly accessible.
In recommendations to several states, the task force called for an expansion of testing, particularly to target asymptomatic cases.
""The silent community spread that precedes and continues throughout surges can only be identified and interrupted through proactive and increased testing and surveillance,"" reports for multiple states said, suggesting expanding point-of-care antigen tests.
The reports said: ""Proactive testing must be part of the mitigation efforts, inclusive of mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and immediate isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine.""
A report for New Mexico, where the task force said there is ""full and unrelenting community spread,"" noted that requiring testing only for individuals experiencing Covid-19 symptoms ""is preventing adequate testing and control of the pandemic.""
North Dakota remains the state with the highest number of new cases per 100,000 population, followed by South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana, Illinois, Utah and Minnesota in the top 10.
Vermont remains the state with the lowest number of cases and is one of only two states, including Hawaii, in the task force-defined ""yellow zone"" for new cases, meaning between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 population. But Vermont was still warned in its report that there is ""cause for concern given the continued uptick in the state"" coinciding with colder weather.
The report for Ohio described ""vast and unmitigated community spread"" with ""no evidence of improvement.""
In Delaware, where cases are disproportionately affecting young adults between 20 and 35 years of age, the task force said, ""We share the assessment of Delaware leaders that the Covid epidemic is likely to worsen.""
Some state reports reiterated the need for communication of ""basic actions"" residents should take.
""Do not gather without a mask with individuals living outside of your household,"" ""Always wear a mask in public places,"" ""Stop gatherings beyond immediate household until cases and test positivity are in the yellow zone"" and ""Get your flu shot,"" the reports warned.
And, as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, one state's report stressed the need for indoor mask usage.
""We need to protect those we are thankful for in our families and communities. Ensure indoor masking around vulnerable family members during any gatherings due to the significant amount of virus circulating and the high rate of asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections among family and community members,"" the report said.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/coronavirus-task-force-state-reports/index.html,Betsy Klein,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:22:00 GMT",CNN,1,
Alarm grows over Trump's 'dictator moves' as he denies election defeat,"(CNN)President Donald Trump's administration is taking on the characteristics of a tottering regime -- with its loyalty tests, destabilizing attacks on the military chain of command, a deepening bunker mentality and increasingly delusional claims of political victory.
In response, a visibly confident President-elect Joe Biden is going out of his way to project calm amid the deepening chaos, even as Trump and senior Republicans still refuse to acknowledge the President's defeat in a stunning break with America's democratic traditions.
Biden is taking calls with leaders of the country's top allies, which reflects the inevitability of his ascent to power. While the President is staying behind closed doors, tweeting in wild block capital letters and unleashing a purge of the Pentagon's civilian leadership, Biden is on camera. The President-elect is reassuring the American people with a composure granted by an election win that Trump's threadbare legal cases baselessly alleging massive voter fraud have little chance of overturning the will of the voters.
The President-elect on Tuesday consciously avoided escalating a confrontation with Trump, who is withholding the access and funding that incoming presidents normally rely on to stand up their administrations. But while Trump will remain President until January 20, an unmistakable symbolic transfer of authority is taking place despite Trump's efforts to deny his successor legitimacy.
""We don't see anything that's slowing us down, quite frankly,"" Biden said.
The President-elect has already crossed the necessary threshold of 270 electoral votes, according to projections from CNN and other major news outlets and has a chance of matching Trump's 2016 total of 306 electoral votes given his leads in Georgia and Arizona.
And more false accusations and conspiracy theories touted by Trump supporters to claim electoral fraud are dissolving, a day after Attorney General William Barr stepped into the political fray to advise prosecutors to probe major fraud.
The Department of Homeland Security meanwhile pushed back on rumors that ballots were cast on behalf of dead people.
But the Trump team only dug itself deeper into a bizarre parallel universe -- one where the President has already secured a second term -- consistent with the embrace of misinformation and alternative facts that has characterized the last four years.
The administration's defiance took an even more ridiculous twist on Tuesday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo showed his loyalty to a leader who shows no sign of working on key issues -- including a pandemic that has now landed more Americans in hospitals than ever before.
""There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" Pompeo said. Asked whether Trump's refusal to concede undercut traditional US critiques of corrupt elections abroad, Pompeo rounded on a reporter: ""That's ridiculous. And you know it's ridiculous, and you asked it because it's ridiculous."" As recently as Monday, Pompeo issued a statement warning of electoral issues in Myanmar, which was long ruled by the military and has endured a difficult transition to semi-democracy where dissidents once looked at the US as a lodestar.
In Wilmington, Delaware, the President-elect pointedly refused to pour fuel on the fire, dismissing the idea that he needed to take legal action to release transition funds and making clear that he was confident that the process of assuming power would eventually work itself out.
He described Trump's behavior since Election Day as ""an embarrassment"" and after saying he was seeking to be tactful added: ""It will not help the President's legacy."" Asked whether Republicans would ever accept his victory, he said, ""They will, they will,"" and he suggested with a half-smile that GOP senators were ""mildly intimidated"" by the President.
Biden, who once had a reputation as a windy public speaker, is showing a new persona to the American people. He noticeably chose his words carefully on Tuesday, putting on a show of calm, as he experiences the transformation that often comes over victorious candidates as they begin to assume the weight of the presidency after winning elections.
Trump by contrast is tarnishing the instruments of American democracy by refusing to concede and leaving the country more vulnerable with revenge firings that threaten to weaken critical national security agencies.
After Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had put loyalty to the Constitution ahead of his duty to the President, three other senior Pentagon officials have been fired or resigned. They include the department's top policy official, James Anderson, who resigned and is being replaced by retired Brigadier General Anthony Tata, whose nomination for the post earlier this summer foundered after CNN's KFile reported his numerous past Islamophobic and offensive remarks.
Sources told Barbara Starr and CNN's Pentagon team that the dismissals might be motivated by pushback from Esper and his team against a withdrawal from Afghanistan that would be carried out before the required conditions on the ground were met, and other pending security issues.
""This is scary, it's very unsettling,"" one defense official told CNN. ""These are dictator moves.""
A disputed transfer of power could offer US adversaries an opening, especially if there is a belief abroad that there is disarray in the national security infrastructure. Trump may next turn his ire on CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Christopher Wray, CNN's Jake Tapper has reported. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on CNN International Tuesday that he feared the US was entering a dangerous period.
""I think (Trump) is going to be uniquely distracted from world events and national security,"" Murphy said. Former national security adviser John Bolton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Pompeo's comments on a Trump transition were ""delusional.""
""I think he has eviscerated his credibility internationally because I think there are very few people even in the US government who believe that is the case,"" Bolton said.
Despite Trump's claims that his second term is being stolen from him, the President's legal claim has so far made no headway in its efforts to claim massive fraud. The gambit looks increasingly like a political exercise as Trump struggles to come to terms with his defeat while Republican senators scared of the President's political base refuse to cross him, especially with two Georgia run-off elections scheduled for January that will decide control of their chamber.
Trump's already minuscule opportunity to change the course of the election is diminishing by the day. Biden is now more than 46,000 votes ahead in Pennsylvania, is up by 12,000 in Georgia and has a lead of 14,000 ballots in Arizona. It is not clear whether there are sufficient remaining votes left in the Grand Canyon state for the President to overtake the President-elect.
As the Trump campaign filed a new long-shot lawsuit in Michigan, which Biden won by nearly than 150,000 votes, its communications director Tim Murtaugh said, ""We do believe that ultimately President Trump will be declared the winner of this election.""
But Benjamin Ginsberg, a veteran Republican election lawyer, said that the Trump campaign ""was a long way from nowhere"" in its quest to overturn the outcome of the election.
""To win cases, they have to put enough results into play to change the outcome of the election in individual states and in none of the suits they have filed around the country are they anywhere close to doing that in any state,"" Ginsberg said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""
Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dug in Tuesday on his insistence that Trump was within his rights to pursue his complaints.
""I think we ought to quit all the hand-wringing and not act like this is extraordinary,"" the newly reelected Kentucky Republican said.
""We're going to get through this period and we'll swear in the winner on January the 20th, 2021, just like we have every four years since 1793.""
While many observers believe McConnell is playing a long political game — with the Georgia run-offs and the 2022 midterm congressional elections in mind, the silence of Republican senators is emboldening Trump's intransigence.
The world has already moved on
But while GOP lawmakers aren't willing to break with the President, many world leaders are moving to embrace Biden -- including a number of whom who saw themselves as ideological counterparts of the President.
Biden's campaign released statements on the President-elect's calls with the leaders of France, Germany and Ireland. Biden also spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose populist leanings made him a good fit with Trump. Johnson promised to work with Biden in a post-Covid-19 era.
Even Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who bonded with Trump over their common strongman tendencies, issued a public message congratulating Biden on his ""election success."" And Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- who has a close and controversial relationship with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner -- sent Biden a cable in which they conveyed congratulations on ""His Excellency's victory in the presidential elections.""
Biden said he had a simple message for all the world leaders: ""I am letting them know America is back.""

Republican senator says he will step in if Biden doesn't have access to intelligence briefings by Friday,"(CNN)Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford said Wednesday that he will intervene if the Trump administration has not allowed President-elect Joe Biden access to presidential daily intelligence briefings by the end of the week, one of the first rights of a presidential candidate after winning the election.
""There is no loss from him getting the briefings and to be able to do that,"" Lankford told radio station KRMG, noting that he sits on the Senate Oversight Committee and that he's already started engaging on this issue.
The Oklahoma Republican said if no progress is made on the issue by Friday, he will step in and say, ""This needs to occur so that regardless of the outcome of the election, whichever way that it goes, people can be ready for that actual task.""
Lankford's comment comes as Biden and his senior advisers are not yet receiving the President's Daily Brief, the highly classified intelligence briefings about pressing national security issues that their soon-to-be predecessor has been offered daily.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Monday that Biden's lack of access stems from the election being not yet ascertained by the General Services Administration -- a clear indication that the Biden transition team is not getting the same briefings that presidents-elect typically receive.
It remains unclear whether the race needs to be ascertained before the President-elect can legally receive the briefings. Biden has said that the daily briefings ""would be useful, but it's not necessary.""
Lankford on Wednesday also referenced the abbreviated 2000 transition, which a bipartisan 9/11 report said contributed to a lack of security preparedness ahead of the 9/11 terror attacks.
""There's nothing wrong with Vice President Biden getting the briefings to be able to prepare himself and so that he can be ready -- the President's already getting those,"" Lankford said, adding that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a Democratic senator from California, also has the appropriate clearances to begin receiving briefings because she serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, also called for Biden to receive the briefings.
""As has been done in every other transition, the President should order that Biden and his team receive the PDB, as has been done in the past, even during the contested election of 2000,"" Warner said Wednesday. ""It's simply irresponsible to withhold this in these uncertain times.""
Like most of his Republican colleagues, Lankford did not go so far as to acknowledge that Biden is the president-elect after every major news organization projected his victory on Saturday.
Lankford defended the President's many legal disputes, saying the best thing right now is for Trump to be able to go through the legal process and ""get real answers"" before the Electoral College casts ballots in December.
There is no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in this election.
In the meantime, Lankford said, ""Joe Biden can continue to be able to function and say, 'I'm the president-elect,' and great if you want to say that, go do it, and to be able to do your preparation work. The President can say, 'Not so fast. I've got questions to answer.' Great, go ask them.""
Lankford implied that if the President is not able to follow through with its legal proceedings, it might stoke conspiracies among Trump supporters.
But judges have quickly dismissed cases that attempt to raise the possibility of voting irregularities, while elections experts make clear Biden's margin of victory is too wide for court cases to reverse and that existing court cases deal with too few votes, if any, to matter.
Asked about concerns at the Pentagon after Defense Secretary Mark Esper's firing on Monday and other moves by the administration that put a peaceful transfer of power into question, Lankford replied, ""I can assure you, there will be a peaceful transition of power in the United States.""
Lankford downplayed the significance of Esper's firing within days of the election, saying it was ""obviously long-planned"" and not just from a ""single petty event from months ago.""
He said, though, that he personally would not have made that change ""with the next two months"" -- seeming to refer to the two-month period until the inauguration -- again without fully acknowledging Biden as President-elect.
""It was a clear signal with preparation behind the scenes for a good transition at the Pentagon,"" Lankford said.

"Democrats create “Donald Trump Watch” website containing home addresses of Trump donors for Antifa, BLM to target","(Natural News) Left-wingers are once again showing their unique brand of love and tolerance for the opposition by launching a new website that doxes everyone in the country who contributed money to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, sharing their home addresses online.
Known as “Donald Trump Watch,” the site features an unsightly image of Trump grimacing alongside the words, “Americans that Give Money to Support a Racist.” Below it, users can search by zip code or street address to see who near them has ever donated money to Trump.
After plugging in an address or zip code, users are presented with a clickable map full of pins and addresses of Trump supporters in the area who supported a “racist” with their cash donations.
The top of the site features a quote from Voltaire that insinuates Trump is a dictator akin to Adolph Hitler:
“Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.”
Since the Donald Trump Watch site draws from publicly available information compiled by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), it is not technically illegal (as far as we know). However, it does tee-up Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Antifa to easily target Trump supporters for organized “protests.”
Why are the communist Chinese encouraging BLM, Antifa to commit violence against Trump supporters?
While claiming to be a privately owned entity not connected to any government agency, a little digging reveals that Donald Trump Watch is actually run by a company tied to the communist Chinese regime.
Dynadot LLC, the registered company associated with the site, is based out of San Mateo, Calif., but also has two offices in China – one in Zhenzhou and another in Beijing. Dynadot also apparently has an office in Toronto.
“Dynadot is a privately held ICANN accredited domain name registrar and web hosting company founded by software engineer Todd Han in 2002,” claims Wikipedia.
“Dynadot’s headquarters is established in San Mateo, California, with offices in Zhengzhou and Beijing, China, as well as Toronto, Canada.”
The group behind Dynadot is called Public Service Media Group, Inc., a corporation based out of Delaware where Joe Biden is from. It has three one-star reviews on Spokeo, one of which reads as follows:
“This company … is terrible, real scum lowlifes! They have a website where they publish all President Trump supporters / donors. So it makes it easier to be harassed by the terrorist group known as Antifa, which how they are still walking around beating up helpless people is beyond me!”
Another reviewer claims to be in pursuit of the owner of Public Service Media Group in order to file a lawsuit.
“He / she is responsible for a website called ‘Racism Watch’ that publishes names and addresses of individuals who make monetary donations to the Donald J. Trump campaign,” along with an email where information can be sent.
As far as we can tell, none of the major social media platforms have censored their users from sharing the link to Donald Trump Watch, despite the fact that it encourages people who hate Trump to harass and even harm his supporters and donors.
NBC News‘ Brandy Zadrozny would be proud, seeing as how she gets paid by her employer to do much the same, digging up information about Trump supporters in order to put them in the crosshairs of Antifa and BLM.
“The list isn’t going to tell anyone anything that the giant Trump flag outside my house isn’t already telling them,” wrote one commenter at The Gateway Pundit.
“But this is called terrorism, doxing people is a threat against people and their families in order to intimidate them into changing their behavior so that the terrorists can achieve a political objective. Antifa and all their allies need to be charged as terrorists.”

The non-stop effort to take down Trump and America,"(Natural News) On November 17, 2016, a meeting that may turn out to have been one of the most pivotal in American history took place at Trump Tower in New York City. On that day, nine days after the tumultuous 2016 presidential election, Admiral Michael S. Rogers met secretly with President-elect Donald Trump. It was a meeting that set off Deep State alarms, and those alarm bells instantly started echoing throughout the controlled Deep State media empire.
(Article by William F. Jasper republished from TheNewAmerican.com)
Why the intense anxiety? As director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Admiral Rogers was then also chief of the Central Security Service (CSS) and commander of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). He had previously served as the director for intelligence for both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. Pacific Command, as well as commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet and commander of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command. In other words, he was the top dog in the world of signals intelligence (SIGINT) and held the keys to the kingdom of America’s powerful surveillance-state apparatus.
What was Admiral Rogers doing at Trump Tower? According to globalist Deep State media assets, such as the Washington Post, NPR, and the New York Times, he was ingratiating himself to Donald Trump, hoping to get a job in the new administration as director of national intelligence (DNI), a position then held by Obama appointee James Clapper. The admiral’s detractors claim that he was about to be fired by President Obama for NSA intelligence failures and for his “aloof” leadership style. But according to Rogers’ defenders, the admiral’s journey to New York was a daring mission to warn the incoming president about a treasonous coup plot involving top members of the Obama administration and key leaders in the other intelligence agencies. And the media efforts to denigrate Rogers’ reputation were aimed precisely at publicly undermining his credibility and the warning he was delivering.
The extraordinary events of the past four years support the position of Admiral Rogers’ advocates, not his attackers. We all have witnessed, in real time, an unprecedented and ongoing coup effort in which high-level officials within the Trump administration, together with members of Congress, former government officials, media organizations, major think tanks, tax-exempt foundations, labor unions, and militant street mobs have carried out a coordinated and relentless campaign of disruption, subversion, insurrection, sabotage, and “resistance” to cripple and topple President Donald J. Trump. During that time, a continuous stream of revelations — through leaks, whistleblowers, inspector general reports, court rulings, congressional investigations, and Department of Justice investigations — has provided crucial witness testimony and documentary evidence to connect many of the dots.
Some of these crucial disclosures have only come to light in the final weeks leading up to the November 2020 elections. It has taken that long — the entire (first) term of the Trump presidency — to pry loose the damning evidence of criminality and treachery behind, for instance, the infamous (and phony) “Steele dossier”; the illegal FISA court warrants obtained for Spygate; the sham “Trump-Russia collusion” charge; the vicious FBI/DOJ/Mueller railroading of General Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Roger Stone, and Paul Manafort; the real evidence of Hillary Clinton-Russia collusion; the FBI/DOJ/Mueller collusion with Hillary Clinton, Fusion GPS, and Crowdstrike — and much, much more.
The Empire Strikes Back
The Trump Tower rendezvous between the president-elect and the NSA chief, understandably, caused a panic attack among the Deep State coup plotters. Although the actual content of the conversation between Trump and Rogers has not been publicly revealed, all indications are that the admiral spilled some pretty big beans. On the same day of that meeting, having apparently been apprised by Rogers that they were being spied upon, the Trump Transition Team surprised everyone with the abrupt announcement that they were immediately moving all transition activity to Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump then had a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, constructed at Trump Tower to prevent hostile surveillance — from enemies both foreign and domestic. On November 19, 2016, two days after that historic Trump-Rogers meeting, the attacks on Admiral Rogers began. Naturally, the Deep State conspirators chose the Washington Post, their longtime favorite disinformation spigot, to lead the smear campaign. The Post article, entitled “Pentagon and intelligence community chiefs have urged Obama to remove the head of the NSA,” stated, “The heads of the Pentagon and the nation’s intelligence community have recommended to President Obama that the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, be removed.”
“The recommendation, delivered to the White House last month,” the story continued, “was made by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to several U.S. officials familiar with the matter.” Typical of media hatchet jobs, the article was replete with alleged negative statements and allegations by anonymous “senior officials.”
Although it is dangerous to believe anything carried in that lie factory, it turns out the Post was correct in stating that top Department of Defense and intelligence community officials were urging President Obama to fire Admiral Rogers even before his trip to Trump Tower. Why? Well, as we subsequently learned, Rogers had been throwing sand into the gears of the coup plotters for the past year, challenging and thwarting their illegal activities. It appears that for months prior to the Trump Tower meeting, Rogers had been playing a cat-and-mouse game with the Obama administration and its lackeys in the “Intelligence Community.” Defense Secretary Ashton “Ash” Carter, who is also a director of the globalist-minded Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, took the lead in calling for his ouster. However, apparently it was Department of Justice National Security Division (DOJ-NSD) head John P. Carlin who had been assigned the job of deep-sixing the troublesome admiral.
Jeff Carlson, who writes for the Epoch Times and has posted some of the most detailed and perceptive articles on the coup intrigue, wrote that “Carlin was setting up Rogers as the scapegoat” for the very crimes Rogers was trying to stop and expose. Rogers had gone to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to report violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the Obama administration and members of the intelligence community. Section 702 of FISA is aimed at protecting Americans against warrantless search and seizure. Under Section 702, the NSA “may not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States.” Among additional prohibitions, it “may not intentionally target a U.S. person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.”
Carlin was the official at DOJ responsible for ensuring that the administration abided by FISA restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. However, he had covered for the Obama administration’s routine violation of those restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. Admiral Rogers became aware of the serious nature and extent of FISA violations and ordered the NSA’s Office of Compliance to “do a fundamental baseline review of compliance associated with 702.” Among the findings of the review was that the FBI, which had access to NSA intercepts, was illegally sharing this FISA data on individuals with private contractors. This criminal use of private contractors was one of a number of violations condemned by FISC presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer in her stinging rebuke of the FBI in her April 26, 2017 ruling. This FBI abuse apparently had been brought to her attention by Admiral Rogers, who had already shut down all FBI contractor access a year before, in April 2016. Although Judge Collyer’s ruling redacts the names of the contractors, various analysts have reasonably suggested from clues in the text, timelines, and related data that at least some of the contractors cited are very likely entities associated with Hillary Clinton’s campaign, such as Fusion GPS and Crowdstrike.
Additionally, the NSA compliance review found numerous “About Query” violations. “Rogers shut down all ‘about query’ activity on Oct. 21, 2016,” reported Jeff Carlson in the Epoch Times on December 20, 2019. “‘About queries’ are particularly worrisome,” Carlson noted, “since they occur when the target is neither the sender nor the recipient of the collected communication; rather, the target’s ‘query,’ such as an email address, is being passed between two other communicants.”
Admiral Rogers and the FISA court also dinged the FBI and DOJ for failure to comply with Standard Minimization Procedures. The website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) describes “minimization” as “a detailed set of procedures designed to minimize the acquisition, retention, use and dissemination of U.S. person information acquired under Section 702.”
Subsequent revelations highlighted another egregious intelligence abuse, the illegal “unmasking” of individuals in NSA data by Obama officials. And as Representative Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), then chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said, these violations had “nothing to do” with Russia or national security matters. They were all about weaponizing and politicizing the intelligence functions.
Representative Nunes was one of many who came to Admiral Rogers’ defense when he was attacked by Carter, Clapper, and the Washington Post. Nunes’ defense of Rogers, as well as his pit-bull tenacity in exposing the criminal deeds of the coup plotters, soon earned him even more vicious attacks in the Deep State-aligned press than had been dished out to the NSA chief.
Taking Out His Teammates
For much the same reasons that they wanted to get rid of Admiral Rogers, the Deep State’s globalist elites wanted to make sure that General Michael Flynn would not survive as President Trump’s national security advisor. General Flynn had been director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under President Obama. However, he had been forced out, into early retirement, in 2014 by Clapper and Obama. He shares many of the traits of Admiral Rogers that make the insiders of the Obama-Biden-Clinton-Pelosi circles of power (and those above them) very nervous. He knows too much and can’t be depended on to go along with their subversion of the Constitution and the rule of law. Thus, he was forced to resign, by a campaign of lies and innuendo, on February 13, 2017, only 24 days after having been sworn in.
However, General Flynn’s long ordeal was just beginning. The coup plotters were determined to make an example of him, to crush him, to send him to prison. They very nearly succeeded. Four years later, the general’s tribulation is still not over. The Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr filed a motion on May 7, 2020 to dismiss with prejudice the charges against Flynn. The DOJ motion noted that Flynn’s questioning “was untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation.” However, federal district judge Emmet G. Sullivan has refused to dismiss the case and continues to fight the dismissal with extraordinary measures.
The pretext for the vendetta against General Flynn is the charge that he lied about the content and nature of his communications with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. This was all part and parcel of the hoax aimed at convincing the American public that Donald Trump and other members of his team were colluding with and/or were compromised by Russia and Vladimir Putin. The congressional investigations found no evidence to substantiate these charges. Neither did the much-ballyhooed two-year “Russia probe” by Office of Special Counsel (OSC) Robert Mueller. Nor did any of the media sleuths who had been trumpeting the “Russia, Russia, Russia” theme for four years.
Many stakes have been driven into the heart of the “Russia collusion” corpse, but the latest one delivered by FBI agent William Barnett this past September may finally do the job. Barnett, who was the FBI’s lead agent on the Flynn case, has described the investigation and prosecution of Flynn as an operation to “get Trump.” Barnett says he and other FBI and CIA investigators and analysts recognized early on that the probe was an “exercise in futility” and that the prosecutors were “groping” to find a crime. According to Barnett, top Mueller team prosecutors such as Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Weissmann were “obsessed” with finding a Trump-Russia connection and used overly aggressive tactics to obtain what they wanted. He says he had to intervene multiple times during interviews with Flynn and others due to misleading questions by Mueller team members.
FBI Director James Comey, Special Counsel Robert Mueller (a former FBI director), and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates had stacked the FBI/DOJ/OSC investigations with virulently partisan, anti-Trump staffers, as the notorious e-mail and text messages of FBI Agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page show.
Real Collusion: Russia-Hillary
On October 3, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified notes of former CIA Director John Brennan. It was an explosive revelation, but (surprise!) none of the “mainstream” media seemed to show the slightest interest. What did the notes reveal? They showed that Brennan had briefed former President Obama on July 26, 2016 concerning Hillary Clinton’s alleged “plan” to smear then-candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Russia as “a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.”
Brennan’s handwritten notes state:
We’re getting additional insight into Russian activities from [REDACTED]. . . CITE [summarizing] alleged approved by Hillary Clinton a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.
On July 31, 2016, five days after Brennan’s briefing of Obama on the Clinton scheme, Comey’s FBI opened its bogus “investigation” of the Trump campaign and its alleged ties to Russia.
Consider the enormity of this: The Steele dossier, as it has now been incontestably shown, was put together by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, with the assistance of Russian intelligence. It was then used by not only Hillary Clinton but also her co-conspirators Barack Obama, James Comey, James Clapper, Nancy Pelosi, Representative Adam Schiff, the Washington Post,the New York Times,CNN, CBS, and all the rest of the Deep State cabal to vilify Trump, precisely as directed in the Clinton scheme outlined in Brennan’s briefing to President Obama. So, it is Hillary Clinton who is the Russia colluder.
Then Clinton and her campaign lawyer Marc Elias repeatedly lied and denied any connection to the obscene “pee dossier” — until documentary evidence forced them to admit that they had financed it. Then Hil-lary switched her tune and even defended funding the dossier. It was just legit “opposition research,” she told ABC News.
Audacious it certainly was, especially since the Clinton-Russia ties go far deeper than her collusion with Russian intelligence to produce the aforementioned “Steele dossier.” It was/is Hillary Clinton (and her husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, and their Clinton Foundation), not Donald Trump, that has all the ties to Putin and Russia. As we have reported in The New American many times over the years, Hillary Clinton had notoriously concluded a number of deals with Putin’s regime that materially aided Russia’s military-industrial-techological advancement, while simultaneously striking serious blows to America’s national security. Along these lines we could mention, for example, the Uranium One deal that gave Russia a controlling interest in our American uranium production, and the technology transfers that have helped build Skolkovo, Russia’s hi-tech Silicon Valley.
Of course, that was already known by the Deep Staters who were, nevertheless, pushing the Trump-Russia theme with a vengeance.
Those Spreading the Lies
Thus far in this article we have focused primarily on the Deep State’s coup efforts through the operations of its captive intelligence agencies. This is not to suggest that all or even most of the men and women who serve in the FBI, CIA, DIA, and other intelligence-community agencies are parties to this treachery. Indeed, it is due to leaks and testimony from many brave and patriotic employees who have risked their careers, reputations, pensions — and even their lives — to expose the crimes and treason of the political hacks who are their bosses, that we know about the fraud and lies.
The intelligence community wields enormous power, but it is only one facet of the larger Deep State cabal that has been attacking the Trump administration — and America — from every angle and on every level.
Working closely in tandem with the Deep State intelligence community is the controlled establishment media, whose indispensable role we have highlighted in an article on page 16. Together with the Big Tech social-media giants and search engines — Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Reddit, Yahoo, Microsoft, Bing, etc. — they are transforming American society ever more rapidly to resemble the totalitarian system of Communist China. Not only are they dispensing statist prop-aganda that more and more mimics the Chinese Communist Party line, but in true Orwellian fashion they are blatantly punishing “thought crime” with censorship, demonetization, deplatforming, bullying, doxing, and label-lynching.
Deep State operatives within the intelligence community and throughout the federal bureaucracy also collude with the anti-Trump/anti-American media to produce a steady deluge of strategically timed leaks, many of which involve classified material, and all of which are calculated to disrupt and cripple the operations of government. Like the Antifa street thugs, they may as well adopt the revolutionary slogan, “Make America Ungovernable!”
Speaking of Antifa, we should mention here the important role they and their comrades in Black Lives Matter are playing in the orchestrated coup effort. Their job is to provide pressure from below while Deep State operatives in government and the media provide pressure from above. The BLM/Antifa rioters would have amounted to nothing except for: 1) the massive funding they have received from George Soros and other globalists; 2) the massive media promotion and propaganda they have enjoyed; 3) the enormous boost they have received from radical politicians and particularly from mayors and prosecutors (many of whom are Soros-funded) who refuse to prosecute the rioters; and 4) the crucial leadership of hard-core Marxist-Leninists of the Revolutionary Communist Party, the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and other revolutionary groups. But, naturally, these things are never mentioned by the controlled media, which would have us believe the lie that the BLM/Antifa mobs are authentic, grassroots organizations.
Still another important element of the ongoing coup effort is the campaign to expand and empower the United Nations and all of its programs. President Trump not only has initiated action to withdraw the United States from the disastrous UN Climate Accord, but also has terminated U.S. membership in UNESCO, WHO, and the UN Arms Trade Treaty, which is a thinly disguised attack on the Second Amendment. Obviously, these and other Trumpian attacks on the globalists’ New World Order could not be allowed to stand. Then we saw the convenient unleashing of the COVID-19 “pandemic” upon the world by Communist China to wreck the rebounding U.S. economy, while pro-Beijing globalists such as Bill Gates, George Soros, and their confreres at the Council on Foreign Relations and World Economic Forum have cheered the moves by Western governments to adopt Chinese-style totalitarianism and “global health governance.”
As we go to press (on November 5) the official results of the election are still up in the air, though it is obvious that operatives of the Deep State have been active at all levels, and using all illegal means at their disposal, to steal votes from President Trump and throw the count to Joe Biden. As the decision over who won the White House gets thrown to the courts, we can expect that the BLM/Antifa mobs will also be unleashed into the streets. There also are crucial U.S. Senate and House races that remain unresolved. The outcomes of these races will hugely impact our nation, not the least of matters being whether or not we will see a packing of the Supreme Court, as many leading Democrats are calling for.

‘Livid’ Limbaugh confident ‘Trump is going to win this’,"(Natural News) With no official winner declared in the 2020 presidential race, talk-radio star Rush Limbaugh said President Trump would, in fact, win the election when the final results are accurately sorted out.
(Article by Joe Kovacs republished from WND.com)
“Trump is going to win this,” Limbaugh said confidently on his national broadcast Wednesday. “We did, we have, we’ve reelected Trump. … This doesn’t mean that I’m not livid, and it doesn’t mean that I’m not ticked off and mad like all the rest of you are, because I am.”
“Donald Trump was not repudiated last night. Donald Trump was reelected last night. Time will show us this.”
Limbaugh, a staunch supporter of Trump and fellow resident of Palm Beach, Florida, said, “We were winning big last night. … That’s why they stopped the counting.”
“When they stopped counting, it means they’re looking for Democrat votes. It means they don’t have Democrat votes. It means they gotta go find ’em. We are wise to their ways now.”
“Why is it that every state that is not a swing state run by Democrats can keep their act together on Election Night?” he asked rhetorically.
“The Democrats, I can’t tell you how depressed they are today that Trump was not repudiated,” he continued. “That’s what they really wanted to happen.”
He said the Democratic mantra of “Count every ballot” is not legitimate.
“‘We’re not going to count every ballot. We’re going to count every legitimate vote. It’s a big difference. … We’re gonna win playing by the rules, despite the fact the other side does not.”
Limbaugh also suggested Fox News called the state of Arizona too early and mistakenly for Joe Biden as personal payback by the network after Trump had publicly criticized the network on “Fox and Friends” this week.
“It’s personal. It was absolutely personal. But Trump’s gonna end up winning Arizona. … I think he already has. It’s just a matter of this playing out.”
“That Arizona call, the investigation of that … I think it’s gonna reveal some fascinating things that are going on in the bowels of the decision desk at the Fox News Channel.”
He called the outcome of huge support for the president “a devastating night” for Democrats.
“It was so huge the Democrats never saw it coming,” he noted. “These people are vindictive. They are single-mindedly hateful … They have been waiting, and they have been dreaming, they have been hoping, they have been planning on, they have been counting on you and every other American telling Donald Trump to go to hell yesterday — and that didn’t happen. … They literally thought Trump was going to be sent packing.”
Limbaugh said he talked with White House officials who say anywhere from two-thirds to 70 percent of Arizona votes are coming to the president, meaning that state could be counted in Trump’s favor.
Limbaugh urged his listeners: “The American way of life is going to be preserved. Keep the faith. The best days of our country are still ahead of us.”
“We want love and peace in our lives. We want our lives to be pleasant.”

Video: Deranged Olbermann calls for coup against President Trump,"(Natural News) In a venom filled online rant, Keith Olbermann called for President Trump to be dragged out of the White House immediately in handcuffs.
(Article by swatson republished from Summit.news)
“TRUMP HAS LOST HIS MIND AND MUST BE REMOVED, TONIGHT,” Olbermann tweeted, along with the video of him ranting on his online program literally titled Olbermann vs Trump.
“The coup attempt, we can survive. A mentally incompetent president, we may not. Instead, he will stay, and when he concedes he will simultaneously begin a campaign for 2024.” Olbermann stated.
Olbermann called Trump “President Karen” and a “lame duck president.”
TRUMP MUST BE REMOVED AND ARRESTED, TONIGHT. Gripped by a paranoid delusion, threatening the nation's safety, this can't wait any longer. It won't happen; in fact he'll probably concede and instantly announce he's running in '24.

Here is the full 10 minute mental breakdown, for those who can stomach it:
President Trump vowed last night to take the matter of election theft to the highest court in the land, noting “We think there’ll be a lot of litigation, because we cannot have an election stolen like this.”
Once a respected newsreader who espoused nuanced positions including opposition to illegal invasions in the Middle East, Olbermann is now completely unhinged, engaging in endless ‘orange man bad’ rants.
Last month Olbermann said Trump should be executed over the handling of the coronavirus:

Left-wing media journalist says 75% of media writers have “side job destroying Trump ballots”,"(Natural News) Jon Schwarz, a prominent left-wing writer for The Intercept, thinks that destroying the ballots of people who vote for Donald Trump is the moral solution to preventing a second Trump term.
According to Schwarz, who also writes for The New York Times, The Atlantic and other far-left media outlets, “at least” 75 percent of those who work in the mainstream media – “including me,” he tweeted – have “a side job destroying Trump ballots.”
“When you love something as much as we love destroying Trump ballots, you make the time,” he tweeted back on Nov. 1, 2016.
Schwarz added in a series of other tweets the same day that destroying Trump ballots is “not a felony.” He also added that “the constitution says you can destroy trump ballots,” presumably joking – but how does one really tell anymore?
In a recent article he wrote entitled, “The Election Isn’t Over Until Trump’s Gone,” Schwarz suggested that people who hate Trump need to initiate “street fights” in the event that Trump wins reelection on Nov. 3.
Schwarz also believes that illegal aliens should not only be allowed to vote, but to do so multiple times until Democrat candidates are able to “win.”
A self-described alum of filmmaker Michael Moore’s Dog Eat Dog films, as well as “a research producer for Moore’s Capitalism: A Love Story,” Schwarz is hellbent on removing Trump from office through any means possible.
After being accused of visiting a voting site during the 2016 election “to fake IDs & assist in ferrying illegals from polling station to polling station,” Schwarz responded unashamedly with:
“let’s not rest on our laurels though, everyone’s needed in Wisconsin to destroy Trump ballots during the recount.”

Schwarz supports militant Antifa-backed Transition Integrity Project
Should Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not win in a landslide on Nov. 3, Schwarz’s allies over at the Transition Integrity Project (TIP) are planning to unleash hell across America.
The so-called “Fight Back Table” has indicated plans to initiate “mass public unrest” in the event that Trump wins, and Schwarz wants to take it all a step further with mass violence.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly taken notice of Schwarz’s statements and behavior, having launched an investigation into a positive reaction that Schwarz had to a tweet by Huffington Post editor Nick Baumann that reads:
“i love my job working at a voting site in washington dc destroying trump ballots.”
After Baumann came out to state that he was joking, Schwarz chimed in and stated that he:
“want[ed] to emphasize to the FBI that, while @nickbaumann was joking, I was completely serious. I am not kidding.”
Schwarz further bragged that he has supposedly “destroy[ed] 1000s of ballots,” further expressing confusion that the FBI “is investigating Nick for jokes when I’m the one who destroyed 1000s of ballots.”
Since “lots more people want [Trump] to be president” than Biden or anyone else – Schwarz’s words, not ours – Schwarz has made it his personal mission to “destroy the ballots” to try to keep Trump out of office.
Schwarz now claims that all of these tweets were mere jokes, despite the incredible volume of them that would suggest otherwise. He apparently thinks he is quite the funny guy who compensates for his lack of wit by suggesting that he commits election fraud for fun.
“Still waiting on your piece debunking police shooting stats,” wrote one Twitter user trying to get Schwarz’s attention concerning a promise he apparently made in an earlier article about police violence.
“It never materialize[d]. I guess you’re busy with other stuff.”

State Department is preventing Biden from accessing messages from foreign leaders,"Washington (CNN)A stack of messages from foreign leaders to President-elect Joe Biden are sitting at the State Department but the Trump administration is preventing him from accessing them, according to State Department officials familiar with the messages.
Traditionally, the State Department supports all communications for the President-elect, which is why many countries began sending messages to State over the weekend. But with Biden prohibited from accessing State Department resources by the Trump administration, because President Donald Trump refuses to accept Biden's victory, dozens of incoming messages have not been received.
Biden's team is contacting foreign governments on their own and he has held numerous calls with leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel and Canada's Justin Trudeau. But they are operating without the logistical and translation support that the State Department operations center provides.
""They would prefer to be using the State Department resources,"" said a source familiar with the situation, who noted that the Biden team is having to deal with the unexpected challenge of facilitating these calls.
Not only is Biden being blocked by the State Department from receiving messages and assistance facilitating and from preparing for calls, on Tuesday Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to acknowledge Biden's victory, saying that ""there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" igniting a furor and roiling diplomats.
Biden is also being blocked from getting the same intelligence briefings as the President, known as the President's Daily Brief, and should the Trump administration continue to block a typical transition close to Inauguration Day on January 20, there are concerns Biden's administration will be playing catch-up the day he takes office.
Foreign leaders have begun to figure out that State cannot get them in touch with the President-elect and their teams have reached out to former Obama-era diplomats for their assistance on how to send congratulatory messages to Biden's team, sources told CNN. Some foreign governments feel they are navigating an unfamiliar maze, foreign diplomats have told CNN.
""It was helpful to have State ops place the calls and to provide translation services, and we were grateful for the cooperation from the Bush administration for making that happen,"" said Denis McDonough, who served in the Obama administration and worked with Obama during the transition.
The calls taking place right now are not highly sensitive, and even during a well-oiled transition period they are not normally conducted on secure lines, multiple sources explained.
""These calls in the past have been handled on open lines. They are congratulatory calls,"" McDonough said, adding that both sides are providing readouts, which is consistent with protocol.
Barack Obama often made these calls to foreign leaders on his cell phone when he was President-elect, explained a State Department official who worked on setting up those calls at the time. But they all went through the operations center, which meant there is a government record of the calls he made.
Career officials at the State Department are ready to help the Biden team when the time comes.
""The agencies implemented the law faithfully prior to the election. The materials are ready, the offices are ready, everything is ready; they are waiting for the green light,"" said David Marchick, the director of the Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service.
Operating without State Department support right now, the Biden team -- made up of many experienced former government officials -- has sent out readouts of all of the calls, which help with record keeping. They are making an effort to formalize the process and will use State Department resources when they are available, said a source familiar with the unfolding situation.
This is a stark contrast with the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. At the time, President-elect Trump opted not to use State Department resources. Instead, he made his calls out of Trump Tower and resisted using the government support and coordination system, which meant that translators and staff sat waiting without any work while Trump made calls on his own, a State Department official told CNN at the time.
At any other point since Biden left the White House, he would have been able to call into the State Department operations center to place a call to a foreign leader, State Department officials told CNN. Former presidents and vice presidents are allowed to use the resource whenever they wish. But now, as he is President-elect, Biden is being prevented from using that facility by the Trump administration.

"White House political director tests positive for coronavirus, official says","(CNN)White House political affairs director Brian Jack has tested positive for coronavirus, an official confirmed to CNN on Wednesday.
The White House declined to comment on Jack specifically, but said in a statement that positive cases are ""taken seriously.""
""Contact tracing has been conducted by the White House Medical Unit consistent with CDC guidelines to stop further transmission. Appropriate notifications and recommendations have been made,"" the statement said.
Jack attended the election night party held indoors over a week ago. The news was first reported by The New York Times.

White House coronavirus task force warns of 'accelerating community spread',"(CNN)The White House coronavirus task force is again alerting states of ""accelerating"" coronavirus spread as cases and hospitalizations rapidly rise across the country with few signs of stabilizing. It strongly recommends increased testing in its weekly reports to states.
""There is continued, accelerating community spread across the top half of the country, where temperatures have cooled and Americans have moved indoors,"" reports dated November 8 and distributed to states Tuesday evening said.
The task force, which warned of ""significant deterioration in the Sunbelt"" in last week's set of reports, said that that deterioration has only continued in the past week, ""leading to the most diffuse spread experienced to date.""
The weekly task force reports continue to provide an unvarnished, unfiltered look at the reality of each state's current situation, which comes as President Donald Trump and task force leader Vice President Mike Pence have declined to address the worsening pandemic publicly in weeks. The White House has repeatedly declined to make all of the reports publicly accessible.
In recommendations to several states, the task force called for an expansion of testing, particularly to target asymptomatic cases.
""The silent community spread that precedes and continues throughout surges can only be identified and interrupted through proactive and increased testing and surveillance,"" reports for multiple states said, suggesting expanding point-of-care antigen tests.
The reports said: ""Proactive testing must be part of the mitigation efforts, inclusive of mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and immediate isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine.""
A report for New Mexico, where the task force said there is ""full and unrelenting community spread,"" noted that requiring testing only for individuals experiencing Covid-19 symptoms ""is preventing adequate testing and control of the pandemic.""
North Dakota remains the state with the highest number of new cases per 100,000 population, followed by South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana, Illinois, Utah and Minnesota in the top 10.
Vermont remains the state with the lowest number of cases and is one of only two states, including Hawaii, in the task force-defined ""yellow zone"" for new cases, meaning between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 population. But Vermont was still warned in its report that there is ""cause for concern given the continued uptick in the state"" coinciding with colder weather.
The report for Ohio described ""vast and unmitigated community spread"" with ""no evidence of improvement.""
In Delaware, where cases are disproportionately affecting young adults between 20 and 35 years of age, the task force said, ""We share the assessment of Delaware leaders that the Covid epidemic is likely to worsen.""
Some state reports reiterated the need for communication of ""basic actions"" residents should take.
""Do not gather without a mask with individuals living outside of your household,"" ""Always wear a mask in public places,"" ""Stop gatherings beyond immediate household until cases and test positivity are in the yellow zone"" and ""Get your flu shot,"" the reports warned.
And, as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, one state's report stressed the need for indoor mask usage.
""We need to protect those we are thankful for in our families and communities. Ensure indoor masking around vulnerable family members during any gatherings due to the significant amount of virus circulating and the high rate of asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections among family and community members,"" the report said.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/coronavirus-task-force-state-reports/index.html,Betsy Klein,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:22:00 GMT",CNN,1,
Alarm grows over Trump's 'dictator moves' as he denies election defeat,"(CNN)President Donald Trump's administration is taking on the characteristics of a tottering regime -- with its loyalty tests, destabilizing attacks on the military chain of command, a deepening bunker mentality and increasingly delusional claims of political victory.
In response, a visibly confident President-elect Joe Biden is going out of his way to project calm amid the deepening chaos, even as Trump and senior Republicans still refuse to acknowledge the President's defeat in a stunning break with America's democratic traditions.
Biden is taking calls with leaders of the country's top allies, which reflects the inevitability of his ascent to power. While the President is staying behind closed doors, tweeting in wild block capital letters and unleashing a purge of the Pentagon's civilian leadership, Biden is on camera. The President-elect is reassuring the American people with a composure granted by an election win that Trump's threadbare legal cases baselessly alleging massive voter fraud have little chance of overturning the will of the voters.
The President-elect on Tuesday consciously avoided escalating a confrontation with Trump, who is withholding the access and funding that incoming presidents normally rely on to stand up their administrations. But while Trump will remain President until January 20, an unmistakable symbolic transfer of authority is taking place despite Trump's efforts to deny his successor legitimacy.
""We don't see anything that's slowing us down, quite frankly,"" Biden said.
The President-elect has already crossed the necessary threshold of 270 electoral votes, according to projections from CNN and other major news outlets and has a chance of matching Trump's 2016 total of 306 electoral votes given his leads in Georgia and Arizona.
And more false accusations and conspiracy theories touted by Trump supporters to claim electoral fraud are dissolving, a day after Attorney General William Barr stepped into the political fray to advise prosecutors to probe major fraud.
The Department of Homeland Security meanwhile pushed back on rumors that ballots were cast on behalf of dead people.
But the Trump team only dug itself deeper into a bizarre parallel universe -- one where the President has already secured a second term -- consistent with the embrace of misinformation and alternative facts that has characterized the last four years.
The administration's defiance took an even more ridiculous twist on Tuesday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo showed his loyalty to a leader who shows no sign of working on key issues -- including a pandemic that has now landed more Americans in hospitals than ever before.
""There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" Pompeo said. Asked whether Trump's refusal to concede undercut traditional US critiques of corrupt elections abroad, Pompeo rounded on a reporter: ""That's ridiculous. And you know it's ridiculous, and you asked it because it's ridiculous."" As recently as Monday, Pompeo issued a statement warning of electoral issues in Myanmar, which was long ruled by the military and has endured a difficult transition to semi-democracy where dissidents once looked at the US as a lodestar.
In Wilmington, Delaware, the President-elect pointedly refused to pour fuel on the fire, dismissing the idea that he needed to take legal action to release transition funds and making clear that he was confident that the process of assuming power would eventually work itself out.
He described Trump's behavior since Election Day as ""an embarrassment"" and after saying he was seeking to be tactful added: ""It will not help the President's legacy."" Asked whether Republicans would ever accept his victory, he said, ""They will, they will,"" and he suggested with a half-smile that GOP senators were ""mildly intimidated"" by the President.
Biden, who once had a reputation as a windy public speaker, is showing a new persona to the American people. He noticeably chose his words carefully on Tuesday, putting on a show of calm, as he experiences the transformation that often comes over victorious candidates as they begin to assume the weight of the presidency after winning elections.
Trump by contrast is tarnishing the instruments of American democracy by refusing to concede and leaving the country more vulnerable with revenge firings that threaten to weaken critical national security agencies.
After Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had put loyalty to the Constitution ahead of his duty to the President, three other senior Pentagon officials have been fired or resigned. They include the department's top policy official, James Anderson, who resigned and is being replaced by retired Brigadier General Anthony Tata, whose nomination for the post earlier this summer foundered after CNN's KFile reported his numerous past Islamophobic and offensive remarks.
Sources told Barbara Starr and CNN's Pentagon team that the dismissals might be motivated by pushback from Esper and his team against a withdrawal from Afghanistan that would be carried out before the required conditions on the ground were met, and other pending security issues.
""This is scary, it's very unsettling,"" one defense official told CNN. ""These are dictator moves.""
A disputed transfer of power could offer US adversaries an opening, especially if there is a belief abroad that there is disarray in the national security infrastructure. Trump may next turn his ire on CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Christopher Wray, CNN's Jake Tapper has reported. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on CNN International Tuesday that he feared the US was entering a dangerous period.
""I think (Trump) is going to be uniquely distracted from world events and national security,"" Murphy said. Former national security adviser John Bolton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Pompeo's comments on a Trump transition were ""delusional.""
""I think he has eviscerated his credibility internationally because I think there are very few people even in the US government who believe that is the case,"" Bolton said.
Despite Trump's claims that his second term is being stolen from him, the President's legal claim has so far made no headway in its efforts to claim massive fraud. The gambit looks increasingly like a political exercise as Trump struggles to come to terms with his defeat while Republican senators scared of the President's political base refuse to cross him, especially with two Georgia run-off elections scheduled for January that will decide control of their chamber.
Trump's already minuscule opportunity to change the course of the election is diminishing by the day. Biden is now more than 46,000 votes ahead in Pennsylvania, is up by 12,000 in Georgia and has a lead of 14,000 ballots in Arizona. It is not clear whether there are sufficient remaining votes left in the Grand Canyon state for the President to overtake the President-elect.
As the Trump campaign filed a new long-shot lawsuit in Michigan, which Biden won by nearly than 150,000 votes, its communications director Tim Murtaugh said, ""We do believe that ultimately President Trump will be declared the winner of this election.""
But Benjamin Ginsberg, a veteran Republican election lawyer, said that the Trump campaign ""was a long way from nowhere"" in its quest to overturn the outcome of the election.
""To win cases, they have to put enough results into play to change the outcome of the election in individual states and in none of the suits they have filed around the country are they anywhere close to doing that in any state,"" Ginsberg said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""
Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dug in Tuesday on his insistence that Trump was within his rights to pursue his complaints.
""I think we ought to quit all the hand-wringing and not act like this is extraordinary,"" the newly reelected Kentucky Republican said.
""We're going to get through this period and we'll swear in the winner on January the 20th, 2021, just like we have every four years since 1793.""
While many observers believe McConnell is playing a long political game — with the Georgia run-offs and the 2022 midterm congressional elections in mind, the silence of Republican senators is emboldening Trump's intransigence.
The world has already moved on
But while GOP lawmakers aren't willing to break with the President, many world leaders are moving to embrace Biden -- including a number of whom who saw themselves as ideological counterparts of the President.
Biden's campaign released statements on the President-elect's calls with the leaders of France, Germany and Ireland. Biden also spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose populist leanings made him a good fit with Trump. Johnson promised to work with Biden in a post-Covid-19 era.
Even Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who bonded with Trump over their common strongman tendencies, issued a public message congratulating Biden on his ""election success."" And Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- who has a close and controversial relationship with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner -- sent Biden a cable in which they conveyed congratulations on ""His Excellency's victory in the presidential elections.""
Biden said he had a simple message for all the world leaders: ""I am letting them know America is back.""

Republican senator says he will step in if Biden doesn't have access to intelligence briefings by Friday,"(CNN)Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford said Wednesday that he will intervene if the Trump administration has not allowed President-elect Joe Biden access to presidential daily intelligence briefings by the end of the week, one of the first rights of a presidential candidate after winning the election.
""There is no loss from him getting the briefings and to be able to do that,"" Lankford told radio station KRMG, noting that he sits on the Senate Oversight Committee and that he's already started engaging on this issue.
The Oklahoma Republican said if no progress is made on the issue by Friday, he will step in and say, ""This needs to occur so that regardless of the outcome of the election, whichever way that it goes, people can be ready for that actual task.""
Lankford's comment comes as Biden and his senior advisers are not yet receiving the President's Daily Brief, the highly classified intelligence briefings about pressing national security issues that their soon-to-be predecessor has been offered daily.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Monday that Biden's lack of access stems from the election being not yet ascertained by the General Services Administration -- a clear indication that the Biden transition team is not getting the same briefings that presidents-elect typically receive.
It remains unclear whether the race needs to be ascertained before the President-elect can legally receive the briefings. Biden has said that the daily briefings ""would be useful, but it's not necessary.""
Lankford on Wednesday also referenced the abbreviated 2000 transition, which a bipartisan 9/11 report said contributed to a lack of security preparedness ahead of the 9/11 terror attacks.
""There's nothing wrong with Vice President Biden getting the briefings to be able to prepare himself and so that he can be ready -- the President's already getting those,"" Lankford said, adding that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a Democratic senator from California, also has the appropriate clearances to begin receiving briefings because she serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, also called for Biden to receive the briefings.
""As has been done in every other transition, the President should order that Biden and his team receive the PDB, as has been done in the past, even during the contested election of 2000,"" Warner said Wednesday. ""It's simply irresponsible to withhold this in these uncertain times.""
Like most of his Republican colleagues, Lankford did not go so far as to acknowledge that Biden is the president-elect after every major news organization projected his victory on Saturday.
Lankford defended the President's many legal disputes, saying the best thing right now is for Trump to be able to go through the legal process and ""get real answers"" before the Electoral College casts ballots in December.
There is no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in this election.
In the meantime, Lankford said, ""Joe Biden can continue to be able to function and say, 'I'm the president-elect,' and great if you want to say that, go do it, and to be able to do your preparation work. The President can say, 'Not so fast. I've got questions to answer.' Great, go ask them.""
Lankford implied that if the President is not able to follow through with its legal proceedings, it might stoke conspiracies among Trump supporters.
But judges have quickly dismissed cases that attempt to raise the possibility of voting irregularities, while elections experts make clear Biden's margin of victory is too wide for court cases to reverse and that existing court cases deal with too few votes, if any, to matter.
Asked about concerns at the Pentagon after Defense Secretary Mark Esper's firing on Monday and other moves by the administration that put a peaceful transfer of power into question, Lankford replied, ""I can assure you, there will be a peaceful transition of power in the United States.""
Lankford downplayed the significance of Esper's firing within days of the election, saying it was ""obviously long-planned"" and not just from a ""single petty event from months ago.""
He said, though, that he personally would not have made that change ""with the next two months"" -- seeming to refer to the two-month period until the inauguration -- again without fully acknowledging Biden as President-elect.
""It was a clear signal with preparation behind the scenes for a good transition at the Pentagon,"" Lankford said.

"Democrats create “Donald Trump Watch” website containing home addresses of Trump donors for Antifa, BLM to target","(Natural News) Left-wingers are once again showing their unique brand of love and tolerance for the opposition by launching a new website that doxes everyone in the country who contributed money to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, sharing their home addresses online.
Known as “Donald Trump Watch,” the site features an unsightly image of Trump grimacing alongside the words, “Americans that Give Money to Support a Racist.” Below it, users can search by zip code or street address to see who near them has ever donated money to Trump.
After plugging in an address or zip code, users are presented with a clickable map full of pins and addresses of Trump supporters in the area who supported a “racist” with their cash donations.
The top of the site features a quote from Voltaire that insinuates Trump is a dictator akin to Adolph Hitler:
“Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.”
Since the Donald Trump Watch site draws from publicly available information compiled by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), it is not technically illegal (as far as we know). However, it does tee-up Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Antifa to easily target Trump supporters for organized “protests.”
Why are the communist Chinese encouraging BLM, Antifa to commit violence against Trump supporters?
While claiming to be a privately owned entity not connected to any government agency, a little digging reveals that Donald Trump Watch is actually run by a company tied to the communist Chinese regime.
Dynadot LLC, the registered company associated with the site, is based out of San Mateo, Calif., but also has two offices in China – one in Zhenzhou and another in Beijing. Dynadot also apparently has an office in Toronto.
“Dynadot is a privately held ICANN accredited domain name registrar and web hosting company founded by software engineer Todd Han in 2002,” claims Wikipedia.
“Dynadot’s headquarters is established in San Mateo, California, with offices in Zhengzhou and Beijing, China, as well as Toronto, Canada.”
The group behind Dynadot is called Public Service Media Group, Inc., a corporation based out of Delaware where Joe Biden is from. It has three one-star reviews on Spokeo, one of which reads as follows:
“This company … is terrible, real scum lowlifes! They have a website where they publish all President Trump supporters / donors. So it makes it easier to be harassed by the terrorist group known as Antifa, which how they are still walking around beating up helpless people is beyond me!”
Another reviewer claims to be in pursuit of the owner of Public Service Media Group in order to file a lawsuit.
“He / she is responsible for a website called ‘Racism Watch’ that publishes names and addresses of individuals who make monetary donations to the Donald J. Trump campaign,” along with an email where information can be sent.
As far as we can tell, none of the major social media platforms have censored their users from sharing the link to Donald Trump Watch, despite the fact that it encourages people who hate Trump to harass and even harm his supporters and donors.
NBC News‘ Brandy Zadrozny would be proud, seeing as how she gets paid by her employer to do much the same, digging up information about Trump supporters in order to put them in the crosshairs of Antifa and BLM.
“The list isn’t going to tell anyone anything that the giant Trump flag outside my house isn’t already telling them,” wrote one commenter at The Gateway Pundit.
“But this is called terrorism, doxing people is a threat against people and their families in order to intimidate them into changing their behavior so that the terrorists can achieve a political objective. Antifa and all their allies need to be charged as terrorists.”

The non-stop effort to take down Trump and America,"(Natural News) On November 17, 2016, a meeting that may turn out to have been one of the most pivotal in American history took place at Trump Tower in New York City. On that day, nine days after the tumultuous 2016 presidential election, Admiral Michael S. Rogers met secretly with President-elect Donald Trump. It was a meeting that set off Deep State alarms, and those alarm bells instantly started echoing throughout the controlled Deep State media empire.
(Article by William F. Jasper republished from TheNewAmerican.com)
Why the intense anxiety? As director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Admiral Rogers was then also chief of the Central Security Service (CSS) and commander of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). He had previously served as the director for intelligence for both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. Pacific Command, as well as commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet and commander of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command. In other words, he was the top dog in the world of signals intelligence (SIGINT) and held the keys to the kingdom of America’s powerful surveillance-state apparatus.
What was Admiral Rogers doing at Trump Tower? According to globalist Deep State media assets, such as the Washington Post, NPR, and the New York Times, he was ingratiating himself to Donald Trump, hoping to get a job in the new administration as director of national intelligence (DNI), a position then held by Obama appointee James Clapper. The admiral’s detractors claim that he was about to be fired by President Obama for NSA intelligence failures and for his “aloof” leadership style. But according to Rogers’ defenders, the admiral’s journey to New York was a daring mission to warn the incoming president about a treasonous coup plot involving top members of the Obama administration and key leaders in the other intelligence agencies. And the media efforts to denigrate Rogers’ reputation were aimed precisely at publicly undermining his credibility and the warning he was delivering.
The extraordinary events of the past four years support the position of Admiral Rogers’ advocates, not his attackers. We all have witnessed, in real time, an unprecedented and ongoing coup effort in which high-level officials within the Trump administration, together with members of Congress, former government officials, media organizations, major think tanks, tax-exempt foundations, labor unions, and militant street mobs have carried out a coordinated and relentless campaign of disruption, subversion, insurrection, sabotage, and “resistance” to cripple and topple President Donald J. Trump. During that time, a continuous stream of revelations — through leaks, whistleblowers, inspector general reports, court rulings, congressional investigations, and Department of Justice investigations — has provided crucial witness testimony and documentary evidence to connect many of the dots.
Some of these crucial disclosures have only come to light in the final weeks leading up to the November 2020 elections. It has taken that long — the entire (first) term of the Trump presidency — to pry loose the damning evidence of criminality and treachery behind, for instance, the infamous (and phony) “Steele dossier”; the illegal FISA court warrants obtained for Spygate; the sham “Trump-Russia collusion” charge; the vicious FBI/DOJ/Mueller railroading of General Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Roger Stone, and Paul Manafort; the real evidence of Hillary Clinton-Russia collusion; the FBI/DOJ/Mueller collusion with Hillary Clinton, Fusion GPS, and Crowdstrike — and much, much more.
The Empire Strikes Back
The Trump Tower rendezvous between the president-elect and the NSA chief, understandably, caused a panic attack among the Deep State coup plotters. Although the actual content of the conversation between Trump and Rogers has not been publicly revealed, all indications are that the admiral spilled some pretty big beans. On the same day of that meeting, having apparently been apprised by Rogers that they were being spied upon, the Trump Transition Team surprised everyone with the abrupt announcement that they were immediately moving all transition activity to Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump then had a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, constructed at Trump Tower to prevent hostile surveillance — from enemies both foreign and domestic. On November 19, 2016, two days after that historic Trump-Rogers meeting, the attacks on Admiral Rogers began. Naturally, the Deep State conspirators chose the Washington Post, their longtime favorite disinformation spigot, to lead the smear campaign. The Post article, entitled “Pentagon and intelligence community chiefs have urged Obama to remove the head of the NSA,” stated, “The heads of the Pentagon and the nation’s intelligence community have recommended to President Obama that the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, be removed.”
“The recommendation, delivered to the White House last month,” the story continued, “was made by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to several U.S. officials familiar with the matter.” Typical of media hatchet jobs, the article was replete with alleged negative statements and allegations by anonymous “senior officials.”
Although it is dangerous to believe anything carried in that lie factory, it turns out the Post was correct in stating that top Department of Defense and intelligence community officials were urging President Obama to fire Admiral Rogers even before his trip to Trump Tower. Why? Well, as we subsequently learned, Rogers had been throwing sand into the gears of the coup plotters for the past year, challenging and thwarting their illegal activities. It appears that for months prior to the Trump Tower meeting, Rogers had been playing a cat-and-mouse game with the Obama administration and its lackeys in the “Intelligence Community.” Defense Secretary Ashton “Ash” Carter, who is also a director of the globalist-minded Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, took the lead in calling for his ouster. However, apparently it was Department of Justice National Security Division (DOJ-NSD) head John P. Carlin who had been assigned the job of deep-sixing the troublesome admiral.
Jeff Carlson, who writes for the Epoch Times and has posted some of the most detailed and perceptive articles on the coup intrigue, wrote that “Carlin was setting up Rogers as the scapegoat” for the very crimes Rogers was trying to stop and expose. Rogers had gone to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to report violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the Obama administration and members of the intelligence community. Section 702 of FISA is aimed at protecting Americans against warrantless search and seizure. Under Section 702, the NSA “may not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States.” Among additional prohibitions, it “may not intentionally target a U.S. person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.”
Carlin was the official at DOJ responsible for ensuring that the administration abided by FISA restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. However, he had covered for the Obama administration’s routine violation of those restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. Admiral Rogers became aware of the serious nature and extent of FISA violations and ordered the NSA’s Office of Compliance to “do a fundamental baseline review of compliance associated with 702.” Among the findings of the review was that the FBI, which had access to NSA intercepts, was illegally sharing this FISA data on individuals with private contractors. This criminal use of private contractors was one of a number of violations condemned by FISC presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer in her stinging rebuke of the FBI in her April 26, 2017 ruling. This FBI abuse apparently had been brought to her attention by Admiral Rogers, who had already shut down all FBI contractor access a year before, in April 2016. Although Judge Collyer’s ruling redacts the names of the contractors, various analysts have reasonably suggested from clues in the text, timelines, and related data that at least some of the contractors cited are very likely entities associated with Hillary Clinton’s campaign, such as Fusion GPS and Crowdstrike.
Additionally, the NSA compliance review found numerous “About Query” violations. “Rogers shut down all ‘about query’ activity on Oct. 21, 2016,” reported Jeff Carlson in the Epoch Times on December 20, 2019. “‘About queries’ are particularly worrisome,” Carlson noted, “since they occur when the target is neither the sender nor the recipient of the collected communication; rather, the target’s ‘query,’ such as an email address, is being passed between two other communicants.”
Admiral Rogers and the FISA court also dinged the FBI and DOJ for failure to comply with Standard Minimization Procedures. The website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) describes “minimization” as “a detailed set of procedures designed to minimize the acquisition, retention, use and dissemination of U.S. person information acquired under Section 702.”
Subsequent revelations highlighted another egregious intelligence abuse, the illegal “unmasking” of individuals in NSA data by Obama officials. And as Representative Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), then chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said, these violations had “nothing to do” with Russia or national security matters. They were all about weaponizing and politicizing the intelligence functions.
Representative Nunes was one of many who came to Admiral Rogers’ defense when he was attacked by Carter, Clapper, and the Washington Post. Nunes’ defense of Rogers, as well as his pit-bull tenacity in exposing the criminal deeds of the coup plotters, soon earned him even more vicious attacks in the Deep State-aligned press than had been dished out to the NSA chief.
Taking Out His Teammates
For much the same reasons that they wanted to get rid of Admiral Rogers, the Deep State’s globalist elites wanted to make sure that General Michael Flynn would not survive as President Trump’s national security advisor. General Flynn had been director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under President Obama. However, he had been forced out, into early retirement, in 2014 by Clapper and Obama. He shares many of the traits of Admiral Rogers that make the insiders of the Obama-Biden-Clinton-Pelosi circles of power (and those above them) very nervous. He knows too much and can’t be depended on to go along with their subversion of the Constitution and the rule of law. Thus, he was forced to resign, by a campaign of lies and innuendo, on February 13, 2017, only 24 days after having been sworn in.
However, General Flynn’s long ordeal was just beginning. The coup plotters were determined to make an example of him, to crush him, to send him to prison. They very nearly succeeded. Four years later, the general’s tribulation is still not over. The Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr filed a motion on May 7, 2020 to dismiss with prejudice the charges against Flynn. The DOJ motion noted that Flynn’s questioning “was untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation.” However, federal district judge Emmet G. Sullivan has refused to dismiss the case and continues to fight the dismissal with extraordinary measures.
The pretext for the vendetta against General Flynn is the charge that he lied about the content and nature of his communications with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. This was all part and parcel of the hoax aimed at convincing the American public that Donald Trump and other members of his team were colluding with and/or were compromised by Russia and Vladimir Putin. The congressional investigations found no evidence to substantiate these charges. Neither did the much-ballyhooed two-year “Russia probe” by Office of Special Counsel (OSC) Robert Mueller. Nor did any of the media sleuths who had been trumpeting the “Russia, Russia, Russia” theme for four years.
Many stakes have been driven into the heart of the “Russia collusion” corpse, but the latest one delivered by FBI agent William Barnett this past September may finally do the job. Barnett, who was the FBI’s lead agent on the Flynn case, has described the investigation and prosecution of Flynn as an operation to “get Trump.” Barnett says he and other FBI and CIA investigators and analysts recognized early on that the probe was an “exercise in futility” and that the prosecutors were “groping” to find a crime. According to Barnett, top Mueller team prosecutors such as Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Weissmann were “obsessed” with finding a Trump-Russia connection and used overly aggressive tactics to obtain what they wanted. He says he had to intervene multiple times during interviews with Flynn and others due to misleading questions by Mueller team members.
FBI Director James Comey, Special Counsel Robert Mueller (a former FBI director), and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates had stacked the FBI/DOJ/OSC investigations with virulently partisan, anti-Trump staffers, as the notorious e-mail and text messages of FBI Agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page show.
Real Collusion: Russia-Hillary
On October 3, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified notes of former CIA Director John Brennan. It was an explosive revelation, but (surprise!) none of the “mainstream” media seemed to show the slightest interest. What did the notes reveal? They showed that Brennan had briefed former President Obama on July 26, 2016 concerning Hillary Clinton’s alleged “plan” to smear then-candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Russia as “a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.”
Brennan’s handwritten notes state:
We’re getting additional insight into Russian activities from [REDACTED]. . . CITE [summarizing] alleged approved by Hillary Clinton a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.
On July 31, 2016, five days after Brennan’s briefing of Obama on the Clinton scheme, Comey’s FBI opened its bogus “investigation” of the Trump campaign and its alleged ties to Russia.
Consider the enormity of this: The Steele dossier, as it has now been incontestably shown, was put together by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, with the assistance of Russian intelligence. It was then used by not only Hillary Clinton but also her co-conspirators Barack Obama, James Comey, James Clapper, Nancy Pelosi, Representative Adam Schiff, the Washington Post,the New York Times,CNN, CBS, and all the rest of the Deep State cabal to vilify Trump, precisely as directed in the Clinton scheme outlined in Brennan’s briefing to President Obama. So, it is Hillary Clinton who is the Russia colluder.
Then Clinton and her campaign lawyer Marc Elias repeatedly lied and denied any connection to the obscene “pee dossier” — until documentary evidence forced them to admit that they had financed it. Then Hil-lary switched her tune and even defended funding the dossier. It was just legit “opposition research,” she told ABC News.
Audacious it certainly was, especially since the Clinton-Russia ties go far deeper than her collusion with Russian intelligence to produce the aforementioned “Steele dossier.” It was/is Hillary Clinton (and her husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, and their Clinton Foundation), not Donald Trump, that has all the ties to Putin and Russia. As we have reported in The New American many times over the years, Hillary Clinton had notoriously concluded a number of deals with Putin’s regime that materially aided Russia’s military-industrial-techological advancement, while simultaneously striking serious blows to America’s national security. Along these lines we could mention, for example, the Uranium One deal that gave Russia a controlling interest in our American uranium production, and the technology transfers that have helped build Skolkovo, Russia’s hi-tech Silicon Valley.
Of course, that was already known by the Deep Staters who were, nevertheless, pushing the Trump-Russia theme with a vengeance.
Those Spreading the Lies
Thus far in this article we have focused primarily on the Deep State’s coup efforts through the operations of its captive intelligence agencies. This is not to suggest that all or even most of the men and women who serve in the FBI, CIA, DIA, and other intelligence-community agencies are parties to this treachery. Indeed, it is due to leaks and testimony from many brave and patriotic employees who have risked their careers, reputations, pensions — and even their lives — to expose the crimes and treason of the political hacks who are their bosses, that we know about the fraud and lies.
The intelligence community wields enormous power, but it is only one facet of the larger Deep State cabal that has been attacking the Trump administration — and America — from every angle and on every level.
Working closely in tandem with the Deep State intelligence community is the controlled establishment media, whose indispensable role we have highlighted in an article on page 16. Together with the Big Tech social-media giants and search engines — Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Reddit, Yahoo, Microsoft, Bing, etc. — they are transforming American society ever more rapidly to resemble the totalitarian system of Communist China. Not only are they dispensing statist prop-aganda that more and more mimics the Chinese Communist Party line, but in true Orwellian fashion they are blatantly punishing “thought crime” with censorship, demonetization, deplatforming, bullying, doxing, and label-lynching.
Deep State operatives within the intelligence community and throughout the federal bureaucracy also collude with the anti-Trump/anti-American media to produce a steady deluge of strategically timed leaks, many of which involve classified material, and all of which are calculated to disrupt and cripple the operations of government. Like the Antifa street thugs, they may as well adopt the revolutionary slogan, “Make America Ungovernable!”
Speaking of Antifa, we should mention here the important role they and their comrades in Black Lives Matter are playing in the orchestrated coup effort. Their job is to provide pressure from below while Deep State operatives in government and the media provide pressure from above. The BLM/Antifa rioters would have amounted to nothing except for: 1) the massive funding they have received from George Soros and other globalists; 2) the massive media promotion and propaganda they have enjoyed; 3) the enormous boost they have received from radical politicians and particularly from mayors and prosecutors (many of whom are Soros-funded) who refuse to prosecute the rioters; and 4) the crucial leadership of hard-core Marxist-Leninists of the Revolutionary Communist Party, the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and other revolutionary groups. But, naturally, these things are never mentioned by the controlled media, which would have us believe the lie that the BLM/Antifa mobs are authentic, grassroots organizations.
Still another important element of the ongoing coup effort is the campaign to expand and empower the United Nations and all of its programs. President Trump not only has initiated action to withdraw the United States from the disastrous UN Climate Accord, but also has terminated U.S. membership in UNESCO, WHO, and the UN Arms Trade Treaty, which is a thinly disguised attack on the Second Amendment. Obviously, these and other Trumpian attacks on the globalists’ New World Order could not be allowed to stand. Then we saw the convenient unleashing of the COVID-19 “pandemic” upon the world by Communist China to wreck the rebounding U.S. economy, while pro-Beijing globalists such as Bill Gates, George Soros, and their confreres at the Council on Foreign Relations and World Economic Forum have cheered the moves by Western governments to adopt Chinese-style totalitarianism and “global health governance.”
As we go to press (on November 5) the official results of the election are still up in the air, though it is obvious that operatives of the Deep State have been active at all levels, and using all illegal means at their disposal, to steal votes from President Trump and throw the count to Joe Biden. As the decision over who won the White House gets thrown to the courts, we can expect that the BLM/Antifa mobs will also be unleashed into the streets. There also are crucial U.S. Senate and House races that remain unresolved. The outcomes of these races will hugely impact our nation, not the least of matters being whether or not we will see a packing of the Supreme Court, as many leading Democrats are calling for.

‘Livid’ Limbaugh confident ‘Trump is going to win this’,"(Natural News) With no official winner declared in the 2020 presidential race, talk-radio star Rush Limbaugh said President Trump would, in fact, win the election when the final results are accurately sorted out.
(Article by Joe Kovacs republished from WND.com)
“Trump is going to win this,” Limbaugh said confidently on his national broadcast Wednesday. “We did, we have, we’ve reelected Trump. … This doesn’t mean that I’m not livid, and it doesn’t mean that I’m not ticked off and mad like all the rest of you are, because I am.”
“Donald Trump was not repudiated last night. Donald Trump was reelected last night. Time will show us this.”
Limbaugh, a staunch supporter of Trump and fellow resident of Palm Beach, Florida, said, “We were winning big last night. … That’s why they stopped the counting.”
“When they stopped counting, it means they’re looking for Democrat votes. It means they don’t have Democrat votes. It means they gotta go find ’em. We are wise to their ways now.”
“Why is it that every state that is not a swing state run by Democrats can keep their act together on Election Night?” he asked rhetorically.
“The Democrats, I can’t tell you how depressed they are today that Trump was not repudiated,” he continued. “That’s what they really wanted to happen.”
He said the Democratic mantra of “Count every ballot” is not legitimate.
“‘We’re not going to count every ballot. We’re going to count every legitimate vote. It’s a big difference. … We’re gonna win playing by the rules, despite the fact the other side does not.”
Limbaugh also suggested Fox News called the state of Arizona too early and mistakenly for Joe Biden as personal payback by the network after Trump had publicly criticized the network on “Fox and Friends” this week.
“It’s personal. It was absolutely personal. But Trump’s gonna end up winning Arizona. … I think he already has. It’s just a matter of this playing out.”
“That Arizona call, the investigation of that … I think it’s gonna reveal some fascinating things that are going on in the bowels of the decision desk at the Fox News Channel.”
He called the outcome of huge support for the president “a devastating night” for Democrats.
“It was so huge the Democrats never saw it coming,” he noted. “These people are vindictive. They are single-mindedly hateful … They have been waiting, and they have been dreaming, they have been hoping, they have been planning on, they have been counting on you and every other American telling Donald Trump to go to hell yesterday — and that didn’t happen. … They literally thought Trump was going to be sent packing.”
Limbaugh said he talked with White House officials who say anywhere from two-thirds to 70 percent of Arizona votes are coming to the president, meaning that state could be counted in Trump’s favor.
Limbaugh urged his listeners: “The American way of life is going to be preserved. Keep the faith. The best days of our country are still ahead of us.”
“We want love and peace in our lives. We want our lives to be pleasant.”

Video: Deranged Olbermann calls for coup against President Trump,"(Natural News) In a venom filled online rant, Keith Olbermann called for President Trump to be dragged out of the White House immediately in handcuffs.
(Article by swatson republished from Summit.news)
“TRUMP HAS LOST HIS MIND AND MUST BE REMOVED, TONIGHT,” Olbermann tweeted, along with the video of him ranting on his online program literally titled Olbermann vs Trump.
“The coup attempt, we can survive. A mentally incompetent president, we may not. Instead, he will stay, and when he concedes he will simultaneously begin a campaign for 2024.” Olbermann stated.
Olbermann called Trump “President Karen” and a “lame duck president.”
TRUMP MUST BE REMOVED AND ARRESTED, TONIGHT. Gripped by a paranoid delusion, threatening the nation's safety, this can't wait any longer. It won't happen; in fact he'll probably concede and instantly announce he's running in '24.

Here is the full 10 minute mental breakdown, for those who can stomach it:
President Trump vowed last night to take the matter of election theft to the highest court in the land, noting “We think there’ll be a lot of litigation, because we cannot have an election stolen like this.”
Once a respected newsreader who espoused nuanced positions including opposition to illegal invasions in the Middle East, Olbermann is now completely unhinged, engaging in endless ‘orange man bad’ rants.
Last month Olbermann said Trump should be executed over the handling of the coronavirus:

Left-wing media journalist says 75% of media writers have “side job destroying Trump ballots”,"(Natural News) Jon Schwarz, a prominent left-wing writer for The Intercept, thinks that destroying the ballots of people who vote for Donald Trump is the moral solution to preventing a second Trump term.
According to Schwarz, who also writes for The New York Times, The Atlantic and other far-left media outlets, “at least” 75 percent of those who work in the mainstream media – “including me,” he tweeted – have “a side job destroying Trump ballots.”
“When you love something as much as we love destroying Trump ballots, you make the time,” he tweeted back on Nov. 1, 2016.
Schwarz added in a series of other tweets the same day that destroying Trump ballots is “not a felony.” He also added that “the constitution says you can destroy trump ballots,” presumably joking – but how does one really tell anymore?
In a recent article he wrote entitled, “The Election Isn’t Over Until Trump’s Gone,” Schwarz suggested that people who hate Trump need to initiate “street fights” in the event that Trump wins reelection on Nov. 3.
Schwarz also believes that illegal aliens should not only be allowed to vote, but to do so multiple times until Democrat candidates are able to “win.”
A self-described alum of filmmaker Michael Moore’s Dog Eat Dog films, as well as “a research producer for Moore’s Capitalism: A Love Story,” Schwarz is hellbent on removing Trump from office through any means possible.
After being accused of visiting a voting site during the 2016 election “to fake IDs & assist in ferrying illegals from polling station to polling station,” Schwarz responded unashamedly with:
“let’s not rest on our laurels though, everyone’s needed in Wisconsin to destroy Trump ballots during the recount.”

Schwarz supports militant Antifa-backed Transition Integrity Project
Should Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not win in a landslide on Nov. 3, Schwarz’s allies over at the Transition Integrity Project (TIP) are planning to unleash hell across America.
The so-called “Fight Back Table” has indicated plans to initiate “mass public unrest” in the event that Trump wins, and Schwarz wants to take it all a step further with mass violence.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly taken notice of Schwarz’s statements and behavior, having launched an investigation into a positive reaction that Schwarz had to a tweet by Huffington Post editor Nick Baumann that reads:
“i love my job working at a voting site in washington dc destroying trump ballots.”
After Baumann came out to state that he was joking, Schwarz chimed in and stated that he:
“want[ed] to emphasize to the FBI that, while @nickbaumann was joking, I was completely serious. I am not kidding.”
Schwarz further bragged that he has supposedly “destroy[ed] 1000s of ballots,” further expressing confusion that the FBI “is investigating Nick for jokes when I’m the one who destroyed 1000s of ballots.”
Since “lots more people want [Trump] to be president” than Biden or anyone else – Schwarz’s words, not ours – Schwarz has made it his personal mission to “destroy the ballots” to try to keep Trump out of office.
Schwarz now claims that all of these tweets were mere jokes, despite the incredible volume of them that would suggest otherwise. He apparently thinks he is quite the funny guy who compensates for his lack of wit by suggesting that he commits election fraud for fun.
“Still waiting on your piece debunking police shooting stats,” wrote one Twitter user trying to get Schwarz’s attention concerning a promise he apparently made in an earlier article about police violence.
“It never materialize[d]. I guess you’re busy with other stuff.”

State Department is preventing Biden from accessing messages from foreign leaders,"Washington (CNN)A stack of messages from foreign leaders to President-elect Joe Biden are sitting at the State Department but the Trump administration is preventing him from accessing them, according to State Department officials familiar with the messages.
Traditionally, the State Department supports all communications for the President-elect, which is why many countries began sending messages to State over the weekend. But with Biden prohibited from accessing State Department resources by the Trump administration, because President Donald Trump refuses to accept Biden's victory, dozens of incoming messages have not been received.
Biden's team is contacting foreign governments on their own and he has held numerous calls with leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel and Canada's Justin Trudeau. But they are operating without the logistical and translation support that the State Department operations center provides.
""They would prefer to be using the State Department resources,"" said a source familiar with the situation, who noted that the Biden team is having to deal with the unexpected challenge of facilitating these calls.
Not only is Biden being blocked by the State Department from receiving messages and assistance facilitating and from preparing for calls, on Tuesday Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to acknowledge Biden's victory, saying that ""there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" igniting a furor and roiling diplomats.
Biden is also being blocked from getting the same intelligence briefings as the President, known as the President's Daily Brief, and should the Trump administration continue to block a typical transition close to Inauguration Day on January 20, there are concerns Biden's administration will be playing catch-up the day he takes office.
Foreign leaders have begun to figure out that State cannot get them in touch with the President-elect and their teams have reached out to former Obama-era diplomats for their assistance on how to send congratulatory messages to Biden's team, sources told CNN. Some foreign governments feel they are navigating an unfamiliar maze, foreign diplomats have told CNN.
""It was helpful to have State ops place the calls and to provide translation services, and we were grateful for the cooperation from the Bush administration for making that happen,"" said Denis McDonough, who served in the Obama administration and worked with Obama during the transition.
The calls taking place right now are not highly sensitive, and even during a well-oiled transition period they are not normally conducted on secure lines, multiple sources explained.
""These calls in the past have been handled on open lines. They are congratulatory calls,"" McDonough said, adding that both sides are providing readouts, which is consistent with protocol.
Barack Obama often made these calls to foreign leaders on his cell phone when he was President-elect, explained a State Department official who worked on setting up those calls at the time. But they all went through the operations center, which meant there is a government record of the calls he made.
Career officials at the State Department are ready to help the Biden team when the time comes.
""The agencies implemented the law faithfully prior to the election. The materials are ready, the offices are ready, everything is ready; they are waiting for the green light,"" said David Marchick, the director of the Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service.
Operating without State Department support right now, the Biden team -- made up of many experienced former government officials -- has sent out readouts of all of the calls, which help with record keeping. They are making an effort to formalize the process and will use State Department resources when they are available, said a source familiar with the unfolding situation.
This is a stark contrast with the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. At the time, President-elect Trump opted not to use State Department resources. Instead, he made his calls out of Trump Tower and resisted using the government support and coordination system, which meant that translators and staff sat waiting without any work while Trump made calls on his own, a State Department official told CNN at the time.
At any other point since Biden left the White House, he would have been able to call into the State Department operations center to place a call to a foreign leader, State Department officials told CNN. Former presidents and vice presidents are allowed to use the resource whenever they wish. But now, as he is President-elect, Biden is being prevented from using that facility by the Trump administration.

"White House political director tests positive for coronavirus, official says","(CNN)White House political affairs director Brian Jack has tested positive for coronavirus, an official confirmed to CNN on Wednesday.
The White House declined to comment on Jack specifically, but said in a statement that positive cases are ""taken seriously.""
""Contact tracing has been conducted by the White House Medical Unit consistent with CDC guidelines to stop further transmission. Appropriate notifications and recommendations have been made,"" the statement said.
Jack attended the election night party held indoors over a week ago. The news was first reported by The New York Times.

White House coronavirus task force warns of 'accelerating community spread',"(CNN)The White House coronavirus task force is again alerting states of ""accelerating"" coronavirus spread as cases and hospitalizations rapidly rise across the country with few signs of stabilizing. It strongly recommends increased testing in its weekly reports to states.
""There is continued, accelerating community spread across the top half of the country, where temperatures have cooled and Americans have moved indoors,"" reports dated November 8 and distributed to states Tuesday evening said.
The task force, which warned of ""significant deterioration in the Sunbelt"" in last week's set of reports, said that that deterioration has only continued in the past week, ""leading to the most diffuse spread experienced to date.""
The weekly task force reports continue to provide an unvarnished, unfiltered look at the reality of each state's current situation, which comes as President Donald Trump and task force leader Vice President Mike Pence have declined to address the worsening pandemic publicly in weeks. The White House has repeatedly declined to make all of the reports publicly accessible.
In recommendations to several states, the task force called for an expansion of testing, particularly to target asymptomatic cases.
""The silent community spread that precedes and continues throughout surges can only be identified and interrupted through proactive and increased testing and surveillance,"" reports for multiple states said, suggesting expanding point-of-care antigen tests.
The reports said: ""Proactive testing must be part of the mitigation efforts, inclusive of mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and immediate isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine.""
A report for New Mexico, where the task force said there is ""full and unrelenting community spread,"" noted that requiring testing only for individuals experiencing Covid-19 symptoms ""is preventing adequate testing and control of the pandemic.""
North Dakota remains the state with the highest number of new cases per 100,000 population, followed by South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana, Illinois, Utah and Minnesota in the top 10.
Vermont remains the state with the lowest number of cases and is one of only two states, including Hawaii, in the task force-defined ""yellow zone"" for new cases, meaning between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 population. But Vermont was still warned in its report that there is ""cause for concern given the continued uptick in the state"" coinciding with colder weather.
The report for Ohio described ""vast and unmitigated community spread"" with ""no evidence of improvement.""
In Delaware, where cases are disproportionately affecting young adults between 20 and 35 years of age, the task force said, ""We share the assessment of Delaware leaders that the Covid epidemic is likely to worsen.""
Some state reports reiterated the need for communication of ""basic actions"" residents should take.
""Do not gather without a mask with individuals living outside of your household,"" ""Always wear a mask in public places,"" ""Stop gatherings beyond immediate household until cases and test positivity are in the yellow zone"" and ""Get your flu shot,"" the reports warned.
And, as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, one state's report stressed the need for indoor mask usage.
""We need to protect those we are thankful for in our families and communities. Ensure indoor masking around vulnerable family members during any gatherings due to the significant amount of virus circulating and the high rate of asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections among family and community members,"" the report said.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/coronavirus-task-force-state-reports/index.html,Betsy Klein,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:22:00 GMT",CNN,1,
Alarm grows over Trump's 'dictator moves' as he denies election defeat,"(CNN)President Donald Trump's administration is taking on the characteristics of a tottering regime -- with its loyalty tests, destabilizing attacks on the military chain of command, a deepening bunker mentality and increasingly delusional claims of political victory.
In response, a visibly confident President-elect Joe Biden is going out of his way to project calm amid the deepening chaos, even as Trump and senior Republicans still refuse to acknowledge the President's defeat in a stunning break with America's democratic traditions.
Biden is taking calls with leaders of the country's top allies, which reflects the inevitability of his ascent to power. While the President is staying behind closed doors, tweeting in wild block capital letters and unleashing a purge of the Pentagon's civilian leadership, Biden is on camera. The President-elect is reassuring the American people with a composure granted by an election win that Trump's threadbare legal cases baselessly alleging massive voter fraud have little chance of overturning the will of the voters.
The President-elect on Tuesday consciously avoided escalating a confrontation with Trump, who is withholding the access and funding that incoming presidents normally rely on to stand up their administrations. But while Trump will remain President until January 20, an unmistakable symbolic transfer of authority is taking place despite Trump's efforts to deny his successor legitimacy.
""We don't see anything that's slowing us down, quite frankly,"" Biden said.
The President-elect has already crossed the necessary threshold of 270 electoral votes, according to projections from CNN and other major news outlets and has a chance of matching Trump's 2016 total of 306 electoral votes given his leads in Georgia and Arizona.
And more false accusations and conspiracy theories touted by Trump supporters to claim electoral fraud are dissolving, a day after Attorney General William Barr stepped into the political fray to advise prosecutors to probe major fraud.
The Department of Homeland Security meanwhile pushed back on rumors that ballots were cast on behalf of dead people.
But the Trump team only dug itself deeper into a bizarre parallel universe -- one where the President has already secured a second term -- consistent with the embrace of misinformation and alternative facts that has characterized the last four years.
The administration's defiance took an even more ridiculous twist on Tuesday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo showed his loyalty to a leader who shows no sign of working on key issues -- including a pandemic that has now landed more Americans in hospitals than ever before.
""There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" Pompeo said. Asked whether Trump's refusal to concede undercut traditional US critiques of corrupt elections abroad, Pompeo rounded on a reporter: ""That's ridiculous. And you know it's ridiculous, and you asked it because it's ridiculous."" As recently as Monday, Pompeo issued a statement warning of electoral issues in Myanmar, which was long ruled by the military and has endured a difficult transition to semi-democracy where dissidents once looked at the US as a lodestar.
In Wilmington, Delaware, the President-elect pointedly refused to pour fuel on the fire, dismissing the idea that he needed to take legal action to release transition funds and making clear that he was confident that the process of assuming power would eventually work itself out.
He described Trump's behavior since Election Day as ""an embarrassment"" and after saying he was seeking to be tactful added: ""It will not help the President's legacy."" Asked whether Republicans would ever accept his victory, he said, ""They will, they will,"" and he suggested with a half-smile that GOP senators were ""mildly intimidated"" by the President.
Biden, who once had a reputation as a windy public speaker, is showing a new persona to the American people. He noticeably chose his words carefully on Tuesday, putting on a show of calm, as he experiences the transformation that often comes over victorious candidates as they begin to assume the weight of the presidency after winning elections.
Trump by contrast is tarnishing the instruments of American democracy by refusing to concede and leaving the country more vulnerable with revenge firings that threaten to weaken critical national security agencies.
After Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had put loyalty to the Constitution ahead of his duty to the President, three other senior Pentagon officials have been fired or resigned. They include the department's top policy official, James Anderson, who resigned and is being replaced by retired Brigadier General Anthony Tata, whose nomination for the post earlier this summer foundered after CNN's KFile reported his numerous past Islamophobic and offensive remarks.
Sources told Barbara Starr and CNN's Pentagon team that the dismissals might be motivated by pushback from Esper and his team against a withdrawal from Afghanistan that would be carried out before the required conditions on the ground were met, and other pending security issues.
""This is scary, it's very unsettling,"" one defense official told CNN. ""These are dictator moves.""
A disputed transfer of power could offer US adversaries an opening, especially if there is a belief abroad that there is disarray in the national security infrastructure. Trump may next turn his ire on CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Christopher Wray, CNN's Jake Tapper has reported. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on CNN International Tuesday that he feared the US was entering a dangerous period.
""I think (Trump) is going to be uniquely distracted from world events and national security,"" Murphy said. Former national security adviser John Bolton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Pompeo's comments on a Trump transition were ""delusional.""
""I think he has eviscerated his credibility internationally because I think there are very few people even in the US government who believe that is the case,"" Bolton said.
Despite Trump's claims that his second term is being stolen from him, the President's legal claim has so far made no headway in its efforts to claim massive fraud. The gambit looks increasingly like a political exercise as Trump struggles to come to terms with his defeat while Republican senators scared of the President's political base refuse to cross him, especially with two Georgia run-off elections scheduled for January that will decide control of their chamber.
Trump's already minuscule opportunity to change the course of the election is diminishing by the day. Biden is now more than 46,000 votes ahead in Pennsylvania, is up by 12,000 in Georgia and has a lead of 14,000 ballots in Arizona. It is not clear whether there are sufficient remaining votes left in the Grand Canyon state for the President to overtake the President-elect.
As the Trump campaign filed a new long-shot lawsuit in Michigan, which Biden won by nearly than 150,000 votes, its communications director Tim Murtaugh said, ""We do believe that ultimately President Trump will be declared the winner of this election.""
But Benjamin Ginsberg, a veteran Republican election lawyer, said that the Trump campaign ""was a long way from nowhere"" in its quest to overturn the outcome of the election.
""To win cases, they have to put enough results into play to change the outcome of the election in individual states and in none of the suits they have filed around the country are they anywhere close to doing that in any state,"" Ginsberg said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""
Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dug in Tuesday on his insistence that Trump was within his rights to pursue his complaints.
""I think we ought to quit all the hand-wringing and not act like this is extraordinary,"" the newly reelected Kentucky Republican said.
""We're going to get through this period and we'll swear in the winner on January the 20th, 2021, just like we have every four years since 1793.""
While many observers believe McConnell is playing a long political game — with the Georgia run-offs and the 2022 midterm congressional elections in mind, the silence of Republican senators is emboldening Trump's intransigence.
The world has already moved on
But while GOP lawmakers aren't willing to break with the President, many world leaders are moving to embrace Biden -- including a number of whom who saw themselves as ideological counterparts of the President.
Biden's campaign released statements on the President-elect's calls with the leaders of France, Germany and Ireland. Biden also spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose populist leanings made him a good fit with Trump. Johnson promised to work with Biden in a post-Covid-19 era.
Even Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who bonded with Trump over their common strongman tendencies, issued a public message congratulating Biden on his ""election success."" And Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- who has a close and controversial relationship with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner -- sent Biden a cable in which they conveyed congratulations on ""His Excellency's victory in the presidential elections.""
Biden said he had a simple message for all the world leaders: ""I am letting them know America is back.""

Republican senator says he will step in if Biden doesn't have access to intelligence briefings by Friday,"(CNN)Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford said Wednesday that he will intervene if the Trump administration has not allowed President-elect Joe Biden access to presidential daily intelligence briefings by the end of the week, one of the first rights of a presidential candidate after winning the election.
""There is no loss from him getting the briefings and to be able to do that,"" Lankford told radio station KRMG, noting that he sits on the Senate Oversight Committee and that he's already started engaging on this issue.
The Oklahoma Republican said if no progress is made on the issue by Friday, he will step in and say, ""This needs to occur so that regardless of the outcome of the election, whichever way that it goes, people can be ready for that actual task.""
Lankford's comment comes as Biden and his senior advisers are not yet receiving the President's Daily Brief, the highly classified intelligence briefings about pressing national security issues that their soon-to-be predecessor has been offered daily.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Monday that Biden's lack of access stems from the election being not yet ascertained by the General Services Administration -- a clear indication that the Biden transition team is not getting the same briefings that presidents-elect typically receive.
It remains unclear whether the race needs to be ascertained before the President-elect can legally receive the briefings. Biden has said that the daily briefings ""would be useful, but it's not necessary.""
Lankford on Wednesday also referenced the abbreviated 2000 transition, which a bipartisan 9/11 report said contributed to a lack of security preparedness ahead of the 9/11 terror attacks.
""There's nothing wrong with Vice President Biden getting the briefings to be able to prepare himself and so that he can be ready -- the President's already getting those,"" Lankford said, adding that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a Democratic senator from California, also has the appropriate clearances to begin receiving briefings because she serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, also called for Biden to receive the briefings.
""As has been done in every other transition, the President should order that Biden and his team receive the PDB, as has been done in the past, even during the contested election of 2000,"" Warner said Wednesday. ""It's simply irresponsible to withhold this in these uncertain times.""
Like most of his Republican colleagues, Lankford did not go so far as to acknowledge that Biden is the president-elect after every major news organization projected his victory on Saturday.
Lankford defended the President's many legal disputes, saying the best thing right now is for Trump to be able to go through the legal process and ""get real answers"" before the Electoral College casts ballots in December.
There is no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in this election.
In the meantime, Lankford said, ""Joe Biden can continue to be able to function and say, 'I'm the president-elect,' and great if you want to say that, go do it, and to be able to do your preparation work. The President can say, 'Not so fast. I've got questions to answer.' Great, go ask them.""
Lankford implied that if the President is not able to follow through with its legal proceedings, it might stoke conspiracies among Trump supporters.
But judges have quickly dismissed cases that attempt to raise the possibility of voting irregularities, while elections experts make clear Biden's margin of victory is too wide for court cases to reverse and that existing court cases deal with too few votes, if any, to matter.
Asked about concerns at the Pentagon after Defense Secretary Mark Esper's firing on Monday and other moves by the administration that put a peaceful transfer of power into question, Lankford replied, ""I can assure you, there will be a peaceful transition of power in the United States.""
Lankford downplayed the significance of Esper's firing within days of the election, saying it was ""obviously long-planned"" and not just from a ""single petty event from months ago.""
He said, though, that he personally would not have made that change ""with the next two months"" -- seeming to refer to the two-month period until the inauguration -- again without fully acknowledging Biden as President-elect.
""It was a clear signal with preparation behind the scenes for a good transition at the Pentagon,"" Lankford said.

"Democrats create “Donald Trump Watch” website containing home addresses of Trump donors for Antifa, BLM to target","(Natural News) Left-wingers are once again showing their unique brand of love and tolerance for the opposition by launching a new website that doxes everyone in the country who contributed money to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, sharing their home addresses online.
Known as “Donald Trump Watch,” the site features an unsightly image of Trump grimacing alongside the words, “Americans that Give Money to Support a Racist.” Below it, users can search by zip code or street address to see who near them has ever donated money to Trump.
After plugging in an address or zip code, users are presented with a clickable map full of pins and addresses of Trump supporters in the area who supported a “racist” with their cash donations.
The top of the site features a quote from Voltaire that insinuates Trump is a dictator akin to Adolph Hitler:
“Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.”
Since the Donald Trump Watch site draws from publicly available information compiled by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), it is not technically illegal (as far as we know). However, it does tee-up Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Antifa to easily target Trump supporters for organized “protests.”
Why are the communist Chinese encouraging BLM, Antifa to commit violence against Trump supporters?
While claiming to be a privately owned entity not connected to any government agency, a little digging reveals that Donald Trump Watch is actually run by a company tied to the communist Chinese regime.
Dynadot LLC, the registered company associated with the site, is based out of San Mateo, Calif., but also has two offices in China – one in Zhenzhou and another in Beijing. Dynadot also apparently has an office in Toronto.
“Dynadot is a privately held ICANN accredited domain name registrar and web hosting company founded by software engineer Todd Han in 2002,” claims Wikipedia.
“Dynadot’s headquarters is established in San Mateo, California, with offices in Zhengzhou and Beijing, China, as well as Toronto, Canada.”
The group behind Dynadot is called Public Service Media Group, Inc., a corporation based out of Delaware where Joe Biden is from. It has three one-star reviews on Spokeo, one of which reads as follows:
“This company … is terrible, real scum lowlifes! They have a website where they publish all President Trump supporters / donors. So it makes it easier to be harassed by the terrorist group known as Antifa, which how they are still walking around beating up helpless people is beyond me!”
Another reviewer claims to be in pursuit of the owner of Public Service Media Group in order to file a lawsuit.
“He / she is responsible for a website called ‘Racism Watch’ that publishes names and addresses of individuals who make monetary donations to the Donald J. Trump campaign,” along with an email where information can be sent.
As far as we can tell, none of the major social media platforms have censored their users from sharing the link to Donald Trump Watch, despite the fact that it encourages people who hate Trump to harass and even harm his supporters and donors.
NBC News‘ Brandy Zadrozny would be proud, seeing as how she gets paid by her employer to do much the same, digging up information about Trump supporters in order to put them in the crosshairs of Antifa and BLM.
“The list isn’t going to tell anyone anything that the giant Trump flag outside my house isn’t already telling them,” wrote one commenter at The Gateway Pundit.
“But this is called terrorism, doxing people is a threat against people and their families in order to intimidate them into changing their behavior so that the terrorists can achieve a political objective. Antifa and all their allies need to be charged as terrorists.”

The non-stop effort to take down Trump and America,"(Natural News) On November 17, 2016, a meeting that may turn out to have been one of the most pivotal in American history took place at Trump Tower in New York City. On that day, nine days after the tumultuous 2016 presidential election, Admiral Michael S. Rogers met secretly with President-elect Donald Trump. It was a meeting that set off Deep State alarms, and those alarm bells instantly started echoing throughout the controlled Deep State media empire.
(Article by William F. Jasper republished from TheNewAmerican.com)
Why the intense anxiety? As director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Admiral Rogers was then also chief of the Central Security Service (CSS) and commander of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). He had previously served as the director for intelligence for both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. Pacific Command, as well as commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet and commander of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command. In other words, he was the top dog in the world of signals intelligence (SIGINT) and held the keys to the kingdom of America’s powerful surveillance-state apparatus.
What was Admiral Rogers doing at Trump Tower? According to globalist Deep State media assets, such as the Washington Post, NPR, and the New York Times, he was ingratiating himself to Donald Trump, hoping to get a job in the new administration as director of national intelligence (DNI), a position then held by Obama appointee James Clapper. The admiral’s detractors claim that he was about to be fired by President Obama for NSA intelligence failures and for his “aloof” leadership style. But according to Rogers’ defenders, the admiral’s journey to New York was a daring mission to warn the incoming president about a treasonous coup plot involving top members of the Obama administration and key leaders in the other intelligence agencies. And the media efforts to denigrate Rogers’ reputation were aimed precisely at publicly undermining his credibility and the warning he was delivering.
The extraordinary events of the past four years support the position of Admiral Rogers’ advocates, not his attackers. We all have witnessed, in real time, an unprecedented and ongoing coup effort in which high-level officials within the Trump administration, together with members of Congress, former government officials, media organizations, major think tanks, tax-exempt foundations, labor unions, and militant street mobs have carried out a coordinated and relentless campaign of disruption, subversion, insurrection, sabotage, and “resistance” to cripple and topple President Donald J. Trump. During that time, a continuous stream of revelations — through leaks, whistleblowers, inspector general reports, court rulings, congressional investigations, and Department of Justice investigations — has provided crucial witness testimony and documentary evidence to connect many of the dots.
Some of these crucial disclosures have only come to light in the final weeks leading up to the November 2020 elections. It has taken that long — the entire (first) term of the Trump presidency — to pry loose the damning evidence of criminality and treachery behind, for instance, the infamous (and phony) “Steele dossier”; the illegal FISA court warrants obtained for Spygate; the sham “Trump-Russia collusion” charge; the vicious FBI/DOJ/Mueller railroading of General Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Roger Stone, and Paul Manafort; the real evidence of Hillary Clinton-Russia collusion; the FBI/DOJ/Mueller collusion with Hillary Clinton, Fusion GPS, and Crowdstrike — and much, much more.
The Empire Strikes Back
The Trump Tower rendezvous between the president-elect and the NSA chief, understandably, caused a panic attack among the Deep State coup plotters. Although the actual content of the conversation between Trump and Rogers has not been publicly revealed, all indications are that the admiral spilled some pretty big beans. On the same day of that meeting, having apparently been apprised by Rogers that they were being spied upon, the Trump Transition Team surprised everyone with the abrupt announcement that they were immediately moving all transition activity to Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump then had a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, constructed at Trump Tower to prevent hostile surveillance — from enemies both foreign and domestic. On November 19, 2016, two days after that historic Trump-Rogers meeting, the attacks on Admiral Rogers began. Naturally, the Deep State conspirators chose the Washington Post, their longtime favorite disinformation spigot, to lead the smear campaign. The Post article, entitled “Pentagon and intelligence community chiefs have urged Obama to remove the head of the NSA,” stated, “The heads of the Pentagon and the nation’s intelligence community have recommended to President Obama that the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, be removed.”
“The recommendation, delivered to the White House last month,” the story continued, “was made by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to several U.S. officials familiar with the matter.” Typical of media hatchet jobs, the article was replete with alleged negative statements and allegations by anonymous “senior officials.”
Although it is dangerous to believe anything carried in that lie factory, it turns out the Post was correct in stating that top Department of Defense and intelligence community officials were urging President Obama to fire Admiral Rogers even before his trip to Trump Tower. Why? Well, as we subsequently learned, Rogers had been throwing sand into the gears of the coup plotters for the past year, challenging and thwarting their illegal activities. It appears that for months prior to the Trump Tower meeting, Rogers had been playing a cat-and-mouse game with the Obama administration and its lackeys in the “Intelligence Community.” Defense Secretary Ashton “Ash” Carter, who is also a director of the globalist-minded Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, took the lead in calling for his ouster. However, apparently it was Department of Justice National Security Division (DOJ-NSD) head John P. Carlin who had been assigned the job of deep-sixing the troublesome admiral.
Jeff Carlson, who writes for the Epoch Times and has posted some of the most detailed and perceptive articles on the coup intrigue, wrote that “Carlin was setting up Rogers as the scapegoat” for the very crimes Rogers was trying to stop and expose. Rogers had gone to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to report violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the Obama administration and members of the intelligence community. Section 702 of FISA is aimed at protecting Americans against warrantless search and seizure. Under Section 702, the NSA “may not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States.” Among additional prohibitions, it “may not intentionally target a U.S. person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.”
Carlin was the official at DOJ responsible for ensuring that the administration abided by FISA restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. However, he had covered for the Obama administration’s routine violation of those restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. Admiral Rogers became aware of the serious nature and extent of FISA violations and ordered the NSA’s Office of Compliance to “do a fundamental baseline review of compliance associated with 702.” Among the findings of the review was that the FBI, which had access to NSA intercepts, was illegally sharing this FISA data on individuals with private contractors. This criminal use of private contractors was one of a number of violations condemned by FISC presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer in her stinging rebuke of the FBI in her April 26, 2017 ruling. This FBI abuse apparently had been brought to her attention by Admiral Rogers, who had already shut down all FBI contractor access a year before, in April 2016. Although Judge Collyer’s ruling redacts the names of the contractors, various analysts have reasonably suggested from clues in the text, timelines, and related data that at least some of the contractors cited are very likely entities associated with Hillary Clinton’s campaign, such as Fusion GPS and Crowdstrike.
Additionally, the NSA compliance review found numerous “About Query” violations. “Rogers shut down all ‘about query’ activity on Oct. 21, 2016,” reported Jeff Carlson in the Epoch Times on December 20, 2019. “‘About queries’ are particularly worrisome,” Carlson noted, “since they occur when the target is neither the sender nor the recipient of the collected communication; rather, the target’s ‘query,’ such as an email address, is being passed between two other communicants.”
Admiral Rogers and the FISA court also dinged the FBI and DOJ for failure to comply with Standard Minimization Procedures. The website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) describes “minimization” as “a detailed set of procedures designed to minimize the acquisition, retention, use and dissemination of U.S. person information acquired under Section 702.”
Subsequent revelations highlighted another egregious intelligence abuse, the illegal “unmasking” of individuals in NSA data by Obama officials. And as Representative Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), then chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said, these violations had “nothing to do” with Russia or national security matters. They were all about weaponizing and politicizing the intelligence functions.
Representative Nunes was one of many who came to Admiral Rogers’ defense when he was attacked by Carter, Clapper, and the Washington Post. Nunes’ defense of Rogers, as well as his pit-bull tenacity in exposing the criminal deeds of the coup plotters, soon earned him even more vicious attacks in the Deep State-aligned press than had been dished out to the NSA chief.
Taking Out His Teammates
For much the same reasons that they wanted to get rid of Admiral Rogers, the Deep State’s globalist elites wanted to make sure that General Michael Flynn would not survive as President Trump’s national security advisor. General Flynn had been director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under President Obama. However, he had been forced out, into early retirement, in 2014 by Clapper and Obama. He shares many of the traits of Admiral Rogers that make the insiders of the Obama-Biden-Clinton-Pelosi circles of power (and those above them) very nervous. He knows too much and can’t be depended on to go along with their subversion of the Constitution and the rule of law. Thus, he was forced to resign, by a campaign of lies and innuendo, on February 13, 2017, only 24 days after having been sworn in.
However, General Flynn’s long ordeal was just beginning. The coup plotters were determined to make an example of him, to crush him, to send him to prison. They very nearly succeeded. Four years later, the general’s tribulation is still not over. The Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr filed a motion on May 7, 2020 to dismiss with prejudice the charges against Flynn. The DOJ motion noted that Flynn’s questioning “was untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation.” However, federal district judge Emmet G. Sullivan has refused to dismiss the case and continues to fight the dismissal with extraordinary measures.
The pretext for the vendetta against General Flynn is the charge that he lied about the content and nature of his communications with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. This was all part and parcel of the hoax aimed at convincing the American public that Donald Trump and other members of his team were colluding with and/or were compromised by Russia and Vladimir Putin. The congressional investigations found no evidence to substantiate these charges. Neither did the much-ballyhooed two-year “Russia probe” by Office of Special Counsel (OSC) Robert Mueller. Nor did any of the media sleuths who had been trumpeting the “Russia, Russia, Russia” theme for four years.
Many stakes have been driven into the heart of the “Russia collusion” corpse, but the latest one delivered by FBI agent William Barnett this past September may finally do the job. Barnett, who was the FBI’s lead agent on the Flynn case, has described the investigation and prosecution of Flynn as an operation to “get Trump.” Barnett says he and other FBI and CIA investigators and analysts recognized early on that the probe was an “exercise in futility” and that the prosecutors were “groping” to find a crime. According to Barnett, top Mueller team prosecutors such as Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Weissmann were “obsessed” with finding a Trump-Russia connection and used overly aggressive tactics to obtain what they wanted. He says he had to intervene multiple times during interviews with Flynn and others due to misleading questions by Mueller team members.
FBI Director James Comey, Special Counsel Robert Mueller (a former FBI director), and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates had stacked the FBI/DOJ/OSC investigations with virulently partisan, anti-Trump staffers, as the notorious e-mail and text messages of FBI Agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page show.
Real Collusion: Russia-Hillary
On October 3, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified notes of former CIA Director John Brennan. It was an explosive revelation, but (surprise!) none of the “mainstream” media seemed to show the slightest interest. What did the notes reveal? They showed that Brennan had briefed former President Obama on July 26, 2016 concerning Hillary Clinton’s alleged “plan” to smear then-candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Russia as “a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.”
Brennan’s handwritten notes state:
We’re getting additional insight into Russian activities from [REDACTED]. . . CITE [summarizing] alleged approved by Hillary Clinton a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.
On July 31, 2016, five days after Brennan’s briefing of Obama on the Clinton scheme, Comey’s FBI opened its bogus “investigation” of the Trump campaign and its alleged ties to Russia.
Consider the enormity of this: The Steele dossier, as it has now been incontestably shown, was put together by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, with the assistance of Russian intelligence. It was then used by not only Hillary Clinton but also her co-conspirators Barack Obama, James Comey, James Clapper, Nancy Pelosi, Representative Adam Schiff, the Washington Post,the New York Times,CNN, CBS, and all the rest of the Deep State cabal to vilify Trump, precisely as directed in the Clinton scheme outlined in Brennan’s briefing to President Obama. So, it is Hillary Clinton who is the Russia colluder.
Then Clinton and her campaign lawyer Marc Elias repeatedly lied and denied any connection to the obscene “pee dossier” — until documentary evidence forced them to admit that they had financed it. Then Hil-lary switched her tune and even defended funding the dossier. It was just legit “opposition research,” she told ABC News.
Audacious it certainly was, especially since the Clinton-Russia ties go far deeper than her collusion with Russian intelligence to produce the aforementioned “Steele dossier.” It was/is Hillary Clinton (and her husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, and their Clinton Foundation), not Donald Trump, that has all the ties to Putin and Russia. As we have reported in The New American many times over the years, Hillary Clinton had notoriously concluded a number of deals with Putin’s regime that materially aided Russia’s military-industrial-techological advancement, while simultaneously striking serious blows to America’s national security. Along these lines we could mention, for example, the Uranium One deal that gave Russia a controlling interest in our American uranium production, and the technology transfers that have helped build Skolkovo, Russia’s hi-tech Silicon Valley.
Of course, that was already known by the Deep Staters who were, nevertheless, pushing the Trump-Russia theme with a vengeance.
Those Spreading the Lies
Thus far in this article we have focused primarily on the Deep State’s coup efforts through the operations of its captive intelligence agencies. This is not to suggest that all or even most of the men and women who serve in the FBI, CIA, DIA, and other intelligence-community agencies are parties to this treachery. Indeed, it is due to leaks and testimony from many brave and patriotic employees who have risked their careers, reputations, pensions — and even their lives — to expose the crimes and treason of the political hacks who are their bosses, that we know about the fraud and lies.
The intelligence community wields enormous power, but it is only one facet of the larger Deep State cabal that has been attacking the Trump administration — and America — from every angle and on every level.
Working closely in tandem with the Deep State intelligence community is the controlled establishment media, whose indispensable role we have highlighted in an article on page 16. Together with the Big Tech social-media giants and search engines — Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Reddit, Yahoo, Microsoft, Bing, etc. — they are transforming American society ever more rapidly to resemble the totalitarian system of Communist China. Not only are they dispensing statist prop-aganda that more and more mimics the Chinese Communist Party line, but in true Orwellian fashion they are blatantly punishing “thought crime” with censorship, demonetization, deplatforming, bullying, doxing, and label-lynching.
Deep State operatives within the intelligence community and throughout the federal bureaucracy also collude with the anti-Trump/anti-American media to produce a steady deluge of strategically timed leaks, many of which involve classified material, and all of which are calculated to disrupt and cripple the operations of government. Like the Antifa street thugs, they may as well adopt the revolutionary slogan, “Make America Ungovernable!”
Speaking of Antifa, we should mention here the important role they and their comrades in Black Lives Matter are playing in the orchestrated coup effort. Their job is to provide pressure from below while Deep State operatives in government and the media provide pressure from above. The BLM/Antifa rioters would have amounted to nothing except for: 1) the massive funding they have received from George Soros and other globalists; 2) the massive media promotion and propaganda they have enjoyed; 3) the enormous boost they have received from radical politicians and particularly from mayors and prosecutors (many of whom are Soros-funded) who refuse to prosecute the rioters; and 4) the crucial leadership of hard-core Marxist-Leninists of the Revolutionary Communist Party, the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and other revolutionary groups. But, naturally, these things are never mentioned by the controlled media, which would have us believe the lie that the BLM/Antifa mobs are authentic, grassroots organizations.
Still another important element of the ongoing coup effort is the campaign to expand and empower the United Nations and all of its programs. President Trump not only has initiated action to withdraw the United States from the disastrous UN Climate Accord, but also has terminated U.S. membership in UNESCO, WHO, and the UN Arms Trade Treaty, which is a thinly disguised attack on the Second Amendment. Obviously, these and other Trumpian attacks on the globalists’ New World Order could not be allowed to stand. Then we saw the convenient unleashing of the COVID-19 “pandemic” upon the world by Communist China to wreck the rebounding U.S. economy, while pro-Beijing globalists such as Bill Gates, George Soros, and their confreres at the Council on Foreign Relations and World Economic Forum have cheered the moves by Western governments to adopt Chinese-style totalitarianism and “global health governance.”
As we go to press (on November 5) the official results of the election are still up in the air, though it is obvious that operatives of the Deep State have been active at all levels, and using all illegal means at their disposal, to steal votes from President Trump and throw the count to Joe Biden. As the decision over who won the White House gets thrown to the courts, we can expect that the BLM/Antifa mobs will also be unleashed into the streets. There also are crucial U.S. Senate and House races that remain unresolved. The outcomes of these races will hugely impact our nation, not the least of matters being whether or not we will see a packing of the Supreme Court, as many leading Democrats are calling for.

‘Livid’ Limbaugh confident ‘Trump is going to win this’,"(Natural News) With no official winner declared in the 2020 presidential race, talk-radio star Rush Limbaugh said President Trump would, in fact, win the election when the final results are accurately sorted out.
(Article by Joe Kovacs republished from WND.com)
“Trump is going to win this,” Limbaugh said confidently on his national broadcast Wednesday. “We did, we have, we’ve reelected Trump. … This doesn’t mean that I’m not livid, and it doesn’t mean that I’m not ticked off and mad like all the rest of you are, because I am.”
“Donald Trump was not repudiated last night. Donald Trump was reelected last night. Time will show us this.”
Limbaugh, a staunch supporter of Trump and fellow resident of Palm Beach, Florida, said, “We were winning big last night. … That’s why they stopped the counting.”
“When they stopped counting, it means they’re looking for Democrat votes. It means they don’t have Democrat votes. It means they gotta go find ’em. We are wise to their ways now.”
“Why is it that every state that is not a swing state run by Democrats can keep their act together on Election Night?” he asked rhetorically.
“The Democrats, I can’t tell you how depressed they are today that Trump was not repudiated,” he continued. “That’s what they really wanted to happen.”
He said the Democratic mantra of “Count every ballot” is not legitimate.
“‘We’re not going to count every ballot. We’re going to count every legitimate vote. It’s a big difference. … We’re gonna win playing by the rules, despite the fact the other side does not.”
Limbaugh also suggested Fox News called the state of Arizona too early and mistakenly for Joe Biden as personal payback by the network after Trump had publicly criticized the network on “Fox and Friends” this week.
“It’s personal. It was absolutely personal. But Trump’s gonna end up winning Arizona. … I think he already has. It’s just a matter of this playing out.”
“That Arizona call, the investigation of that … I think it’s gonna reveal some fascinating things that are going on in the bowels of the decision desk at the Fox News Channel.”
He called the outcome of huge support for the president “a devastating night” for Democrats.
“It was so huge the Democrats never saw it coming,” he noted. “These people are vindictive. They are single-mindedly hateful … They have been waiting, and they have been dreaming, they have been hoping, they have been planning on, they have been counting on you and every other American telling Donald Trump to go to hell yesterday — and that didn’t happen. … They literally thought Trump was going to be sent packing.”
Limbaugh said he talked with White House officials who say anywhere from two-thirds to 70 percent of Arizona votes are coming to the president, meaning that state could be counted in Trump’s favor.
Limbaugh urged his listeners: “The American way of life is going to be preserved. Keep the faith. The best days of our country are still ahead of us.”
“We want love and peace in our lives. We want our lives to be pleasant.”

Video: Deranged Olbermann calls for coup against President Trump,"(Natural News) In a venom filled online rant, Keith Olbermann called for President Trump to be dragged out of the White House immediately in handcuffs.
(Article by swatson republished from Summit.news)
“TRUMP HAS LOST HIS MIND AND MUST BE REMOVED, TONIGHT,” Olbermann tweeted, along with the video of him ranting on his online program literally titled Olbermann vs Trump.
“The coup attempt, we can survive. A mentally incompetent president, we may not. Instead, he will stay, and when he concedes he will simultaneously begin a campaign for 2024.” Olbermann stated.
Olbermann called Trump “President Karen” and a “lame duck president.”
TRUMP MUST BE REMOVED AND ARRESTED, TONIGHT. Gripped by a paranoid delusion, threatening the nation's safety, this can't wait any longer. It won't happen; in fact he'll probably concede and instantly announce he's running in '24.

Here is the full 10 minute mental breakdown, for those who can stomach it:
President Trump vowed last night to take the matter of election theft to the highest court in the land, noting “We think there’ll be a lot of litigation, because we cannot have an election stolen like this.”
Once a respected newsreader who espoused nuanced positions including opposition to illegal invasions in the Middle East, Olbermann is now completely unhinged, engaging in endless ‘orange man bad’ rants.
Last month Olbermann said Trump should be executed over the handling of the coronavirus:

According to Schwarz, who also writes for The New York Times, The Atlantic and other far-left media outlets, “at least” 75 percent of those who work in the mainstream media – “including me,” he tweeted – have “a side job destroying Trump ballots.”
“When you love something as much as we love destroying Trump ballots, you make the time,” he tweeted back on Nov. 1, 2016.
Schwarz added in a series of other tweets the same day that destroying Trump ballots is “not a felony.” He also added that “the constitution says you can destroy trump ballots,” presumably joking – but how does one really tell anymore?
In a recent article he wrote entitled, “The Election Isn’t Over Until Trump’s Gone,” Schwarz suggested that people who hate Trump need to initiate “street fights” in the event that Trump wins reelection on Nov. 3.
Schwarz also believes that illegal aliens should not only be allowed to vote, but to do so multiple times until Democrat candidates are able to “win.”
A self-described alum of filmmaker Michael Moore’s Dog Eat Dog films, as well as “a research producer for Moore’s Capitalism: A Love Story,” Schwarz is hellbent on removing Trump from office through any means possible.
After being accused of visiting a voting site during the 2016 election “to fake IDs & assist in ferrying illegals from polling station to polling station,” Schwarz responded unashamedly with:
“let’s not rest on our laurels though, everyone’s needed in Wisconsin to destroy Trump ballots during the recount.”

Schwarz supports militant Antifa-backed Transition Integrity Project
Should Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not win in a landslide on Nov. 3, Schwarz’s allies over at the Transition Integrity Project (TIP) are planning to unleash hell across America.
The so-called “Fight Back Table” has indicated plans to initiate “mass public unrest” in the event that Trump wins, and Schwarz wants to take it all a step further with mass violence.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly taken notice of Schwarz’s statements and behavior, having launched an investigation into a positive reaction that Schwarz had to a tweet by Huffington Post editor Nick Baumann that reads:
“i love my job working at a voting site in washington dc destroying trump ballots.”
After Baumann came out to state that he was joking, Schwarz chimed in and stated that he:
“want[ed] to emphasize to the FBI that, while @nickbaumann was joking, I was completely serious. I am not kidding.”
Schwarz further bragged that he has supposedly “destroy[ed] 1000s of ballots,” further expressing confusion that the FBI “is investigating Nick for jokes when I’m the one who destroyed 1000s of ballots.”
Since “lots more people want [Trump] to be president” than Biden or anyone else – Schwarz’s words, not ours – Schwarz has made it his personal mission to “destroy the ballots” to try to keep Trump out of office.
Schwarz now claims that all of these tweets were mere jokes, despite the incredible volume of them that would suggest otherwise. He apparently thinks he is quite the funny guy who compensates for his lack of wit by suggesting that he commits election fraud for fun.
“Still waiting on your piece debunking police shooting stats,” wrote one Twitter user trying to get Schwarz’s attention concerning a promise he apparently made in an earlier article about police violence.
“It never materialize[d]. I guess you’re busy with other stuff.”

State Department is preventing Biden from accessing messages from foreign leaders,"Washington (CNN)A stack of messages from foreign leaders to President-elect Joe Biden are sitting at the State Department but the Trump administration is preventing him from accessing them, according to State Department officials familiar with the messages.
Traditionally, the State Department supports all communications for the President-elect, which is why many countries began sending messages to State over the weekend. But with Biden prohibited from accessing State Department resources by the Trump administration, because President Donald Trump refuses to accept Biden's victory, dozens of incoming messages have not been received.
Biden's team is contacting foreign governments on their own and he has held numerous calls with leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel and Canada's Justin Trudeau. But they are operating without the logistical and translation support that the State Department operations center provides.
""They would prefer to be using the State Department resources,"" said a source familiar with the situation, who noted that the Biden team is having to deal with the unexpected challenge of facilitating these calls.
Not only is Biden being blocked by the State Department from receiving messages and assistance facilitating and from preparing for calls, on Tuesday Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to acknowledge Biden's victory, saying that ""there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" igniting a furor and roiling diplomats.
Biden is also being blocked from getting the same intelligence briefings as the President, known as the President's Daily Brief, and should the Trump administration continue to block a typical transition close to Inauguration Day on January 20, there are concerns Biden's administration will be playing catch-up the day he takes office.
Foreign leaders have begun to figure out that State cannot get them in touch with the President-elect and their teams have reached out to former Obama-era diplomats for their assistance on how to send congratulatory messages to Biden's team, sources told CNN. Some foreign governments feel they are navigating an unfamiliar maze, foreign diplomats have told CNN.
""It was helpful to have State ops place the calls and to provide translation services, and we were grateful for the cooperation from the Bush administration for making that happen,"" said Denis McDonough, who served in the Obama administration and worked with Obama during the transition.
The calls taking place right now are not highly sensitive, and even during a well-oiled transition period they are not normally conducted on secure lines, multiple sources explained.
""These calls in the past have been handled on open lines. They are congratulatory calls,"" McDonough said, adding that both sides are providing readouts, which is consistent with protocol.
Barack Obama often made these calls to foreign leaders on his cell phone when he was President-elect, explained a State Department official who worked on setting up those calls at the time. But they all went through the operations center, which meant there is a government record of the calls he made.
Career officials at the State Department are ready to help the Biden team when the time comes.
""The agencies implemented the law faithfully prior to the election. The materials are ready, the offices are ready, everything is ready; they are waiting for the green light,"" said David Marchick, the director of the Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service.
Operating without State Department support right now, the Biden team -- made up of many experienced former government officials -- has sent out readouts of all of the calls, which help with record keeping. They are making an effort to formalize the process and will use State Department resources when they are available, said a source familiar with the unfolding situation.
This is a stark contrast with the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. At the time, President-elect Trump opted not to use State Department resources. Instead, he made his calls out of Trump Tower and resisted using the government support and coordination system, which meant that translators and staff sat waiting without any work while Trump made calls on his own, a State Department official told CNN at the time.
At any other point since Biden left the White House, he would have been able to call into the State Department operations center to place a call to a foreign leader, State Department officials told CNN. Former presidents and vice presidents are allowed to use the resource whenever they wish. But now, as he is President-elect, Biden is being prevented from using that facility by the Trump administration.

The White House declined to comment on Jack specifically, but said in a statement that positive cases are ""taken seriously.""
""Contact tracing has been conducted by the White House Medical Unit consistent with CDC guidelines to stop further transmission. Appropriate notifications and recommendations have been made,"" the statement said.
Jack attended the election night party held indoors over a week ago. The news was first reported by The New York Times.

White House coronavirus task force warns of 'accelerating community spread',"(CNN)The White House coronavirus task force is again alerting states of ""accelerating"" coronavirus spread as cases and hospitalizations rapidly rise across the country with few signs of stabilizing. It strongly recommends increased testing in its weekly reports to states.
""There is continued, accelerating community spread across the top half of the country, where temperatures have cooled and Americans have moved indoors,"" reports dated November 8 and distributed to states Tuesday evening said.
The task force, which warned of ""significant deterioration in the Sunbelt"" in last week's set of reports, said that that deterioration has only continued in the past week, ""leading to the most diffuse spread experienced to date.""
The weekly task force reports continue to provide an unvarnished, unfiltered look at the reality of each state's current situation, which comes as President Donald Trump and task force leader Vice President Mike Pence have declined to address the worsening pandemic publicly in weeks. The White House has repeatedly declined to make all of the reports publicly accessible.
In recommendations to several states, the task force called for an expansion of testing, particularly to target asymptomatic cases.
""The silent community spread that precedes and continues throughout surges can only be identified and interrupted through proactive and increased testing and surveillance,"" reports for multiple states said, suggesting expanding point-of-care antigen tests.
The reports said: ""Proactive testing must be part of the mitigation efforts, inclusive of mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and immediate isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine.""
A report for New Mexico, where the task force said there is ""full and unrelenting community spread,"" noted that requiring testing only for individuals experiencing Covid-19 symptoms ""is preventing adequate testing and control of the pandemic.""
North Dakota remains the state with the highest number of new cases per 100,000 population, followed by South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana, Illinois, Utah and Minnesota in the top 10.
Vermont remains the state with the lowest number of cases and is one of only two states, including Hawaii, in the task force-defined ""yellow zone"" for new cases, meaning between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 population. But Vermont was still warned in its report that there is ""cause for concern given the continued uptick in the state"" coinciding with colder weather.
The report for Ohio described ""vast and unmitigated community spread"" with ""no evidence of improvement.""
In Delaware, where cases are disproportionately affecting young adults between 20 and 35 years of age, the task force said, ""We share the assessment of Delaware leaders that the Covid epidemic is likely to worsen.""
Some state reports reiterated the need for communication of ""basic actions"" residents should take.
""Do not gather without a mask with individuals living outside of your household,"" ""Always wear a mask in public places,"" ""Stop gatherings beyond immediate household until cases and test positivity are in the yellow zone"" and ""Get your flu shot,"" the reports warned.
And, as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, one state's report stressed the need for indoor mask usage.
""We need to protect those we are thankful for in our families and communities. Ensure indoor masking around vulnerable family members during any gatherings due to the significant amount of virus circulating and the high rate of asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections among family and community members,"" the report said.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/coronavirus-task-force-state-reports/index.html,Betsy Klein,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:22:00 GMT",CNN,1
Alarm grows over Trump's 'dictator moves' as he denies election defeat,"(CNN)President Donald Trump's administration is taking on the characteristics of a tottering regime -- with its loyalty tests, destabilizing attacks on the military chain of command, a deepening bunker mentality and increasingly delusional claims of political victory.
In response, a visibly confident President-elect Joe Biden is going out of his way to project calm amid the deepening chaos, even as Trump and senior Republicans still refuse to acknowledge the President's defeat in a stunning break with America's democratic traditions.
Biden is taking calls with leaders of the country's top allies, which reflects the inevitability of his ascent to power. While the President is staying behind closed doors, tweeting in wild block capital letters and unleashing a purge of the Pentagon's civilian leadership, Biden is on camera. The President-elect is reassuring the American people with a composure granted by an election win that Trump's threadbare legal cases baselessly alleging massive voter fraud have little chance of overturning the will of the voters.
The President-elect on Tuesday consciously avoided escalating a confrontation with Trump, who is withholding the access and funding that incoming presidents normally rely on to stand up their administrations. But while Trump will remain President until January 20, an unmistakable symbolic transfer of authority is taking place despite Trump's efforts to deny his successor legitimacy.
""We don't see anything that's slowing us down, quite frankly,"" Biden said.
The President-elect has already crossed the necessary threshold of 270 electoral votes, according to projections from CNN and other major news outlets and has a chance of matching Trump's 2016 total of 306 electoral votes given his leads in Georgia and Arizona.
And more false accusations and conspiracy theories touted by Trump supporters to claim electoral fraud are dissolving, a day after Attorney General William Barr stepped into the political fray to advise prosecutors to probe major fraud.
The Department of Homeland Security meanwhile pushed back on rumors that ballots were cast on behalf of dead people.
But the Trump team only dug itself deeper into a bizarre parallel universe -- one where the President has already secured a second term -- consistent with the embrace of misinformation and alternative facts that has characterized the last four years.
The administration's defiance took an even more ridiculous twist on Tuesday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo showed his loyalty to a leader who shows no sign of working on key issues -- including a pandemic that has now landed more Americans in hospitals than ever before.
""There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" Pompeo said. Asked whether Trump's refusal to concede undercut traditional US critiques of corrupt elections abroad, Pompeo rounded on a reporter: ""That's ridiculous. And you know it's ridiculous, and you asked it because it's ridiculous."" As recently as Monday, Pompeo issued a statement warning of electoral issues in Myanmar, which was long ruled by the military and has endured a difficult transition to semi-democracy where dissidents once looked at the US as a lodestar.
In Wilmington, Delaware, the President-elect pointedly refused to pour fuel on the fire, dismissing the idea that he needed to take legal action to release transition funds and making clear that he was confident that the process of assuming power would eventually work itself out.
He described Trump's behavior since Election Day as ""an embarrassment"" and after saying he was seeking to be tactful added: ""It will not help the President's legacy."" Asked whether Republicans would ever accept his victory, he said, ""They will, they will,"" and he suggested with a half-smile that GOP senators were ""mildly intimidated"" by the President.
Biden, who once had a reputation as a windy public speaker, is showing a new persona to the American people. He noticeably chose his words carefully on Tuesday, putting on a show of calm, as he experiences the transformation that often comes over victorious candidates as they begin to assume the weight of the presidency after winning elections.
Trump by contrast is tarnishing the instruments of American democracy by refusing to concede and leaving the country more vulnerable with revenge firings that threaten to weaken critical national security agencies.
After Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had put loyalty to the Constitution ahead of his duty to the President, three other senior Pentagon officials have been fired or resigned. They include the department's top policy official, James Anderson, who resigned and is being replaced by retired Brigadier General Anthony Tata, whose nomination for the post earlier this summer foundered after CNN's KFile reported his numerous past Islamophobic and offensive remarks.
Sources told Barbara Starr and CNN's Pentagon team that the dismissals might be motivated by pushback from Esper and his team against a withdrawal from Afghanistan that would be carried out before the required conditions on the ground were met, and other pending security issues.
""This is scary, it's very unsettling,"" one defense official told CNN. ""These are dictator moves.""
A disputed transfer of power could offer US adversaries an opening, especially if there is a belief abroad that there is disarray in the national security infrastructure. Trump may next turn his ire on CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Christopher Wray, CNN's Jake Tapper has reported. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on CNN International Tuesday that he feared the US was entering a dangerous period.
""I think (Trump) is going to be uniquely distracted from world events and national security,"" Murphy said. Former national security adviser John Bolton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Pompeo's comments on a Trump transition were ""delusional.""
""I think he has eviscerated his credibility internationally because I think there are very few people even in the US government who believe that is the case,"" Bolton said.
Despite Trump's claims that his second term is being stolen from him, the President's legal claim has so far made no headway in its efforts to claim massive fraud. The gambit looks increasingly like a political exercise as Trump struggles to come to terms with his defeat while Republican senators scared of the President's political base refuse to cross him, especially with two Georgia run-off elections scheduled for January that will decide control of their chamber.
Trump's already minuscule opportunity to change the course of the election is diminishing by the day. Biden is now more than 46,000 votes ahead in Pennsylvania, is up by 12,000 in Georgia and has a lead of 14,000 ballots in Arizona. It is not clear whether there are sufficient remaining votes left in the Grand Canyon state for the President to overtake the President-elect.
As the Trump campaign filed a new long-shot lawsuit in Michigan, which Biden won by nearly than 150,000 votes, its communications director Tim Murtaugh said, ""We do believe that ultimately President Trump will be declared the winner of this election.""
But Benjamin Ginsberg, a veteran Republican election lawyer, said that the Trump campaign ""was a long way from nowhere"" in its quest to overturn the outcome of the election.
""To win cases, they have to put enough results into play to change the outcome of the election in individual states and in none of the suits they have filed around the country are they anywhere close to doing that in any state,"" Ginsberg said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""
Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dug in Tuesday on his insistence that Trump was within his rights to pursue his complaints.
""I think we ought to quit all the hand-wringing and not act like this is extraordinary,"" the newly reelected Kentucky Republican said.
""We're going to get through this period and we'll swear in the winner on January the 20th, 2021, just like we have every four years since 1793.""
While many observers believe McConnell is playing a long political game — with the Georgia run-offs and the 2022 midterm congressional elections in mind, the silence of Republican senators is emboldening Trump's intransigence.
The world has already moved on
But while GOP lawmakers aren't willing to break with the President, many world leaders are moving to embrace Biden -- including a number of whom who saw themselves as ideological counterparts of the President.
Biden's campaign released statements on the President-elect's calls with the leaders of France, Germany and Ireland. Biden also spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose populist leanings made him a good fit with Trump. Johnson promised to work with Biden in a post-Covid-19 era.
Even Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who bonded with Trump over their common strongman tendencies, issued a public message congratulating Biden on his ""election success."" And Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- who has a close and controversial relationship with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner -- sent Biden a cable in which they conveyed congratulations on ""His Excellency's victory in the presidential elections.""
Biden said he had a simple message for all the world leaders: ""I am letting them know America is back.""

Republican senator says he will step in if Biden doesn't have access to intelligence briefings by Friday,"(CNN)Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford said Wednesday that he will intervene if the Trump administration has not allowed President-elect Joe Biden access to presidential daily intelligence briefings by the end of the week, one of the first rights of a presidential candidate after winning the election.
""There is no loss from him getting the briefings and to be able to do that,"" Lankford told radio station KRMG, noting that he sits on the Senate Oversight Committee and that he's already started engaging on this issue.
The Oklahoma Republican said if no progress is made on the issue by Friday, he will step in and say, ""This needs to occur so that regardless of the outcome of the election, whichever way that it goes, people can be ready for that actual task.""
Lankford's comment comes as Biden and his senior advisers are not yet receiving the President's Daily Brief, the highly classified intelligence briefings about pressing national security issues that their soon-to-be predecessor has been offered daily.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Monday that Biden's lack of access stems from the election being not yet ascertained by the General Services Administration -- a clear indication that the Biden transition team is not getting the same briefings that presidents-elect typically receive.
It remains unclear whether the race needs to be ascertained before the President-elect can legally receive the briefings. Biden has said that the daily briefings ""would be useful, but it's not necessary.""
Lankford on Wednesday also referenced the abbreviated 2000 transition, which a bipartisan 9/11 report said contributed to a lack of security preparedness ahead of the 9/11 terror attacks.
""There's nothing wrong with Vice President Biden getting the briefings to be able to prepare himself and so that he can be ready -- the President's already getting those,"" Lankford said, adding that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a Democratic senator from California, also has the appropriate clearances to begin receiving briefings because she serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, also called for Biden to receive the briefings.
""As has been done in every other transition, the President should order that Biden and his team receive the PDB, as has been done in the past, even during the contested election of 2000,"" Warner said Wednesday. ""It's simply irresponsible to withhold this in these uncertain times.""
Like most of his Republican colleagues, Lankford did not go so far as to acknowledge that Biden is the president-elect after every major news organization projected his victory on Saturday.
Lankford defended the President's many legal disputes, saying the best thing right now is for Trump to be able to go through the legal process and ""get real answers"" before the Electoral College casts ballots in December.
There is no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in this election.
In the meantime, Lankford said, ""Joe Biden can continue to be able to function and say, 'I'm the president-elect,' and great if you want to say that, go do it, and to be able to do your preparation work. The President can say, 'Not so fast. I've got questions to answer.' Great, go ask them.""
Lankford implied that if the President is not able to follow through with its legal proceedings, it might stoke conspiracies among Trump supporters.
But judges have quickly dismissed cases that attempt to raise the possibility of voting irregularities, while elections experts make clear Biden's margin of victory is too wide for court cases to reverse and that existing court cases deal with too few votes, if any, to matter.
Asked about concerns at the Pentagon after Defense Secretary Mark Esper's firing on Monday and other moves by the administration that put a peaceful transfer of power into question, Lankford replied, ""I can assure you, there will be a peaceful transition of power in the United States.""
Lankford downplayed the significance of Esper's firing within days of the election, saying it was ""obviously long-planned"" and not just from a ""single petty event from months ago.""
He said, though, that he personally would not have made that change ""with the next two months"" -- seeming to refer to the two-month period until the inauguration -- again without fully acknowledging Biden as President-elect.
""It was a clear signal with preparation behind the scenes for a good transition at the Pentagon,"" Lankford said.

"Democrats create “Donald Trump Watch” website containing home addresses of Trump donors for Antifa, BLM to target","(Natural News) Left-wingers are once again showing their unique brand of love and tolerance for the opposition by launching a new website that doxes everyone in the country who contributed money to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, sharing their home addresses online.
Known as “Donald Trump Watch,” the site features an unsightly image of Trump grimacing alongside the words, “Americans that Give Money to Support a Racist.” Below it, users can search by zip code or street address to see who near them has ever donated money to Trump.
After plugging in an address or zip code, users are presented with a clickable map full of pins and addresses of Trump supporters in the area who supported a “racist” with their cash donations.
The top of the site features a quote from Voltaire that insinuates Trump is a dictator akin to Adolph Hitler:
“Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.”
Since the Donald Trump Watch site draws from publicly available information compiled by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), it is not technically illegal (as far as we know). However, it does tee-up Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Antifa to easily target Trump supporters for organized “protests.”
Why are the communist Chinese encouraging BLM, Antifa to commit violence against Trump supporters?
While claiming to be a privately owned entity not connected to any government agency, a little digging reveals that Donald Trump Watch is actually run by a company tied to the communist Chinese regime.
Dynadot LLC, the registered company associated with the site, is based out of San Mateo, Calif., but also has two offices in China – one in Zhenzhou and another in Beijing. Dynadot also apparently has an office in Toronto.
“Dynadot is a privately held ICANN accredited domain name registrar and web hosting company founded by software engineer Todd Han in 2002,” claims Wikipedia.
“Dynadot’s headquarters is established in San Mateo, California, with offices in Zhengzhou and Beijing, China, as well as Toronto, Canada.”
The group behind Dynadot is called Public Service Media Group, Inc., a corporation based out of Delaware where Joe Biden is from. It has three one-star reviews on Spokeo, one of which reads as follows:
“This company … is terrible, real scum lowlifes! They have a website where they publish all President Trump supporters / donors. So it makes it easier to be harassed by the terrorist group known as Antifa, which how they are still walking around beating up helpless people is beyond me!”
Another reviewer claims to be in pursuit of the owner of Public Service Media Group in order to file a lawsuit.
“He / she is responsible for a website called ‘Racism Watch’ that publishes names and addresses of individuals who make monetary donations to the Donald J. Trump campaign,” along with an email where information can be sent.
As far as we can tell, none of the major social media platforms have censored their users from sharing the link to Donald Trump Watch, despite the fact that it encourages people who hate Trump to harass and even harm his supporters and donors.
NBC News‘ Brandy Zadrozny would be proud, seeing as how she gets paid by her employer to do much the same, digging up information about Trump supporters in order to put them in the crosshairs of Antifa and BLM.
“The list isn’t going to tell anyone anything that the giant Trump flag outside my house isn’t already telling them,” wrote one commenter at The Gateway Pundit.
“But this is called terrorism, doxing people is a threat against people and their families in order to intimidate them into changing their behavior so that the terrorists can achieve a political objective. Antifa and all their allies need to be charged as terrorists.”

The non-stop effort to take down Trump and America,"(Natural News) On November 17, 2016, a meeting that may turn out to have been one of the most pivotal in American history took place at Trump Tower in New York City. On that day, nine days after the tumultuous 2016 presidential election, Admiral Michael S. Rogers met secretly with President-elect Donald Trump. It was a meeting that set off Deep State alarms, and those alarm bells instantly started echoing throughout the controlled Deep State media empire.
(Article by William F. Jasper republished from TheNewAmerican.com)
Why the intense anxiety? As director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Admiral Rogers was then also chief of the Central Security Service (CSS) and commander of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). He had previously served as the director for intelligence for both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. Pacific Command, as well as commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet and commander of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command. In other words, he was the top dog in the world of signals intelligence (SIGINT) and held the keys to the kingdom of America’s powerful surveillance-state apparatus.
What was Admiral Rogers doing at Trump Tower? According to globalist Deep State media assets, such as the Washington Post, NPR, and the New York Times, he was ingratiating himself to Donald Trump, hoping to get a job in the new administration as director of national intelligence (DNI), a position then held by Obama appointee James Clapper. The admiral’s detractors claim that he was about to be fired by President Obama for NSA intelligence failures and for his “aloof” leadership style. But according to Rogers’ defenders, the admiral’s journey to New York was a daring mission to warn the incoming president about a treasonous coup plot involving top members of the Obama administration and key leaders in the other intelligence agencies. And the media efforts to denigrate Rogers’ reputation were aimed precisely at publicly undermining his credibility and the warning he was delivering.
The extraordinary events of the past four years support the position of Admiral Rogers’ advocates, not his attackers. We all have witnessed, in real time, an unprecedented and ongoing coup effort in which high-level officials within the Trump administration, together with members of Congress, former government officials, media organizations, major think tanks, tax-exempt foundations, labor unions, and militant street mobs have carried out a coordinated and relentless campaign of disruption, subversion, insurrection, sabotage, and “resistance” to cripple and topple President Donald J. Trump. During that time, a continuous stream of revelations — through leaks, whistleblowers, inspector general reports, court rulings, congressional investigations, and Department of Justice investigations — has provided crucial witness testimony and documentary evidence to connect many of the dots.
Some of these crucial disclosures have only come to light in the final weeks leading up to the November 2020 elections. It has taken that long — the entire (first) term of the Trump presidency — to pry loose the damning evidence of criminality and treachery behind, for instance, the infamous (and phony) “Steele dossier”; the illegal FISA court warrants obtained for Spygate; the sham “Trump-Russia collusion” charge; the vicious FBI/DOJ/Mueller railroading of General Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Roger Stone, and Paul Manafort; the real evidence of Hillary Clinton-Russia collusion; the FBI/DOJ/Mueller collusion with Hillary Clinton, Fusion GPS, and Crowdstrike — and much, much more.
The Empire Strikes Back
The Trump Tower rendezvous between the president-elect and the NSA chief, understandably, caused a panic attack among the Deep State coup plotters. Although the actual content of the conversation between Trump and Rogers has not been publicly revealed, all indications are that the admiral spilled some pretty big beans. On the same day of that meeting, having apparently been apprised by Rogers that they were being spied upon, the Trump Transition Team surprised everyone with the abrupt announcement that they were immediately moving all transition activity to Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump then had a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, constructed at Trump Tower to prevent hostile surveillance — from enemies both foreign and domestic. On November 19, 2016, two days after that historic Trump-Rogers meeting, the attacks on Admiral Rogers began. Naturally, the Deep State conspirators chose the Washington Post, their longtime favorite disinformation spigot, to lead the smear campaign. The Post article, entitled “Pentagon and intelligence community chiefs have urged Obama to remove the head of the NSA,” stated, “The heads of the Pentagon and the nation’s intelligence community have recommended to President Obama that the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, be removed.”
“The recommendation, delivered to the White House last month,” the story continued, “was made by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to several U.S. officials familiar with the matter.” Typical of media hatchet jobs, the article was replete with alleged negative statements and allegations by anonymous “senior officials.”
Although it is dangerous to believe anything carried in that lie factory, it turns out the Post was correct in stating that top Department of Defense and intelligence community officials were urging President Obama to fire Admiral Rogers even before his trip to Trump Tower. Why? Well, as we subsequently learned, Rogers had been throwing sand into the gears of the coup plotters for the past year, challenging and thwarting their illegal activities. It appears that for months prior to the Trump Tower meeting, Rogers had been playing a cat-and-mouse game with the Obama administration and its lackeys in the “Intelligence Community.” Defense Secretary Ashton “Ash” Carter, who is also a director of the globalist-minded Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, took the lead in calling for his ouster. However, apparently it was Department of Justice National Security Division (DOJ-NSD) head John P. Carlin who had been assigned the job of deep-sixing the troublesome admiral.
Jeff Carlson, who writes for the Epoch Times and has posted some of the most detailed and perceptive articles on the coup intrigue, wrote that “Carlin was setting up Rogers as the scapegoat” for the very crimes Rogers was trying to stop and expose. Rogers had gone to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to report violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the Obama administration and members of the intelligence community. Section 702 of FISA is aimed at protecting Americans against warrantless search and seizure. Under Section 702, the NSA “may not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States.” Among additional prohibitions, it “may not intentionally target a U.S. person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.”
Carlin was the official at DOJ responsible for ensuring that the administration abided by FISA restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. However, he had covered for the Obama administration’s routine violation of those restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. Admiral Rogers became aware of the serious nature and extent of FISA violations and ordered the NSA’s Office of Compliance to “do a fundamental baseline review of compliance associated with 702.” Among the findings of the review was that the FBI, which had access to NSA intercepts, was illegally sharing this FISA data on individuals with private contractors. This criminal use of private contractors was one of a number of violations condemned by FISC presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer in her stinging rebuke of the FBI in her April 26, 2017 ruling. This FBI abuse apparently had been brought to her attention by Admiral Rogers, who had already shut down all FBI contractor access a year before, in April 2016. Although Judge Collyer’s ruling redacts the names of the contractors, various analysts have reasonably suggested from clues in the text, timelines, and related data that at least some of the contractors cited are very likely entities associated with Hillary Clinton’s campaign, such as Fusion GPS and Crowdstrike.
Additionally, the NSA compliance review found numerous “About Query” violations. “Rogers shut down all ‘about query’ activity on Oct. 21, 2016,” reported Jeff Carlson in the Epoch Times on December 20, 2019. “‘About queries’ are particularly worrisome,” Carlson noted, “since they occur when the target is neither the sender nor the recipient of the collected communication; rather, the target’s ‘query,’ such as an email address, is being passed between two other communicants.”
Admiral Rogers and the FISA court also dinged the FBI and DOJ for failure to comply with Standard Minimization Procedures. The website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) describes “minimization” as “a detailed set of procedures designed to minimize the acquisition, retention, use and dissemination of U.S. person information acquired under Section 702.”
Subsequent revelations highlighted another egregious intelligence abuse, the illegal “unmasking” of individuals in NSA data by Obama officials. And as Representative Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), then chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said, these violations had “nothing to do” with Russia or national security matters. They were all about weaponizing and politicizing the intelligence functions.
Representative Nunes was one of many who came to Admiral Rogers’ defense when he was attacked by Carter, Clapper, and the Washington Post. Nunes’ defense of Rogers, as well as his pit-bull tenacity in exposing the criminal deeds of the coup plotters, soon earned him even more vicious attacks in the Deep State-aligned press than had been dished out to the NSA chief.
Taking Out His Teammates
For much the same reasons that they wanted to get rid of Admiral Rogers, the Deep State’s globalist elites wanted to make sure that General Michael Flynn would not survive as President Trump’s national security advisor. General Flynn had been director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under President Obama. However, he had been forced out, into early retirement, in 2014 by Clapper and Obama. He shares many of the traits of Admiral Rogers that make the insiders of the Obama-Biden-Clinton-Pelosi circles of power (and those above them) very nervous. He knows too much and can’t be depended on to go along with their subversion of the Constitution and the rule of law. Thus, he was forced to resign, by a campaign of lies and innuendo, on February 13, 2017, only 24 days after having been sworn in.
However, General Flynn’s long ordeal was just beginning. The coup plotters were determined to make an example of him, to crush him, to send him to prison. They very nearly succeeded. Four years later, the general’s tribulation is still not over. The Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr filed a motion on May 7, 2020 to dismiss with prejudice the charges against Flynn. The DOJ motion noted that Flynn’s questioning “was untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation.” However, federal district judge Emmet G. Sullivan has refused to dismiss the case and continues to fight the dismissal with extraordinary measures.
The pretext for the vendetta against General Flynn is the charge that he lied about the content and nature of his communications with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. This was all part and parcel of the hoax aimed at convincing the American public that Donald Trump and other members of his team were colluding with and/or were compromised by Russia and Vladimir Putin. The congressional investigations found no evidence to substantiate these charges. Neither did the much-ballyhooed two-year “Russia probe” by Office of Special Counsel (OSC) Robert Mueller. Nor did any of the media sleuths who had been trumpeting the “Russia, Russia, Russia” theme for four years.
Many stakes have been driven into the heart of the “Russia collusion” corpse, but the latest one delivered by FBI agent William Barnett this past September may finally do the job. Barnett, who was the FBI’s lead agent on the Flynn case, has described the investigation and prosecution of Flynn as an operation to “get Trump.” Barnett says he and other FBI and CIA investigators and analysts recognized early on that the probe was an “exercise in futility” and that the prosecutors were “groping” to find a crime. According to Barnett, top Mueller team prosecutors such as Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Weissmann were “obsessed” with finding a Trump-Russia connection and used overly aggressive tactics to obtain what they wanted. He says he had to intervene multiple times during interviews with Flynn and others due to misleading questions by Mueller team members.
FBI Director James Comey, Special Counsel Robert Mueller (a former FBI director), and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates had stacked the FBI/DOJ/OSC investigations with virulently partisan, anti-Trump staffers, as the notorious e-mail and text messages of FBI Agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page show.
Real Collusion: Russia-Hillary
On October 3, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified notes of former CIA Director John Brennan. It was an explosive revelation, but (surprise!) none of the “mainstream” media seemed to show the slightest interest. What did the notes reveal? They showed that Brennan had briefed former President Obama on July 26, 2016 concerning Hillary Clinton’s alleged “plan” to smear then-candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Russia as “a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.”
Brennan’s handwritten notes state:
We’re getting additional insight into Russian activities from [REDACTED]. . . CITE [summarizing] alleged approved by Hillary Clinton a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.
On July 31, 2016, five days after Brennan’s briefing of Obama on the Clinton scheme, Comey’s FBI opened its bogus “investigation” of the Trump campaign and its alleged ties to Russia.
Consider the enormity of this: The Steele dossier, as it has now been incontestably shown, was put together by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, with the assistance of Russian intelligence. It was then used by not only Hillary Clinton but also her co-conspirators Barack Obama, James Comey, James Clapper, Nancy Pelosi, Representative Adam Schiff, the Washington Post,the New York Times,CNN, CBS, and all the rest of the Deep State cabal to vilify Trump, precisely as directed in the Clinton scheme outlined in Brennan’s briefing to President Obama. So, it is Hillary Clinton who is the Russia colluder.
Then Clinton and her campaign lawyer Marc Elias repeatedly lied and denied any connection to the obscene “pee dossier” — until documentary evidence forced them to admit that they had financed it. Then Hil-lary switched her tune and even defended funding the dossier. It was just legit “opposition research,” she told ABC News.
Audacious it certainly was, especially since the Clinton-Russia ties go far deeper than her collusion with Russian intelligence to produce the aforementioned “Steele dossier.” It was/is Hillary Clinton (and her husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, and their Clinton Foundation), not Donald Trump, that has all the ties to Putin and Russia. As we have reported in The New American many times over the years, Hillary Clinton had notoriously concluded a number of deals with Putin’s regime that materially aided Russia’s military-industrial-techological advancement, while simultaneously striking serious blows to America’s national security. Along these lines we could mention, for example, the Uranium One deal that gave Russia a controlling interest in our American uranium production, and the technology transfers that have helped build Skolkovo, Russia’s hi-tech Silicon Valley.
Of course, that was already known by the Deep Staters who were, nevertheless, pushing the Trump-Russia theme with a vengeance.
Those Spreading the Lies
Thus far in this article we have focused primarily on the Deep State’s coup efforts through the operations of its captive intelligence agencies. This is not to suggest that all or even most of the men and women who serve in the FBI, CIA, DIA, and other intelligence-community agencies are parties to this treachery. Indeed, it is due to leaks and testimony from many brave and patriotic employees who have risked their careers, reputations, pensions — and even their lives — to expose the crimes and treason of the political hacks who are their bosses, that we know about the fraud and lies.
The intelligence community wields enormous power, but it is only one facet of the larger Deep State cabal that has been attacking the Trump administration — and America — from every angle and on every level.
Working closely in tandem with the Deep State intelligence community is the controlled establishment media, whose indispensable role we have highlighted in an article on page 16. Together with the Big Tech social-media giants and search engines — Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Reddit, Yahoo, Microsoft, Bing, etc. — they are transforming American society ever more rapidly to resemble the totalitarian system of Communist China. Not only are they dispensing statist prop-aganda that more and more mimics the Chinese Communist Party line, but in true Orwellian fashion they are blatantly punishing “thought crime” with censorship, demonetization, deplatforming, bullying, doxing, and label-lynching.
Deep State operatives within the intelligence community and throughout the federal bureaucracy also collude with the anti-Trump/anti-American media to produce a steady deluge of strategically timed leaks, many of which involve classified material, and all of which are calculated to disrupt and cripple the operations of government. Like the Antifa street thugs, they may as well adopt the revolutionary slogan, “Make America Ungovernable!”
Speaking of Antifa, we should mention here the important role they and their comrades in Black Lives Matter are playing in the orchestrated coup effort. Their job is to provide pressure from below while Deep State operatives in government and the media provide pressure from above. The BLM/Antifa rioters would have amounted to nothing except for: 1) the massive funding they have received from George Soros and other globalists; 2) the massive media promotion and propaganda they have enjoyed; 3) the enormous boost they have received from radical politicians and particularly from mayors and prosecutors (many of whom are Soros-funded) who refuse to prosecute the rioters; and 4) the crucial leadership of hard-core Marxist-Leninists of the Revolutionary Communist Party, the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and other revolutionary groups. But, naturally, these things are never mentioned by the controlled media, which would have us believe the lie that the BLM/Antifa mobs are authentic, grassroots organizations.
Still another important element of the ongoing coup effort is the campaign to expand and empower the United Nations and all of its programs. President Trump not only has initiated action to withdraw the United States from the disastrous UN Climate Accord, but also has terminated U.S. membership in UNESCO, WHO, and the UN Arms Trade Treaty, which is a thinly disguised attack on the Second Amendment. Obviously, these and other Trumpian attacks on the globalists’ New World Order could not be allowed to stand. Then we saw the convenient unleashing of the COVID-19 “pandemic” upon the world by Communist China to wreck the rebounding U.S. economy, while pro-Beijing globalists such as Bill Gates, George Soros, and their confreres at the Council on Foreign Relations and World Economic Forum have cheered the moves by Western governments to adopt Chinese-style totalitarianism and “global health governance.”
As we go to press (on November 5) the official results of the election are still up in the air, though it is obvious that operatives of the Deep State have been active at all levels, and using all illegal means at their disposal, to steal votes from President Trump and throw the count to Joe Biden. As the decision over who won the White House gets thrown to the courts, we can expect that the BLM/Antifa mobs will also be unleashed into the streets. There also are crucial U.S. Senate and House races that remain unresolved. The outcomes of these races will hugely impact our nation, not the least of matters being whether or not we will see a packing of the Supreme Court, as many leading Democrats are calling for.

‘Livid’ Limbaugh confident ‘Trump is going to win this’,"(Natural News) With no official winner declared in the 2020 presidential race, talk-radio star Rush Limbaugh said President Trump would, in fact, win the election when the final results are accurately sorted out.
(Article by Joe Kovacs republished from WND.com)
“Trump is going to win this,” Limbaugh said confidently on his national broadcast Wednesday. “We did, we have, we’ve reelected Trump. … This doesn’t mean that I’m not livid, and it doesn’t mean that I’m not ticked off and mad like all the rest of you are, because I am.”
“Donald Trump was not repudiated last night. Donald Trump was reelected last night. Time will show us this.”
Limbaugh, a staunch supporter of Trump and fellow resident of Palm Beach, Florida, said, “We were winning big last night. … That’s why they stopped the counting.”
“When they stopped counting, it means they’re looking for Democrat votes. It means they don’t have Democrat votes. It means they gotta go find ’em. We are wise to their ways now.”
“Why is it that every state that is not a swing state run by Democrats can keep their act together on Election Night?” he asked rhetorically.
“The Democrats, I can’t tell you how depressed they are today that Trump was not repudiated,” he continued. “That’s what they really wanted to happen.”
He said the Democratic mantra of “Count every ballot” is not legitimate.
“‘We’re not going to count every ballot. We’re going to count every legitimate vote. It’s a big difference. … We’re gonna win playing by the rules, despite the fact the other side does not.”
Limbaugh also suggested Fox News called the state of Arizona too early and mistakenly for Joe Biden as personal payback by the network after Trump had publicly criticized the network on “Fox and Friends” this week.
“It’s personal. It was absolutely personal. But Trump’s gonna end up winning Arizona. … I think he already has. It’s just a matter of this playing out.”
“That Arizona call, the investigation of that … I think it’s gonna reveal some fascinating things that are going on in the bowels of the decision desk at the Fox News Channel.”
He called the outcome of huge support for the president “a devastating night” for Democrats.
“It was so huge the Democrats never saw it coming,” he noted. “These people are vindictive. They are single-mindedly hateful … They have been waiting, and they have been dreaming, they have been hoping, they have been planning on, they have been counting on you and every other American telling Donald Trump to go to hell yesterday — and that didn’t happen. … They literally thought Trump was going to be sent packing.”
Limbaugh said he talked with White House officials who say anywhere from two-thirds to 70 percent of Arizona votes are coming to the president, meaning that state could be counted in Trump’s favor.
Limbaugh urged his listeners: “The American way of life is going to be preserved. Keep the faith. The best days of our country are still ahead of us.”
“We want love and peace in our lives. We want our lives to be pleasant.”

Video: Deranged Olbermann calls for coup against President Trump,"(Natural News) In a venom filled online rant, Keith Olbermann called for President Trump to be dragged out of the White House immediately in handcuffs.
(Article by swatson republished from Summit.news)
“TRUMP HAS LOST HIS MIND AND MUST BE REMOVED, TONIGHT,” Olbermann tweeted, along with the video of him ranting on his online program literally titled Olbermann vs Trump.
“The coup attempt, we can survive. A mentally incompetent president, we may not. Instead, he will stay, and when he concedes he will simultaneously begin a campaign for 2024.” Olbermann stated.
Olbermann called Trump “President Karen” and a “lame duck president.”
TRUMP MUST BE REMOVED AND ARRESTED, TONIGHT. Gripped by a paranoid delusion, threatening the nation's safety, this can't wait any longer. It won't happen; in fact he'll probably concede and instantly announce he's running in '24.

Here is the full 10 minute mental breakdown, for those who can stomach it:
President Trump vowed last night to take the matter of election theft to the highest court in the land, noting “We think there’ll be a lot of litigation, because we cannot have an election stolen like this.”
Once a respected newsreader who espoused nuanced positions including opposition to illegal invasions in the Middle East, Olbermann is now completely unhinged, engaging in endless ‘orange man bad’ rants.
Last month Olbermann said Trump should be executed over the handling of the coronavirus:

Left-wing media journalist says 75% of media writers have “side job destroying Trump ballots”,"(Natural News) Jon Schwarz, a prominent left-wing writer for The Intercept, thinks that destroying the ballots of people who vote for Donald Trump is the moral solution to preventing a second Trump term.
According to Schwarz, who also writes for The New York Times, The Atlantic and other far-left media outlets, “at least” 75 percent of those who work in the mainstream media – “including me,” he tweeted – have “a side job destroying Trump ballots.”
“When you love something as much as we love destroying Trump ballots, you make the time,” he tweeted back on Nov. 1, 2016.
Schwarz added in a series of other tweets the same day that destroying Trump ballots is “not a felony.” He also added that “the constitution says you can destroy trump ballots,” presumably joking – but how does one really tell anymore?
In a recent article he wrote entitled, “The Election Isn’t Over Until Trump’s Gone,” Schwarz suggested that people who hate Trump need to initiate “street fights” in the event that Trump wins reelection on Nov. 3.
Schwarz also believes that illegal aliens should not only be allowed to vote, but to do so multiple times until Democrat candidates are able to “win.”
A self-described alum of filmmaker Michael Moore’s Dog Eat Dog films, as well as “a research producer for Moore’s Capitalism: A Love Story,” Schwarz is hellbent on removing Trump from office through any means possible.
After being accused of visiting a voting site during the 2016 election “to fake IDs & assist in ferrying illegals from polling station to polling station,” Schwarz responded unashamedly with:
“let’s not rest on our laurels though, everyone’s needed in Wisconsin to destroy Trump ballots during the recount.”

Schwarz supports militant Antifa-backed Transition Integrity Project
Should Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not win in a landslide on Nov. 3, Schwarz’s allies over at the Transition Integrity Project (TIP) are planning to unleash hell across America.
The so-called “Fight Back Table” has indicated plans to initiate “mass public unrest” in the event that Trump wins, and Schwarz wants to take it all a step further with mass violence.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly taken notice of Schwarz’s statements and behavior, having launched an investigation into a positive reaction that Schwarz had to a tweet by Huffington Post editor Nick Baumann that reads:
“i love my job working at a voting site in washington dc destroying trump ballots.”
After Baumann came out to state that he was joking, Schwarz chimed in and stated that he:
“want[ed] to emphasize to the FBI that, while @nickbaumann was joking, I was completely serious. I am not kidding.”
Schwarz further bragged that he has supposedly “destroy[ed] 1000s of ballots,” further expressing confusion that the FBI “is investigating Nick for jokes when I’m the one who destroyed 1000s of ballots.”
Since “lots more people want [Trump] to be president” than Biden or anyone else – Schwarz’s words, not ours – Schwarz has made it his personal mission to “destroy the ballots” to try to keep Trump out of office.
Schwarz now claims that all of these tweets were mere jokes, despite the incredible volume of them that would suggest otherwise. He apparently thinks he is quite the funny guy who compensates for his lack of wit by suggesting that he commits election fraud for fun.
“Still waiting on your piece debunking police shooting stats,” wrote one Twitter user trying to get Schwarz’s attention concerning a promise he apparently made in an earlier article about police violence.
“It never materialize[d]. I guess you’re busy with other stuff.”

State Department is preventing Biden from accessing messages from foreign leaders,"Washington (CNN)A stack of messages from foreign leaders to President-elect Joe Biden are sitting at the State Department but the Trump administration is preventing him from accessing them, according to State Department officials familiar with the messages.
Traditionally, the State Department supports all communications for the President-elect, which is why many countries began sending messages to State over the weekend. But with Biden prohibited from accessing State Department resources by the Trump administration, because President Donald Trump refuses to accept Biden's victory, dozens of incoming messages have not been received.
Biden's team is contacting foreign governments on their own and he has held numerous calls with leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel and Canada's Justin Trudeau. But they are operating without the logistical and translation support that the State Department operations center provides.
""They would prefer to be using the State Department resources,"" said a source familiar with the situation, who noted that the Biden team is having to deal with the unexpected challenge of facilitating these calls.
Not only is Biden being blocked by the State Department from receiving messages and assistance facilitating and from preparing for calls, on Tuesday Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to acknowledge Biden's victory, saying that ""there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" igniting a furor and roiling diplomats.
Biden is also being blocked from getting the same intelligence briefings as the President, known as the President's Daily Brief, and should the Trump administration continue to block a typical transition close to Inauguration Day on January 20, there are concerns Biden's administration will be playing catch-up the day he takes office.
Foreign leaders have begun to figure out that State cannot get them in touch with the President-elect and their teams have reached out to former Obama-era diplomats for their assistance on how to send congratulatory messages to Biden's team, sources told CNN. Some foreign governments feel they are navigating an unfamiliar maze, foreign diplomats have told CNN.
""It was helpful to have State ops place the calls and to provide translation services, and we were grateful for the cooperation from the Bush administration for making that happen,"" said Denis McDonough, who served in the Obama administration and worked with Obama during the transition.
The calls taking place right now are not highly sensitive, and even during a well-oiled transition period they are not normally conducted on secure lines, multiple sources explained.
""These calls in the past have been handled on open lines. They are congratulatory calls,"" McDonough said, adding that both sides are providing readouts, which is consistent with protocol.
Barack Obama often made these calls to foreign leaders on his cell phone when he was President-elect, explained a State Department official who worked on setting up those calls at the time. But they all went through the operations center, which meant there is a government record of the calls he made.
Career officials at the State Department are ready to help the Biden team when the time comes.
""The agencies implemented the law faithfully prior to the election. The materials are ready, the offices are ready, everything is ready; they are waiting for the green light,"" said David Marchick, the director of the Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service.
Operating without State Department support right now, the Biden team -- made up of many experienced former government officials -- has sent out readouts of all of the calls, which help with record keeping. They are making an effort to formalize the process and will use State Department resources when they are available, said a source familiar with the unfolding situation.
This is a stark contrast with the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. At the time, President-elect Trump opted not to use State Department resources. Instead, he made his calls out of Trump Tower and resisted using the government support and coordination system, which meant that translators and staff sat waiting without any work while Trump made calls on his own, a State Department official told CNN at the time.
At any other point since Biden left the White House, he would have been able to call into the State Department operations center to place a call to a foreign leader, State Department officials told CNN. Former presidents and vice presidents are allowed to use the resource whenever they wish. But now, as he is President-elect, Biden is being prevented from using that facility by the Trump administration.

"White House political director tests positive for coronavirus, official says","(CNN)White House political affairs director Brian Jack has tested positive for coronavirus, an official confirmed to CNN on Wednesday.
The White House declined to comment on Jack specifically, but said in a statement that positive cases are ""taken seriously.""
""Contact tracing has been conducted by the White House Medical Unit consistent with CDC guidelines to stop further transmission. Appropriate notifications and recommendations have been made,"" the statement said.
Jack attended the election night party held indoors over a week ago. The news was first reported by The New York Times.
This story is breaking and will be updated.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/brian-jack-coronavirus-white-house/index.html,Kaitlan Collins,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 19:33:25 GMT",CNN,1
White House coronavirus task force warns of 'accelerating community spread',"(CNN)The White House coronavirus task force is again alerting states of ""accelerating"" coronavirus spread as cases and hospitalizations rapidly rise across the country with few signs of stabilizing. It strongly recommends increased testing in its weekly reports to states.
""There is continued, accelerating community spread across the top half of the country, where temperatures have cooled and Americans have moved indoors,"" reports dated November 8 and distributed to states Tuesday evening said.
The task force, which warned of ""significant deterioration in the Sunbelt"" in last week's set of reports, said that that deterioration has only continued in the past week, ""leading to the most diffuse spread experienced to date.""
The weekly task force reports continue to provide an unvarnished, unfiltered look at the reality of each state's current situation, which comes as President Donald Trump and task force leader Vice President Mike Pence have declined to address the worsening pandemic publicly in weeks. The White House has repeatedly declined to make all of the reports publicly accessible.
In recommendations to several states, the task force called for an expansion of testing, particularly to target asymptomatic cases.
""The silent community spread that precedes and continues throughout surges can only be identified and interrupted through proactive and increased testing and surveillance,"" reports for multiple states said, suggesting expanding point-of-care antigen tests.
The reports said: ""Proactive testing must be part of the mitigation efforts, inclusive of mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and immediate isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine.""
A report for New Mexico, where the task force said there is ""full and unrelenting community spread,"" noted that requiring testing only for individuals experiencing Covid-19 symptoms ""is preventing adequate testing and control of the pandemic.""
North Dakota remains the state with the highest number of new cases per 100,000 population, followed by South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana, Illinois, Utah and Minnesota in the top 10.
Vermont remains the state with the lowest number of cases and is one of only two states, including Hawaii, in the task force-defined ""yellow zone"" for new cases, meaning between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 population. But Vermont was still warned in its report that there is ""cause for concern given the continued uptick in the state"" coinciding with colder weather.
The report for Ohio described ""vast and unmitigated community spread"" with ""no evidence of improvement.""
In Delaware, where cases are disproportionately affecting young adults between 20 and 35 years of age, the task force said, ""We share the assessment of Delaware leaders that the Covid epidemic is likely to worsen.""
Some state reports reiterated the need for communication of ""basic actions"" residents should take.
""Do not gather without a mask with individuals living outside of your household,"" ""Always wear a mask in public places,"" ""Stop gatherings beyond immediate household until cases and test positivity are in the yellow zone"" and ""Get your flu shot,"" the reports warned.
And, as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, one state's report stressed the need for indoor mask usage.
""We need to protect those we are thankful for in our families and communities. Ensure indoor masking around vulnerable family members during any gatherings due to the significant amount of virus circulating and the high rate of asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections among family and community members,"" the report said.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/coronavirus-task-force-state-reports/index.html,Betsy Klein,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:22:00 GMT",CNN,1
Alarm grows over Trump's 'dictator moves' as he denies election defeat,"(CNN)President Donald Trump's administration is taking on the characteristics of a tottering regime -- with its loyalty tests, destabilizing attacks on the military chain of command, a deepening bunker mentality and increasingly delusional claims of political victory.
In response, a visibly confident President-elect Joe Biden is going out of his way to project calm amid the deepening chaos, even as Trump and senior Republicans still refuse to acknowledge the President's defeat in a stunning break with America's democratic traditions.
Biden is taking calls with leaders of the country's top allies, which reflects the inevitability of his ascent to power. While the President is staying behind closed doors, tweeting in wild block capital letters and unleashing a purge of the Pentagon's civilian leadership, Biden is on camera. The President-elect is reassuring the American people with a composure granted by an election win that Trump's threadbare legal cases baselessly alleging massive voter fraud have little chance of overturning the will of the voters.
The President-elect on Tuesday consciously avoided escalating a confrontation with Trump, who is withholding the access and funding that incoming presidents normally rely on to stand up their administrations. But while Trump will remain President until January 20, an unmistakable symbolic transfer of authority is taking place despite Trump's efforts to deny his successor legitimacy.
""We don't see anything that's slowing us down, quite frankly,"" Biden said.
The President-elect has already crossed the necessary threshold of 270 electoral votes, according to projections from CNN and other major news outlets and has a chance of matching Trump's 2016 total of 306 electoral votes given his leads in Georgia and Arizona.
And more false accusations and conspiracy theories touted by Trump supporters to claim electoral fraud are dissolving, a day after Attorney General William Barr stepped into the political fray to advise prosecutors to probe major fraud.
The Department of Homeland Security meanwhile pushed back on rumors that ballots were cast on behalf of dead people.
But the Trump team only dug itself deeper into a bizarre parallel universe -- one where the President has already secured a second term -- consistent with the embrace of misinformation and alternative facts that has characterized the last four years.
The administration's defiance took an even more ridiculous twist on Tuesday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo showed his loyalty to a leader who shows no sign of working on key issues -- including a pandemic that has now landed more Americans in hospitals than ever before.
""There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" Pompeo said. Asked whether Trump's refusal to concede undercut traditional US critiques of corrupt elections abroad, Pompeo rounded on a reporter: ""That's ridiculous. And you know it's ridiculous, and you asked it because it's ridiculous."" As recently as Monday, Pompeo issued a statement warning of electoral issues in Myanmar, which was long ruled by the military and has endured a difficult transition to semi-democracy where dissidents once looked at the US as a lodestar.
In Wilmington, Delaware, the President-elect pointedly refused to pour fuel on the fire, dismissing the idea that he needed to take legal action to release transition funds and making clear that he was confident that the process of assuming power would eventually work itself out.
He described Trump's behavior since Election Day as ""an embarrassment"" and after saying he was seeking to be tactful added: ""It will not help the President's legacy."" Asked whether Republicans would ever accept his victory, he said, ""They will, they will,"" and he suggested with a half-smile that GOP senators were ""mildly intimidated"" by the President.
Biden, who once had a reputation as a windy public speaker, is showing a new persona to the American people. He noticeably chose his words carefully on Tuesday, putting on a show of calm, as he experiences the transformation that often comes over victorious candidates as they begin to assume the weight of the presidency after winning elections.
Trump by contrast is tarnishing the instruments of American democracy by refusing to concede and leaving the country more vulnerable with revenge firings that threaten to weaken critical national security agencies.
After Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had put loyalty to the Constitution ahead of his duty to the President, three other senior Pentagon officials have been fired or resigned. They include the department's top policy official, James Anderson, who resigned and is being replaced by retired Brigadier General Anthony Tata, whose nomination for the post earlier this summer foundered after CNN's KFile reported his numerous past Islamophobic and offensive remarks.
Sources told Barbara Starr and CNN's Pentagon team that the dismissals might be motivated by pushback from Esper and his team against a withdrawal from Afghanistan that would be carried out before the required conditions on the ground were met, and other pending security issues.
""This is scary, it's very unsettling,"" one defense official told CNN. ""These are dictator moves.""
A disputed transfer of power could offer US adversaries an opening, especially if there is a belief abroad that there is disarray in the national security infrastructure. Trump may next turn his ire on CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Christopher Wray, CNN's Jake Tapper has reported. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on CNN International Tuesday that he feared the US was entering a dangerous period.
""I think (Trump) is going to be uniquely distracted from world events and national security,"" Murphy said. Former national security adviser John Bolton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Pompeo's comments on a Trump transition were ""delusional.""
""I think he has eviscerated his credibility internationally because I think there are very few people even in the US government who believe that is the case,"" Bolton said.
Despite Trump's claims that his second term is being stolen from him, the President's legal claim has so far made no headway in its efforts to claim massive fraud. The gambit looks increasingly like a political exercise as Trump struggles to come to terms with his defeat while Republican senators scared of the President's political base refuse to cross him, especially with two Georgia run-off elections scheduled for January that will decide control of their chamber.
Trump's already minuscule opportunity to change the course of the election is diminishing by the day. Biden is now more than 46,000 votes ahead in Pennsylvania, is up by 12,000 in Georgia and has a lead of 14,000 ballots in Arizona. It is not clear whether there are sufficient remaining votes left in the Grand Canyon state for the President to overtake the President-elect.
As the Trump campaign filed a new long-shot lawsuit in Michigan, which Biden won by nearly than 150,000 votes, its communications director Tim Murtaugh said, ""We do believe that ultimately President Trump will be declared the winner of this election.""
But Benjamin Ginsberg, a veteran Republican election lawyer, said that the Trump campaign ""was a long way from nowhere"" in its quest to overturn the outcome of the election.
""To win cases, they have to put enough results into play to change the outcome of the election in individual states and in none of the suits they have filed around the country are they anywhere close to doing that in any state,"" Ginsberg said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""
Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dug in Tuesday on his insistence that Trump was within his rights to pursue his complaints.
""I think we ought to quit all the hand-wringing and not act like this is extraordinary,"" the newly reelected Kentucky Republican said.
""We're going to get through this period and we'll swear in the winner on January the 20th, 2021, just like we have every four years since 1793.""
While many observers believe McConnell is playing a long political game — with the Georgia run-offs and the 2022 midterm congressional elections in mind, the silence of Republican senators is emboldening Trump's intransigence.
The world has already moved on
But while GOP lawmakers aren't willing to break with the President, many world leaders are moving to embrace Biden -- including a number of whom who saw themselves as ideological counterparts of the President.
Biden's campaign released statements on the President-elect's calls with the leaders of France, Germany and Ireland. Biden also spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose populist leanings made him a good fit with Trump. Johnson promised to work with Biden in a post-Covid-19 era.
Even Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who bonded with Trump over their common strongman tendencies, issued a public message congratulating Biden on his ""election success."" And Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- who has a close and controversial relationship with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner -- sent Biden a cable in which they conveyed congratulations on ""His Excellency's victory in the presidential elections.""
Biden said he had a simple message for all the world leaders: ""I am letting them know America is back.""

Republican senator says he will step in if Biden doesn't have access to intelligence briefings by Friday,"(CNN)Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford said Wednesday that he will intervene if the Trump administration has not allowed President-elect Joe Biden access to presidential daily intelligence briefings by the end of the week, one of the first rights of a presidential candidate after winning the election.
""There is no loss from him getting the briefings and to be able to do that,"" Lankford told radio station KRMG, noting that he sits on the Senate Oversight Committee and that he's already started engaging on this issue.
The Oklahoma Republican said if no progress is made on the issue by Friday, he will step in and say, ""This needs to occur so that regardless of the outcome of the election, whichever way that it goes, people can be ready for that actual task.""
Lankford's comment comes as Biden and his senior advisers are not yet receiving the President's Daily Brief, the highly classified intelligence briefings about pressing national security issues that their soon-to-be predecessor has been offered daily.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Monday that Biden's lack of access stems from the election being not yet ascertained by the General Services Administration -- a clear indication that the Biden transition team is not getting the same briefings that presidents-elect typically receive.
It remains unclear whether the race needs to be ascertained before the President-elect can legally receive the briefings. Biden has said that the daily briefings ""would be useful, but it's not necessary.""
Lankford on Wednesday also referenced the abbreviated 2000 transition, which a bipartisan 9/11 report said contributed to a lack of security preparedness ahead of the 9/11 terror attacks.
""There's nothing wrong with Vice President Biden getting the briefings to be able to prepare himself and so that he can be ready -- the President's already getting those,"" Lankford said, adding that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a Democratic senator from California, also has the appropriate clearances to begin receiving briefings because she serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, also called for Biden to receive the briefings.
""As has been done in every other transition, the President should order that Biden and his team receive the PDB, as has been done in the past, even during the contested election of 2000,"" Warner said Wednesday. ""It's simply irresponsible to withhold this in these uncertain times.""
Like most of his Republican colleagues, Lankford did not go so far as to acknowledge that Biden is the president-elect after every major news organization projected his victory on Saturday.
Lankford defended the President's many legal disputes, saying the best thing right now is for Trump to be able to go through the legal process and ""get real answers"" before the Electoral College casts ballots in December.
There is no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in this election.
In the meantime, Lankford said, ""Joe Biden can continue to be able to function and say, 'I'm the president-elect,' and great if you want to say that, go do it, and to be able to do your preparation work. The President can say, 'Not so fast. I've got questions to answer.' Great, go ask them.""
Lankford implied that if the President is not able to follow through with its legal proceedings, it might stoke conspiracies among Trump supporters.
But judges have quickly dismissed cases that attempt to raise the possibility of voting irregularities, while elections experts make clear Biden's margin of victory is too wide for court cases to reverse and that existing court cases deal with too few votes, if any, to matter.
Asked about concerns at the Pentagon after Defense Secretary Mark Esper's firing on Monday and other moves by the administration that put a peaceful transfer of power into question, Lankford replied, ""I can assure you, there will be a peaceful transition of power in the United States.""
Lankford downplayed the significance of Esper's firing within days of the election, saying it was ""obviously long-planned"" and not just from a ""single petty event from months ago.""
He said, though, that he personally would not have made that change ""with the next two months"" -- seeming to refer to the two-month period until the inauguration -- again without fully acknowledging Biden as President-elect.
""It was a clear signal with preparation behind the scenes for a good transition at the Pentagon,"" Lankford said.

"Democrats create “Donald Trump Watch” website containing home addresses of Trump donors for Antifa, BLM to target","(Natural News) Left-wingers are once again showing their unique brand of love and tolerance for the opposition by launching a new website that doxes everyone in the country who contributed money to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, sharing their home addresses online.
Known as “Donald Trump Watch,” the site features an unsightly image of Trump grimacing alongside the words, “Americans that Give Money to Support a Racist.” Below it, users can search by zip code or street address to see who near them has ever donated money to Trump.
After plugging in an address or zip code, users are presented with a clickable map full of pins and addresses of Trump supporters in the area who supported a “racist” with their cash donations.
The top of the site features a quote from Voltaire that insinuates Trump is a dictator akin to Adolph Hitler:
“Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.”
Since the Donald Trump Watch site draws from publicly available information compiled by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), it is not technically illegal (as far as we know). However, it does tee-up Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Antifa to easily target Trump supporters for organized “protests.”
Why are the communist Chinese encouraging BLM, Antifa to commit violence against Trump supporters?
While claiming to be a privately owned entity not connected to any government agency, a little digging reveals that Donald Trump Watch is actually run by a company tied to the communist Chinese regime.
Dynadot LLC, the registered company associated with the site, is based out of San Mateo, Calif., but also has two offices in China – one in Zhenzhou and another in Beijing. Dynadot also apparently has an office in Toronto.
“Dynadot is a privately held ICANN accredited domain name registrar and web hosting company founded by software engineer Todd Han in 2002,” claims Wikipedia.
“Dynadot’s headquarters is established in San Mateo, California, with offices in Zhengzhou and Beijing, China, as well as Toronto, Canada.”
The group behind Dynadot is called Public Service Media Group, Inc., a corporation based out of Delaware where Joe Biden is from. It has three one-star reviews on Spokeo, one of which reads as follows:
“This company … is terrible, real scum lowlifes! They have a website where they publish all President Trump supporters / donors. So it makes it easier to be harassed by the terrorist group known as Antifa, which how they are still walking around beating up helpless people is beyond me!”
Another reviewer claims to be in pursuit of the owner of Public Service Media Group in order to file a lawsuit.
“He / she is responsible for a website called ‘Racism Watch’ that publishes names and addresses of individuals who make monetary donations to the Donald J. Trump campaign,” along with an email where information can be sent.
As far as we can tell, none of the major social media platforms have censored their users from sharing the link to Donald Trump Watch, despite the fact that it encourages people who hate Trump to harass and even harm his supporters and donors.
NBC News‘ Brandy Zadrozny would be proud, seeing as how she gets paid by her employer to do much the same, digging up information about Trump supporters in order to put them in the crosshairs of Antifa and BLM.
“The list isn’t going to tell anyone anything that the giant Trump flag outside my house isn’t already telling them,” wrote one commenter at The Gateway Pundit.
“But this is called terrorism, doxing people is a threat against people and their families in order to intimidate them into changing their behavior so that the terrorists can achieve a political objective. Antifa and all their allies need to be charged as terrorists.”

The non-stop effort to take down Trump and America,"(Natural News) On November 17, 2016, a meeting that may turn out to have been one of the most pivotal in American history took place at Trump Tower in New York City. On that day, nine days after the tumultuous 2016 presidential election, Admiral Michael S. Rogers met secretly with President-elect Donald Trump. It was a meeting that set off Deep State alarms, and those alarm bells instantly started echoing throughout the controlled Deep State media empire.
(Article by William F. Jasper republished from TheNewAmerican.com)
Why the intense anxiety? As director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Admiral Rogers was then also chief of the Central Security Service (CSS) and commander of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). He had previously served as the director for intelligence for both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. Pacific Command, as well as commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet and commander of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command. In other words, he was the top dog in the world of signals intelligence (SIGINT) and held the keys to the kingdom of America’s powerful surveillance-state apparatus.
What was Admiral Rogers doing at Trump Tower? According to globalist Deep State media assets, such as the Washington Post, NPR, and the New York Times, he was ingratiating himself to Donald Trump, hoping to get a job in the new administration as director of national intelligence (DNI), a position then held by Obama appointee James Clapper. The admiral’s detractors claim that he was about to be fired by President Obama for NSA intelligence failures and for his “aloof” leadership style. But according to Rogers’ defenders, the admiral’s journey to New York was a daring mission to warn the incoming president about a treasonous coup plot involving top members of the Obama administration and key leaders in the other intelligence agencies. And the media efforts to denigrate Rogers’ reputation were aimed precisely at publicly undermining his credibility and the warning he was delivering.
The extraordinary events of the past four years support the position of Admiral Rogers’ advocates, not his attackers. We all have witnessed, in real time, an unprecedented and ongoing coup effort in which high-level officials within the Trump administration, together with members of Congress, former government officials, media organizations, major think tanks, tax-exempt foundations, labor unions, and militant street mobs have carried out a coordinated and relentless campaign of disruption, subversion, insurrection, sabotage, and “resistance” to cripple and topple President Donald J. Trump. During that time, a continuous stream of revelations — through leaks, whistleblowers, inspector general reports, court rulings, congressional investigations, and Department of Justice investigations — has provided crucial witness testimony and documentary evidence to connect many of the dots.
Some of these crucial disclosures have only come to light in the final weeks leading up to the November 2020 elections. It has taken that long — the entire (first) term of the Trump presidency — to pry loose the damning evidence of criminality and treachery behind, for instance, the infamous (and phony) “Steele dossier”; the illegal FISA court warrants obtained for Spygate; the sham “Trump-Russia collusion” charge; the vicious FBI/DOJ/Mueller railroading of General Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Roger Stone, and Paul Manafort; the real evidence of Hillary Clinton-Russia collusion; the FBI/DOJ/Mueller collusion with Hillary Clinton, Fusion GPS, and Crowdstrike — and much, much more.
The Empire Strikes Back
The Trump Tower rendezvous between the president-elect and the NSA chief, understandably, caused a panic attack among the Deep State coup plotters. Although the actual content of the conversation between Trump and Rogers has not been publicly revealed, all indications are that the admiral spilled some pretty big beans. On the same day of that meeting, having apparently been apprised by Rogers that they were being spied upon, the Trump Transition Team surprised everyone with the abrupt announcement that they were immediately moving all transition activity to Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump then had a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, constructed at Trump Tower to prevent hostile surveillance — from enemies both foreign and domestic. On November 19, 2016, two days after that historic Trump-Rogers meeting, the attacks on Admiral Rogers began. Naturally, the Deep State conspirators chose the Washington Post, their longtime favorite disinformation spigot, to lead the smear campaign. The Post article, entitled “Pentagon and intelligence community chiefs have urged Obama to remove the head of the NSA,” stated, “The heads of the Pentagon and the nation’s intelligence community have recommended to President Obama that the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, be removed.”
“The recommendation, delivered to the White House last month,” the story continued, “was made by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to several U.S. officials familiar with the matter.” Typical of media hatchet jobs, the article was replete with alleged negative statements and allegations by anonymous “senior officials.”
Although it is dangerous to believe anything carried in that lie factory, it turns out the Post was correct in stating that top Department of Defense and intelligence community officials were urging President Obama to fire Admiral Rogers even before his trip to Trump Tower. Why? Well, as we subsequently learned, Rogers had been throwing sand into the gears of the coup plotters for the past year, challenging and thwarting their illegal activities. It appears that for months prior to the Trump Tower meeting, Rogers had been playing a cat-and-mouse game with the Obama administration and its lackeys in the “Intelligence Community.” Defense Secretary Ashton “Ash” Carter, who is also a director of the globalist-minded Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, took the lead in calling for his ouster. However, apparently it was Department of Justice National Security Division (DOJ-NSD) head John P. Carlin who had been assigned the job of deep-sixing the troublesome admiral.
Jeff Carlson, who writes for the Epoch Times and has posted some of the most detailed and perceptive articles on the coup intrigue, wrote that “Carlin was setting up Rogers as the scapegoat” for the very crimes Rogers was trying to stop and expose. Rogers had gone to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to report violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the Obama administration and members of the intelligence community. Section 702 of FISA is aimed at protecting Americans against warrantless search and seizure. Under Section 702, the NSA “may not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States.” Among additional prohibitions, it “may not intentionally target a U.S. person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.”
Carlin was the official at DOJ responsible for ensuring that the administration abided by FISA restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. However, he had covered for the Obama administration’s routine violation of those restrictions, prohibitions, and procedures. Admiral Rogers became aware of the serious nature and extent of FISA violations and ordered the NSA’s Office of Compliance to “do a fundamental baseline review of compliance associated with 702.” Among the findings of the review was that the FBI, which had access to NSA intercepts, was illegally sharing this FISA data on individuals with private contractors. This criminal use of private contractors was one of a number of violations condemned by FISC presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer in her stinging rebuke of the FBI in her April 26, 2017 ruling. This FBI abuse apparently had been brought to her attention by Admiral Rogers, who had already shut down all FBI contractor access a year before, in April 2016. Although Judge Collyer’s ruling redacts the names of the contractors, various analysts have reasonably suggested from clues in the text, timelines, and related data that at least some of the contractors cited are very likely entities associated with Hillary Clinton’s campaign, such as Fusion GPS and Crowdstrike.
Additionally, the NSA compliance review found numerous “About Query” violations. “Rogers shut down all ‘about query’ activity on Oct. 21, 2016,” reported Jeff Carlson in the Epoch Times on December 20, 2019. “‘About queries’ are particularly worrisome,” Carlson noted, “since they occur when the target is neither the sender nor the recipient of the collected communication; rather, the target’s ‘query,’ such as an email address, is being passed between two other communicants.”
Admiral Rogers and the FISA court also dinged the FBI and DOJ for failure to comply with Standard Minimization Procedures. The website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) describes “minimization” as “a detailed set of procedures designed to minimize the acquisition, retention, use and dissemination of U.S. person information acquired under Section 702.”
Subsequent revelations highlighted another egregious intelligence abuse, the illegal “unmasking” of individuals in NSA data by Obama officials. And as Representative Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), then chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said, these violations had “nothing to do” with Russia or national security matters. They were all about weaponizing and politicizing the intelligence functions.
Representative Nunes was one of many who came to Admiral Rogers’ defense when he was attacked by Carter, Clapper, and the Washington Post. Nunes’ defense of Rogers, as well as his pit-bull tenacity in exposing the criminal deeds of the coup plotters, soon earned him even more vicious attacks in the Deep State-aligned press than had been dished out to the NSA chief.
Taking Out His Teammates
For much the same reasons that they wanted to get rid of Admiral Rogers, the Deep State’s globalist elites wanted to make sure that General Michael Flynn would not survive as President Trump’s national security advisor. General Flynn had been director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under President Obama. However, he had been forced out, into early retirement, in 2014 by Clapper and Obama. He shares many of the traits of Admiral Rogers that make the insiders of the Obama-Biden-Clinton-Pelosi circles of power (and those above them) very nervous. He knows too much and can’t be depended on to go along with their subversion of the Constitution and the rule of law. Thus, he was forced to resign, by a campaign of lies and innuendo, on February 13, 2017, only 24 days after having been sworn in.
However, General Flynn’s long ordeal was just beginning. The coup plotters were determined to make an example of him, to crush him, to send him to prison. They very nearly succeeded. Four years later, the general’s tribulation is still not over. The Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr filed a motion on May 7, 2020 to dismiss with prejudice the charges against Flynn. The DOJ motion noted that Flynn’s questioning “was untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation.” However, federal district judge Emmet G. Sullivan has refused to dismiss the case and continues to fight the dismissal with extraordinary measures.
The pretext for the vendetta against General Flynn is the charge that he lied about the content and nature of his communications with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. This was all part and parcel of the hoax aimed at convincing the American public that Donald Trump and other members of his team were colluding with and/or were compromised by Russia and Vladimir Putin. The congressional investigations found no evidence to substantiate these charges. Neither did the much-ballyhooed two-year “Russia probe” by Office of Special Counsel (OSC) Robert Mueller. Nor did any of the media sleuths who had been trumpeting the “Russia, Russia, Russia” theme for four years.
Many stakes have been driven into the heart of the “Russia collusion” corpse, but the latest one delivered by FBI agent William Barnett this past September may finally do the job. Barnett, who was the FBI’s lead agent on the Flynn case, has described the investigation and prosecution of Flynn as an operation to “get Trump.” Barnett says he and other FBI and CIA investigators and analysts recognized early on that the probe was an “exercise in futility” and that the prosecutors were “groping” to find a crime. According to Barnett, top Mueller team prosecutors such as Jeannie Rhee and Andrew Weissmann were “obsessed” with finding a Trump-Russia connection and used overly aggressive tactics to obtain what they wanted. He says he had to intervene multiple times during interviews with Flynn and others due to misleading questions by Mueller team members.
FBI Director James Comey, Special Counsel Robert Mueller (a former FBI director), and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates had stacked the FBI/DOJ/OSC investigations with virulently partisan, anti-Trump staffers, as the notorious e-mail and text messages of FBI Agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page show.
Real Collusion: Russia-Hillary
On October 3, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified notes of former CIA Director John Brennan. It was an explosive revelation, but (surprise!) none of the “mainstream” media seemed to show the slightest interest. What did the notes reveal? They showed that Brennan had briefed former President Obama on July 26, 2016 concerning Hillary Clinton’s alleged “plan” to smear then-candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Russia as “a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.”
Brennan’s handwritten notes state:
We’re getting additional insight into Russian activities from [REDACTED]. . . CITE [summarizing] alleged approved by Hillary Clinton a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisers to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.
On July 31, 2016, five days after Brennan’s briefing of Obama on the Clinton scheme, Comey’s FBI opened its bogus “investigation” of the Trump campaign and its alleged ties to Russia.
Consider the enormity of this: The Steele dossier, as it has now been incontestably shown, was put together by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, with the assistance of Russian intelligence. It was then used by not only Hillary Clinton but also her co-conspirators Barack Obama, James Comey, James Clapper, Nancy Pelosi, Representative Adam Schiff, the Washington Post,the New York Times,CNN, CBS, and all the rest of the Deep State cabal to vilify Trump, precisely as directed in the Clinton scheme outlined in Brennan’s briefing to President Obama. So, it is Hillary Clinton who is the Russia colluder.
Then Clinton and her campaign lawyer Marc Elias repeatedly lied and denied any connection to the obscene “pee dossier” — until documentary evidence forced them to admit that they had financed it. Then Hil-lary switched her tune and even defended funding the dossier. It was just legit “opposition research,” she told ABC News.
Audacious it certainly was, especially since the Clinton-Russia ties go far deeper than her collusion with Russian intelligence to produce the aforementioned “Steele dossier.” It was/is Hillary Clinton (and her husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, and their Clinton Foundation), not Donald Trump, that has all the ties to Putin and Russia. As we have reported in The New American many times over the years, Hillary Clinton had notoriously concluded a number of deals with Putin’s regime that materially aided Russia’s military-industrial-techological advancement, while simultaneously striking serious blows to America’s national security. Along these lines we could mention, for example, the Uranium One deal that gave Russia a controlling interest in our American uranium production, and the technology transfers that have helped build Skolkovo, Russia’s hi-tech Silicon Valley.
Of course, that was already known by the Deep Staters who were, nevertheless, pushing the Trump-Russia theme with a vengeance.
Those Spreading the Lies
Thus far in this article we have focused primarily on the Deep State’s coup efforts through the operations of its captive intelligence agencies. This is not to suggest that all or even most of the men and women who serve in the FBI, CIA, DIA, and other intelligence-community agencies are parties to this treachery. Indeed, it is due to leaks and testimony from many brave and patriotic employees who have risked their careers, reputations, pensions — and even their lives — to expose the crimes and treason of the political hacks who are their bosses, that we know about the fraud and lies.
The intelligence community wields enormous power, but it is only one facet of the larger Deep State cabal that has been attacking the Trump administration — and America — from every angle and on every level.
Working closely in tandem with the Deep State intelligence community is the controlled establishment media, whose indispensable role we have highlighted in an article on page 16. Together with the Big Tech social-media giants and search engines — Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Reddit, Yahoo, Microsoft, Bing, etc. — they are transforming American society ever more rapidly to resemble the totalitarian system of Communist China. Not only are they dispensing statist prop-aganda that more and more mimics the Chinese Communist Party line, but in true Orwellian fashion they are blatantly punishing “thought crime” with censorship, demonetization, deplatforming, bullying, doxing, and label-lynching.
Deep State operatives within the intelligence community and throughout the federal bureaucracy also collude with the anti-Trump/anti-American media to produce a steady deluge of strategically timed leaks, many of which involve classified material, and all of which are calculated to disrupt and cripple the operations of government. Like the Antifa street thugs, they may as well adopt the revolutionary slogan, “Make America Ungovernable!”
Speaking of Antifa, we should mention here the important role they and their comrades in Black Lives Matter are playing in the orchestrated coup effort. Their job is to provide pressure from below while Deep State operatives in government and the media provide pressure from above. The BLM/Antifa rioters would have amounted to nothing except for: 1) the massive funding they have received from George Soros and other globalists; 2) the massive media promotion and propaganda they have enjoyed; 3) the enormous boost they have received from radical politicians and particularly from mayors and prosecutors (many of whom are Soros-funded) who refuse to prosecute the rioters; and 4) the crucial leadership of hard-core Marxist-Leninists of the Revolutionary Communist Party, the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and other revolutionary groups. But, naturally, these things are never mentioned by the controlled media, which would have us believe the lie that the BLM/Antifa mobs are authentic, grassroots organizations.
Still another important element of the ongoing coup effort is the campaign to expand and empower the United Nations and all of its programs. President Trump not only has initiated action to withdraw the United States from the disastrous UN Climate Accord, but also has terminated U.S. membership in UNESCO, WHO, and the UN Arms Trade Treaty, which is a thinly disguised attack on the Second Amendment. Obviously, these and other Trumpian attacks on the globalists’ New World Order could not be allowed to stand. Then we saw the convenient unleashing of the COVID-19 “pandemic” upon the world by Communist China to wreck the rebounding U.S. economy, while pro-Beijing globalists such as Bill Gates, George Soros, and their confreres at the Council on Foreign Relations and World Economic Forum have cheered the moves by Western governments to adopt Chinese-style totalitarianism and “global health governance.”
As we go to press (on November 5) the official results of the election are still up in the air, though it is obvious that operatives of the Deep State have been active at all levels, and using all illegal means at their disposal, to steal votes from President Trump and throw the count to Joe Biden. As the decision over who won the White House gets thrown to the courts, we can expect that the BLM/Antifa mobs will also be unleashed into the streets. There also are crucial U.S. Senate and House races that remain unresolved. The outcomes of these races will hugely impact our nation, not the least of matters being whether or not we will see a packing of the Supreme Court, as many leading Democrats are calling for.

‘Livid’ Limbaugh confident ‘Trump is going to win this’,"(Natural News) With no official winner declared in the 2020 presidential race, talk-radio star Rush Limbaugh said President Trump would, in fact, win the election when the final results are accurately sorted out.
(Article by Joe Kovacs republished from WND.com)
“Trump is going to win this,” Limbaugh said confidently on his national broadcast Wednesday. “We did, we have, we’ve reelected Trump. … This doesn’t mean that I’m not livid, and it doesn’t mean that I’m not ticked off and mad like all the rest of you are, because I am.”
“Donald Trump was not repudiated last night. Donald Trump was reelected last night. Time will show us this.”
Limbaugh, a staunch supporter of Trump and fellow resident of Palm Beach, Florida, said, “We were winning big last night. … That’s why they stopped the counting.”
“When they stopped counting, it means they’re looking for Democrat votes. It means they don’t have Democrat votes. It means they gotta go find ’em. We are wise to their ways now.”
“Why is it that every state that is not a swing state run by Democrats can keep their act together on Election Night?” he asked rhetorically.
“The Democrats, I can’t tell you how depressed they are today that Trump was not repudiated,” he continued. “That’s what they really wanted to happen.”
He said the Democratic mantra of “Count every ballot” is not legitimate.
“‘We’re not going to count every ballot. We’re going to count every legitimate vote. It’s a big difference. … We’re gonna win playing by the rules, despite the fact the other side does not.”
Limbaugh also suggested Fox News called the state of Arizona too early and mistakenly for Joe Biden as personal payback by the network after Trump had publicly criticized the network on “Fox and Friends” this week.
“It’s personal. It was absolutely personal. But Trump’s gonna end up winning Arizona. … I think he already has. It’s just a matter of this playing out.”
“That Arizona call, the investigation of that … I think it’s gonna reveal some fascinating things that are going on in the bowels of the decision desk at the Fox News Channel.”
He called the outcome of huge support for the president “a devastating night” for Democrats.
“It was so huge the Democrats never saw it coming,” he noted. “These people are vindictive. They are single-mindedly hateful … They have been waiting, and they have been dreaming, they have been hoping, they have been planning on, they have been counting on you and every other American telling Donald Trump to go to hell yesterday — and that didn’t happen. … They literally thought Trump was going to be sent packing.”
Limbaugh said he talked with White House officials who say anywhere from two-thirds to 70 percent of Arizona votes are coming to the president, meaning that state could be counted in Trump’s favor.
Limbaugh urged his listeners: “The American way of life is going to be preserved. Keep the faith. The best days of our country are still ahead of us.”
“We want love and peace in our lives. We want our lives to be pleasant.”

Video: Deranged Olbermann calls for coup against President Trump,"(Natural News) In a venom filled online rant, Keith Olbermann called for President Trump to be dragged out of the White House immediately in handcuffs.
(Article by swatson republished from Summit.news)
“TRUMP HAS LOST HIS MIND AND MUST BE REMOVED, TONIGHT,” Olbermann tweeted, along with the video of him ranting on his online program literally titled Olbermann vs Trump.
“The coup attempt, we can survive. A mentally incompetent president, we may not. Instead, he will stay, and when he concedes he will simultaneously begin a campaign for 2024.” Olbermann stated.
Olbermann called Trump “President Karen” and a “lame duck president.”
TRUMP MUST BE REMOVED AND ARRESTED, TONIGHT. Gripped by a paranoid delusion, threatening the nation's safety, this can't wait any longer. It won't happen; in fact he'll probably concede and instantly announce he's running in '24.

Here is the full 10 minute mental breakdown, for those who can stomach it:
President Trump vowed last night to take the matter of election theft to the highest court in the land, noting “We think there’ll be a lot of litigation, because we cannot have an election stolen like this.”
Once a respected newsreader who espoused nuanced positions including opposition to illegal invasions in the Middle East, Olbermann is now completely unhinged, engaging in endless ‘orange man bad’ rants.
Last month Olbermann said Trump should be executed over the handling of the coronavirus:

"As Trump ignores deepening coronavirus crisis, Biden calls for urgent response","(CNN)Joe Biden has spent these early days as President-elect pleading with Americans to pay attention to the relentless surge of Covid-19 -- with deaths averaging more than 1,000 a day in the past week -- as President Donald Trump continues to ignore the deepening crisis and touts the promises of yet-to-be-approved vaccines as his panacea.
The continuing power struggle between two men with diametrically different philosophies on how the US should handle the virus has left the nation rudderless at this critical moment -- forced by Trump into a governing crisis as he refuses to let the transition to the Biden presidency proceed and pass on knowledge that could be critical to slowing the spread of the virus next year.
This past week, some Republicans in Congress finally seemed to take note of how the President's blockade was threatening national security -- as Republican Sens. James Lankford of Oklahoma, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota, among others, stepped up to say that the President-elect should begin receiving intelligence briefings as is customary during the transition of power.
But there is no indication that top GOP leaders are applying that same logic to the deadly increase in coronavirus cases, even though the number of patients in US hospitals hit an all time pandemic high last week, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. As of Saturday, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized, according to the organization's tallies.
The President is still adhering to the same hands-off approach that led so many voters to reject his leadership on Election Day, inaccurately stating that the increase in cases is the result of increased testing as he tries to focus public attention on his administration's efforts to speed up a vaccine through Operation Warp Speed.
The President spent most of Saturday golfing and tweeting his baseless and debunked conspiracy theories about how the election was rigged, and driving by a crowd of his supporters who gathered in Washington to protest the election results on the basis of his lies and propaganda.
He barely addressed the virus on Twitter Saturday, tweeting: ""Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!""
Amid that leadership vacuum, many doctors and top medical experts are bracing for even greater holiday spikes, noting that Americans have simply let their guards down and given in to the desire to return to normal life. The President unquestionably played a role in those attitudes as the administration abandoned its coronavirus task force briefings months ago and he tried to win reelection by advancing the falsehood that the US was ""rounding the corner.""
Given the complexities of rapid vaccine distribution and the potential for catastrophic consequences if doctors, hospitals and first responders don't have what they need to handle the current rise in Covid-19 cases, Democrats -- and even some Republicans from past administrations -- are sounding the alarm about the need for more communication between the outgoing and incoming administrations in this grave moment of national crisis.
""We have a president who has gone AWOL,"" said Leon Panetta, who served as White House chief of staff under former President Bill Clinton and as CIA director and secretary of defense under former President Barack Obama. ""AWOL from the election and its results, AWOL from Covid-19 and the impact it's having, AWOL from the transition and frankly AWOL from the presidency.""
""That has created a dangerous moment here,"" Panetta told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Saturday night on ""The Situation Room.""
Trump is blocking any meaningful exchange of coronavirus information -- beginning with the refusal of his appointee at the General Services Administration to ascertain the election, the first step that would allow the flow of transition funds and streamlined background checks for incoming staff.
That's forced the Biden team to get up to speed on the pandemic response by back-channeling with governors, members of the private sector and the medical community as they try to shape the nation's coronavirus response plan for next year.
While Biden is publicly projecting calm about the governing crisis — allowing the Trump campaign's election challenges to work their way through the courts, where they are amassing a growing string of defeats — he called for ""urgent action"" Friday by the Trump administration, including an acknowledgment of how serious the current Covid-19 situation is.
""This crisis demands a robust and immediate federal response, which has been woefully lacking. I am the president-elect, but I will not be president until next year,"" Biden said, underscoring the limitations of his position. ""The crisis does not respect dates on the calendar, it is accelerating right now.... Right now is a moment for shared responsibility and shared action. Together, we have the power to rein in this virus. And I promise you, from the moment I am sworn in on January 20, I will do everything in my power to lead this unified national effort.""
The President-elect's advisers have been increasingly vocal about their concerns about the lack of information sharing between the current and future administrations.
""This is truly a national security threat,"" Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist, epidemiologist and Biden Transition Covid-19 board member, said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" Friday evening. ""I cannot even imagine another situation — if we were in the midst of a war — that you wouldn't have handoff of information and plans to a succeeding president.""
As the US smashed through another set of coronavirus records on Friday evening, Dr. Vivek Murthy, co-chair of Biden's transition coronavirus advisory board, told Blitzer it was ""a grim day for the country.""
""We're at a point now, even pre-Thanksgiving, where we are surging beyond any level that we have seen over the last eight months,"" Murthy, a former surgeon general under President Barack Obama, said on ""The Situation Room."" ""What we do over these next few weeks is going to have a profound impact on whether this spread increases or whether we ultimately control the spread of this virus.""
In the absence of a vigorous federal response, local leaders are once again considering more dramatic action to control the spread, which could create major economic and logistical disruptions.
The 2.4% test positivity rate in New York City is now close enough to the 3% threshold that could lead the city to close schools and transition students to remote learning, a possibility that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo discussed during a call with journalists Saturday where he added that some schools might be able to ""test out"" of closures if they have a much lower positivity rate than the surrounding area.
The resurgence in Oregon, where cases topped more than 1,000 a day for the third day in a row Saturday, led Gov. Kate Brown to announce a ""two week freeze"" on Friday that will limit social gatherings to six people and two households, close restaurants and bars and place new limits on the number of people who can gather within faith-based organizations. The freeze will span from November 18 to December 2.
""I know it's hard and I know everybody is weary but we are trying to stop this ferocious virus from spreading,"" Brown said.
In Los Angeles, where cases have surged from about a 1,000 a day three weeks ago to nearly 4,000 on Saturday, according Mayor Eric Garcetti, officials created the largest testing center in America at Dodger Stadium — ushering some 8,000 people through the testing regimen on a single day this past week.
On Saturday, the Navajo Nation ordered a new three-week stay-at-home lockdown, restricting travel and only allowing residents to leave their homes for emergencies or to pick up groceries, medicine and firewood.
""We are inching closer and closer to a major public health crisis in which we could potentially see our hospitals filling up with patients,"" Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in a statement. ""Our health care system on the Navajo Nation cannot sustain a long-term surge in Covid-19 cases. The safest place to be is at home.""
