"VACCINE SLAUGHTER: An estimated 500,000 sharks will have to be killed and harvested to create a coronavirus vaccine","(Natural News) In the rush to create a vaccine for covid-19, scientists will need at least 500,000 dead sharks over the next six months. The sharks will be slaughtered to provide vaccine makers with an oil called squalene. The squalene is a byproduct produced in the liver of sharks. Smaller amounts of squalene can be found in olive oil, palm oil, wheat-germ oil, amaranth oil and rice bran oil, but these aren’t reliable sources for wide scale vaccine production.

In vaccine science, squalene is combined with surfactant chemicals to create an adjuvant which is used to augment an immune response in vaccine recipients. Based on its chemical properties, squalene is an emollient, allowing for vaccine antigens and other chemicals to more readily absorb deep into tissues and cells.

The more potent an adjuvant is, the greater the chances that the vaccine antigen (attenuated virus) penetrates the immune system, generating an antibody response in serum. As the potency of the adjuvant is increased, so is the risk of vaccine injury. As the potency of the adjuvant is decreased, the effectiveness of the vaccine wanes, requiring more doses to simulate an immune response.

Moreover, the human immune system is prone to produce antibodies to squalene — an under-studied autoimmune effect that could have lasting effects on humans. Even though squalene is a “cleaner” adjuvant than aluminum salts, it is part of scientific process that bypasses the innate immune system, including surveillance proteins, surveillance microbes, mucous membranes, etc.

As vaccine dependency increases, shark populations suffer

The mass slaughter of sharks is nothing new; certain types of influenza and malaria vaccines already depend upon squalene harvesting from sharks. As public health officials plan for wide-scale vaccination worldwide, the demand for dead sharks will grow exponentially.

The new covid-19 vaccines will not be effective after the first dose. The first experimental protocol requires two doses of the vaccine to simulate any sort of antibody response in humans. As this antibody response wanes, more doses will be needed in order to augment an immune response in humans. Some clinical trials suggest that five to six doses will be needed to keep human antibody levels up. This level of vaccine dependence could drastically affect the shark population.

Conservationist group, Shark Allies estimates that 250,000 sharks will need to be slaughtered in order for one vaccine dose to be distributed to the world’s population. If multiple doses are required, as evidenced by waning antibody responses in clinical trials, then millions of sharks would need to be slaughtered over the next three years.

Shark Allies founder Stefanie Brendl has launched a petition, demanding an end to the use of squalene in vaccines. She wrote: “Harvesting something from a wild animal is never going to be sustainable, especially if it’s a top predator that doesn’t reproduce in huge numbers. There’s so many unknowns of how big and how long this pandemic might go on, and then how many versions of it we have to go through, that if we continue using sharks, the numbers of sharks taken for this product could be really high, year after year after year.”

Vaccine production could ultimately endanger shark populations, only to make human immune systems dependent on vaccine science that wanes over time and puts additional pressure on the oceanic ecosystem.

"Moderna coronavirus vaccine causes side effects in over 50% of patients; antibodies disappear in 2-3 months, rendering the vaccine pointless","(Natural News) The widely-hyped Moderna coronavirus vaccine caused adverse events (side effects) in over 50% of clinical trial participants, including, “fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site.” While it generates antibodies in the short term, new studies indicate those antibodies fade very quickly, rendering the vaccine pointless in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

The side effects of the Moderna mRNA vaccine are documented in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a discredited, pro-pharma junk science rag that lies in favor of Big Pharma in every way possible. As published on Medicine.news, the NEJM was recently caught up with The Lancet in a junk science scheme that sought to discredit hydroxychloroquine through the use of fabricated data that was published in both journals (then was later retracted).

The new study is entitled, “An mRNA Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 — Preliminary Report.” It details the astonishing degree of side effects experienced by study subjects, revealing that over half of study participants reported at least one side effect. This chart, from the study, also shows that the side effects are dose dependent, meaning the higher the injection dose, the higher the reported side effects, further strengthening the causal ties between the vaccine and the side effects:

As you can see from the chart, 100% of study participants experienced side effects at the 100 ug or 250 ug injection volumes, during the second round of vaccination.

100% of study participants experienced side effects in the high-dose second round of vaccination

Notably, 100% of participants experienced headaches, local symptoms and systemic symptoms, while nearly 100% experienced chills, myalgia and fatigue, during the second injections.

This study reveals that the vaccine becomes increasingly toxic with subsequent injections, meaning even if the fist injection is relatively well handled by the body, the second injection can be significantly more dangerous.

Notably, with other studies now revealing that coronavirus antibodies fade quickly over the period of about 3 months, the mRNA vaccine from Moderna would have to be injected multiple times, perhaps as many as four times each year in order to maintain high levels of antibodies.

But with each injection, the vaccine becomes more toxic and produces more side effects. As the study authors conclude, “Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose…”

Even with side effects impacting all participants in the second round, study authors claim everything’s fine

Yet, to no one’s surprise, all these toxic effects of the vaccine that increase with subsequent vaccines are not called out as an item of concern. Given that the study authors are, of course, paid by Moderna to produce pro-vaccine propaganda in the name of “science,” they conclude that all the side effects are perfectly fine, stating: (emphasis added)

Across both vaccinations, solicited systemic and local adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Evaluation of safety clinical laboratory values of grade 2 or higher and unsolicited adverse events revealed no patterns of concern… These safety and immunogenicity findings support advancement of the mRNA-1273 vaccine to later-stage clinical trials.



Got that? The vaccine is increasingly toxic in higher doses and multiple injections, but it’s still awesome and should move toward production and widespread injections into potentially billions of human beings, despite no long-term safety studies being conducted whatsoever.

That’s the vaccine industry in 2020: Screw safety and science, just approve the damn thing and collect the hundreds of billions of dollars from governments buying your vaccine, even if it harms or kills millions of people.

Even when the vaccine invokes an antibody response, that’s not “immunity”

Note that the production of antibodies in the blood is not the same as “functional immunity.” There is zero evidence that this vaccine makes anyone immune to coronavirus infections.

And as Michael Snyder writes on EndOfTheAmericanDream.com, three studies have now found covid-19 antibodies disappear from the body very quickly, rendering antibody-producing vaccines practically worthless:

Scientific evidence continues to emerge that indicates that COVID-19 is going to be with us for a very long time to come. Yesterday, I reported on a recent study that was conducted in China and another recent study that was conducted in Spain that both showed that COVID-19 antibodies start to disappear very, very quickly. In fact, the study that was conducted in Spain discovered that some patients that originally tested positive for antibodies “no longer had antibodies weeks later”. Well, now we have a third study to add to the list. A study of COVID-19 patients that was conducted at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust in London found that “just 16.7 percent of the patients had a potent antibody response” after a couple of months had passed…

Researchers analyzed immune responses of patients and health care workers at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust in London and found that levels of antibodies that destroy the virus quickly declined after peaking several weeks after patients exhibited symptoms.

The study found that 60 percent of the patients had a “potent” antibody response at peak of their battle with the coronavirus. After about two months, however, just 16.7 percent of the patients had a potent antibody response.

As Snyder points out, this is a huge finding because it means that coronavirus vaccines will likely only work short-term. After perhaps 90 days or so, the vaccine “wears off” and the antibodies are no longer functional in the body. Even the presence of antibodies doesn’t automatically confer immunity, by the way. Again, from Snyder:

In addition, experts are telling us that even if a COVID-19 victim develops antibodies, that does not necessarily mean that individual has immunity. In an article that he authored for CNN, Dr. William Haseltine explained that “only 15% of those who test positive for antibodies make the neutralizing antibodies necessary to develop immunity”…

Not only do antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 fade, and perhaps fade quickly, studies have also shown that only 15% of those who test positive for antibodies make the neutralizing antibodies necessary to develop immunity in the first place. And not all of those who make neutralizing antibodies make them at high levels. Some of those infected make no antibodies at all.

In other words, even if the mRNA vaccine from Moderna produces antibodies, the whole exercise may be pointless for two reasons:

1) Antibodies alone don’t confer immunity.

2) Antibodies fade away in just a few weeks.

Thus, the Moderna vaccine — which the Big Pharma pimping mainstream media has been hyping up as the savior of humanity — is probably a massive medical hoax that will scam world governments out of hundreds of billions of dollars for a treatment that flat-out doesn’t work.

Worse than a hoax, this vaccine will clearly harm large numbers of people, given that 100% of study subjects are already experiencing adverse events in the high dose group, during the second round of injections. How toxic is this going to get during a third vaccine? Or a fourth? And is there any end to how many injections of the same vaccine will be mandated by a corrupt, criminal FDA, CDC and national media that makes all its editorial decisions based on the profit demands of the drug cartels?

Finally, keep in mind that globalists who also promote the depopulation agenda are demanding this vaccine be given to Black people first. So wait: Take a toxic vaccine that doesn’t work but that causes huge side effects, and line up all the Blacks to be human guinea pigs?

Sounds like globalists and the vaccine industry have a whole new plan for planet Earth beyond 2020, and it has nothing to do with halting the pandemic but everything to do with genocide.

Don’t you find it astonishing that while hundreds of U.S. corporations are lining up to claim “Black Lives Matter,” many of those very same corporations are the ones producing the vaccines that will no doubt destroy Black lives?",7/16/20 0:00,
RIGGED: Covid-19 testing kits were distributed years before pandemic was declared,"(Natural News) What motivated the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic at the time they did? How much of the pandemonium, governments’ lock downs and corporate control is an overreaction? How much of it was planned? Whose agendas do these lock downs and economic controls ultimately serve? Did you know that covid-19 testing kits were distributed before the pandemic was declared?

A group of 600 medical doctors gathered in Spain and called the covid-19 outbreak “a false pandemic” created for political purposes. Locking people down and convincing them they can spread infections they do not have is a tyrannical curse of oppression. These doctors urge other healthcare professionals, “the media and political authorities to stop this criminal operation, by spreading the truth.”

Why are human rights being challenged during a time of human need?

In September 2019, the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board released a report titled, ‘A World at Risk’ which detailed how the UN and WHO conduct system-wide training and simulation exercises, including one for covering the deliberate release of a “lethal respiratory pathogen.” Why did Dr. Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates go on record about an impending pandemic, long before one was declared? Why are both these men so adamant about vaccinating the world population?

Why are medical edicts being enacted with such punitive force and why is the public health response so focused on restricting personal liberty and controlling economic activity, in mere anticipation of infectious disease? Why is the state taking away personal rights, medical privacy and forcing PPE onto populations through fear and coercion? In October 2019, Bill Gates organized a coronavirus pandemic exercise in New York called Event201. The event focused on how everyone on the planet should be vaccinated. In order to achieve this goal, the population would have need to be conditioned to surrender their rights for the “good of all.”

Covid-19 testing kits distributed in 2017 and 2018

Are covid-19 testing kits strategically designed to produce false positives, to overstate the number of cases to justify government intervention and isolation of healthy people? The CDC owns not only the patent on the coronavirus but also a patent and exclusive rights to the testing methodology. Why are the covid-19 testing kits producing false positives in those who are not sick, producing false evidence to force quarantines on healthy people and to declare outbreaks that aren’t even real? Why is the medical fraud allowed to persist?

If covid-19 appeared in China late 2019, why were covid-19 test kits distributed worldwide, two years before the “pandemic?” The World Integrated Trade Solution database reveals that covid-19 test kits were sent to countries in 2017 and 2018.

After this trade information went viral, the World Integrated Trade Solution tried to relabel “covid-19” with an inconspicuous term, “Medical Test Kits.” In the world of trade, this level of vagueness is not permitted. Even though WITS tried to cover up the label, they cannot change the product code. “Medical Test Kits” has the same product code, HS 300215 and it stands for “Covid-19 test kits.”

Why has so much focus been put on faulty detection protocols while effective treatments for covid-19 respiratory illness is suppressed? Why are hospital systems so ill-equipped to help patient immune systems? Why are these questions not even allowed on social media, as Facebook unites with the scientific dictatorship known as the WHO and the CDC to control information?

Same adjuvant in swine flu vaccine that caused narcolepsy also being used in coronavirus vaccine,"(Natural News) Numerous drug giants, including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi, are busily working to develop new vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). And we have learned that an adjuvant created by GSK that was linked to causing narcolepsy during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic is also slated to be used in these upcoming Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines.

Known as ASO3, this adjuvant is part of a proprietary prophylactic technology developed by GSK in partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, that helps to make it easier for vaccine companies to roll out new vaccines in response to pandemics like the one currently said to be responsible for widespread lockdowns.

Back in February, CEPI announced that it had coordinated an agreement with The University of Queensland in Australia to begin incorporating GSK’s adjuvant technology into rapid vaccine production systems. And here we are almost six months later and that technology is about to be inserted into new Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines being developed by GSK and Sanofi, and potentially others.

“In theory, the adjuvant should cut the amount of antigen that is needed to create effective vaccines,” reported Fierce Biotech several months back. “That benefit, known as antigen sparing, is particularly sought after during pandemic outbreaks as it enables more people to be vaccinated using available antigen supplies.”

In other words, GSK’s adjuvant technology will allow technocrat eugenicists like Bill Gates the ability to rapidly roll out new vaccines much more quickly than normal, which is arriving just in time for President Donald Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” vaccine program for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

GSK says don’t worry about the safety and effectiveness of future coronavirus vaccines – it’s all good!

As for ASO3, this squalene-containing adjuvant, which also contains DL-?-tocopherol and polysorbate, was first used more than a decade ago in the swine flu vaccine to facilitate the rapid rollout of millions of new jabs. And before long, people who received the shot started to develop narcolepsy, sparking global concern about the vaccine’s safety.

Fast-forward to today and this vaccine, known as Pandemrix, is still the subject of considerable controversy over the untold number of lives that were harmed or killed by its use. While GSK claims that ASO3 is not to blame for these cases, the situation is still “unresolved,” according to reports.

“GSK, for its part, thinks the pros and cons support the use of the adjuvant, noting that assessments of Pandemrix gave it a positive risk-benefit profile and that there are reasons to think the risks are far lower with 2019-nCOV,” Fierce Pharma further reports.

“Though research remains ongoing, currently available scientific data suggests that the occurrence of narcolepsy in the context of the 2009/10 Flu pandemic was associated with a similarity between a protein in the wild type H1N1 virus and a human protein relevant in regulating the sleep cycle, an extremely rare coincidence. Because the similarity was specific to the wild type H1N1 Flu virus, it is unlikely to affect the potential development and use of future 2019-nCOV pandemic vaccine candidates,” a GSK spokesperson is quoted as saying.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that ASO3 was only used for the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and has not been used since. Should it end up appearing in the new Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, which appears probable, be on the lookout for a potential wave of deadly side effects, as well as deaths, stemming from its use.

Shocking numbers: Comparing COVID-19 deaths to abortion deaths,"(Natural News) I recently saw the headline from the New York Times about the deaths of over 200,000 Americans to COVID-19, and it got me thinking.

(Article by Katie Beatty republished from LifeSiteNews.com)

What does that number represent? How does this number relate to the number of abortions committed in the U.S. every year?

What I found was shocking, sobering, and heartbreaking.

My bachelor’s degree is in mathematics, so my automatic response was to begin crunching numbers. In 2018, a total of 2,839,205 resident deaths were registered in the United States according to the CDC website.

The current population of the United States is approximately 330,484,275 and climbing. One person is born every eight seconds, and one person dies every twelve seconds.[1] So what is the average number of deaths from COVID-19 following this model? As of the week of 10/17/2020, there were 208,633 deaths between February 1, 2020 and October 17, 2020 related to COVID. In order to get an accurate average, we have to take the total number of days. Adding up the total:

So then we have

Truly a tragedy and a sad loss of life.

But wait — what about the babies who are aborted and are not included in the 7,779 deaths per day figure?

The last recorded number that I could find for abortions is from 2016, where 623,471 abortions were reported in the United States. The estimation for the actual number of abortions in 2016 is 862,320.

That means that the number of babies who are aborted in the United States each day is almost triple the number of people who die daily with COVID-19.

Abortion has been legal, however, since the 1973 decisions of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, and COVID-19 has been around only since December. What do the other numbers look like? How many Americans have we lost already to this tragedy? How many empty seats are there at the dinner table because your son or daughter or brother or sister was aborted?

Currently, abortion in the United States is on a downward trend with the peak of the crises occurring in 1990. The number of live births is also trending downward. This does not mean that the number of daily abortions is insignificant. In 2017, 18% of pregnancies ended by abortion — in other words, 1 out of every 6 pregnancies.

But let’s look a little closer.

I compiled the number of registered births between 1973 and 2016, the reported number of abortions per year, and the number of estimated abortions provided by the Guttmacher institute.[2]

Total Number of Live Births Total Number of Reported Abortions Total Estimated Number of Abortions 169,287,799 45,269,156 57,368,870

169 million live births. 57 million abortions. An entire generation…gone.

Let’s find out what that actually means. Once numbers get into the millions, people start to get confused. Just looking at the congressional budget verifies that statement. In order to find the percentage, first, we need to figure out the potential number of live births. I found this number by adding the total number of estimated abortions to the total number of live births.

Next we find the percentage of abortions to that potential number of live births through division and multiplication.

Twenty-five percent of the population that was supposed to be born in the last 40 years has been aborted? Do you mean to tell me that for every three babies born alive, one was aborted?

This is madness. Insanity. This is wrong.

It doesn’t end there. The highest recorded number of deaths in one day because of the coronavirus was 2,909 people. The most abortions performed in the United States in one year occurred in 1990, when 1,609,000 children are estimated to have been aborted.

In abortion’s heyday, over 4,000 American children were aborted every day. That is one child every 20 seconds. Three children every minute. The COVID-19 peak comes from one single day, but this is 4,408 babies, every day, for 365 days.

It continues. In 1980, the ratio of estimated abortions to live births was 43%!

That’s almost half of all pregnancies! That is absolute craziness!

You can argue to me about fetal viability; your body, your choice; and how a majority of abortions performed are done through medication and in the first 12 weeks until you are blue in the face, but at the end of the day, you will still be wrong if you defend abortion. Every person has a unique genetic code from the moment of conception and is a unique person with rights, born or unborn.

Two hundred eight thousand six hundred thirty-three COVID deaths to 57,368,870 abortions is not even half a percentage point. So yes, our great nation is in a crisis. But the crisis is not COVID-19; it is abortion.

On this upcoming Election Day on November 3, remember what really matters. All of the people who have tragically lost their lives and their futures to abortion. All of the unique, unrepeatable gifts to society that will never be.

After all, there is a reason why the right to life comes first in the Declaration of Independence. If we do not have the right to life, all of our other rights don’t matter.

This Election Day, you cannot support Biden/Harris and the ticket of death who want to allow abortions up to the moment of birth because you will be complicit in the greatest injustice of our time. The loss of life that occurs each and every day because of abortion carries more weight than any other issue on the table and is truly the greatest tragedy of our time.

Finally, if you have had an abortion, there may be unresolved feelings. Please know that you are not alone. There are programs, like Project Rachel, all over the country that help women struggling with emotional problems after abortion.

NO SURPRISE: The five deadliest COVID districts in the U.S. are ‘represented’ by Democrats… and AOC’s is the WORST,"(Natural News) Democratic lawmakers and Democratic ‘leaders’ around the country have become the most vocal in criticizing President Donald Trump and his administration for the administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This virus has become the most politicized outbreak in the history of our country, and that is due in no small part to the garbage ‘mainstream’ media in our country — most of whom are nothing more than left-wing propagandists and hacks whose entire existence in the age of Trump is to destroy his presidency, no matter if the country goes down with him.

Because it’s become so politicized and because the media hasn’t reported on it honestly, Americans have no clue what to believe about it.

But here’s one thing that is absolutely true: Democrats are the most responsible for the proliferation of the virus and the resultant tanking of the economy because they are the ones keeping it down and keeping Americans in doubt about ‘the science’ surrounding the virus.

Oh, and one other thing: The party that most blames President Trump for the deaths as a result of the virus (the death toll has also been politicized, by the way) represents portions of the country where the most deaths have occurred. (Related: US reports first case of COVID-19 reinfection.)

The Western Journal reports:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez likes criticizing Republicans, particularly President Donald Trump, over their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Oct. 6, for instance, AOC criticized Trump for advising Republicans to hold off on negotiating a COVID-19 relief package until after the presidential election, given House Leader Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats’ radical partisanship during stimulus negotiations.

“What an anti-everybody agenda looks like,” the New York Democrat tweeted Oct. 6.

What an anti-everybody agenda looks like: The President & GOP are walking away from getting ANY COVID stimulus relief done, effectively endangering millions, after *they* themselves got COVID & enjoyed free socialized healthcare, so they can push through an anti-ACA SCOTUS pick. https://t.co/zIidL1d6Rr — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 6, 2020

“The President & GOP are walking away from getting ANY COVID stimulus relief done, effectively endangering millions, after *they* themselves got COVID & enjoyed free socialized healthcare, so they can push through an anti-ACA SCOTUS pick.”

Yes, well…now, onto some facts.

According to Harvard University’s COVID-19 Metrics for United States Congressional Districts project, the districts with the highest number of coronavirus deaths as of the end of September all are represented by Democrats:

5. New York’s 5th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks (in office since 1998): 2.60 confirmed COVID deaths per 1,000 residents.

4. New York’s 9th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. Yvette Clark (in office since 2007): 2.63 confirmed COVID deaths per 1,000 people.

3. New York’s 6th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. Grace Meng (in office since 2013): 2.90 confirmed COVID deaths per 1,000 people.

2. New York’s 15th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. José Serrano (in office since 1991): 3.08 confirmed COVID deaths per 1,000 people.

1. New York’s 14th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (in office since 2019): 3.09 confirmed COVID deaths per 1,000 people.

Now, it should be said that U.S. representatives are elected by district residents to go to Washington, D.C., and be their voice in Congress. They don’t run the individual districts; elected local and state leaders do.

Therefore, it would be more appropriate to cast aspersions for the high death rate — the No. 1 rate — for her district on New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats.

Or no one because it’s a virus and viruses spread. They just do.

But still, it’s “ridiculous” for the New York freshman lawmaker “to be lobbing grenades at anyone else” over their response to the pandemic, said The Western Journal’s editor-in-chief George Upper.

“Just as I would say that I don’t think Donald Trump has a heck of a lot to do with how many people are dying from COVID,” Upper said last week on “WJ Live,” the Journal’s new podcast, “I wouldn’t hold a representative responsible for that.”

“For AOC to be lobbing grenades at anyone else when that’s what her home district looks like is just ridiculous,” he said.

“The narrative on the left is that politicians are responsible for it as long as the politicians are Donald Trump. That’s the narrative from the left. It’s ridiculous,” he added.

Fact check: True.

"BOMBSHELL: Covid-19 isn’t a pandemic plan, it’s an EXTERMINATION plan for humanity","(Natural News) About a year ago, I gave a live presentation in Branson, Missouri, that is only now being made fully public. The presentation, shown below via Brighteon.com, reveals that the real master plan which led to COVID is actually an extermination plan for humanity.

Population reduction has been the goal all along. But where the globalists have shown their true evil genius is in their choice of creating a biological weapon with high transmission rather than high fatality rates. The virus was never very deadly to people under the age of 50, but it was always highly contagious to people of all ages. And that contagiousness, it turns out, was enough to advance their nefarious plan against humanity.

The rapid spread of the virus allowed the globalist-controlled media to claim “cases” were skyrocketing, thereby justifying weaponized lockdowns and a global rolling out of medical fascism disguised as “public health” policies. Based entirely on the speed of the spread of the virus, cities, states and nations of the world were able to achieve three key goals that represent the necessary precursors to global human extermination:

Crushing the existing human economies of the world, including food production, ultimately leading to mass famine, homelessness and total dependence on government. Rolling out new, Orwellian medical fascism laws and edicts that set the precedent for mass arrests and forced relocation into “quarantine camps” for those who resist. These camps, of course, are actually death camps and processing facilities for eliminating human beings. Forcing compliance with global vaccine mandates which will of course be used to achieve global infertility and accelerated deaths from diseases and subsequent infections. Whereas a pathogen could not achieve a 90% death rate on its own, the engineered pathogen (the Wuhan coronavirus) was able to be used to drive people into mass vaccine compliance, during which they can be directly injected with toxic substances, vaccine compliance tracking nanotech (quantum dots) and biology-altering mRNA sequences that literally hijack the body’s cells and reprogram them to produce whatever protein sequences are engineered into the mRNA vaccines.

Thus, globalists have simultaneously built a global pandemic prison camp combined with a mandatory vaccine obedience system through which they can repeatedly spread more infectious disease and promote accelerated deaths or infertility.

The end goal, as globalists like Bill Gates openly support, is the elimination of billions of human beings living today. Ideally, globalists seek to reduce the world population to about 500 million people, which is roughly a 94% reduction in the current human population.

The world you once knew is never coming back, because the globalists who run the world have other plans

Each day, more and more people are coming to realize that there will be no restoration of the world we all once knew. Globalists have no intention of restoring human freedom, economic prosperity and global mobility. Now, human societies are being deliberately crushed — even in the face of contradictory scientific evidence that shows lockdowns don’t work — in order to cause mass destitution and collapse.

Only through this planned collapse can the billions of people in the world be forced into subservience to the globalist depopulation agenda.

A key element of this is the Universal Basic Income (UBI), which has already been rolled out across America for the last several months, under the approval of Republicans, Democrats and President Trump. The UBI provides basic sustenance income to allow people to purchase food and stay alive, while CDC mandates prohibit the eviction of renters who can no longer pay rent. Through the UBI, the eviction ban and the pumping up of the stock market with Fed money printing policies, America remains under the false appearance that the economy is rebounding. In truth, these are all temporary, makeshift tactics to prevent millions of homeless from spilling out into the streets right before an election.

The real plan — about to be rolled out — is to tie UBI benefits to vaccine compliance and speech compliance. Only the obedient will be granted government credits for food, and anyone who refuses to take the new vaccine will be cut off from government benefits. This is a deliberate “squeeze” to force the sheeple into mass vaccine suicide by making sure they cannot function in society (or receive government benefits) unless they go along with the vaccine mandates, which are of course a global extermination program disguised as a public health program.

How vaccines will be used to exterminate billions of humans while amplifying infectious disease on a global scale

The mass extermination via vaccines consists of two strategies:

Lacing the vaccines with new bioweapons viral strains to ensure the continuation of the “outbreak” narrative. Notably, this only requires less than one percent of administered vaccines to be laced. Engineering the vaccines to cause a very high fatality rate upon exposure to a secondary future infection, in a fatal reaction called a “cytokine storm,” which is a hyper-inflammation event that leads to rapid death.

Thus, people won’t be dropping dead right away after taking the vaccines. Instead, they will seem fine until the next major bioweapon pandemic hits them, at which point the fatality rate will be extremely high (perhaps as high as 75% averaged across all age groups).

The next strain to be released via the vaccines will be COVID-21, and the COVID-21 strain could be rightly considered the second half of a binary weapon system that will achieve extremely high kill rates for human beings across the globe.

Importantly, the mass die-offs will further justify government lockdowns, quarantines and medical authoritarianism that grants governments the power to forcefully inject people, kidnap people, imprison people and even exterminate people at will. The mass hysteria from the sudden wave of deaths will also feed directly into the justification of increased censorship by the tech giants, which will de-platform anyone who discusses the truth about how this entire scheme was planned from the start.

What ends up being created is a feedback loop of death, hysteria and tyranny. The more people die, the more hysteria the media spreads and the more tyranny is justified by the state. This, in turn, results in higher numbers of vaccine injections, which spread more weaponized viral strains, resulting in another wave of hysteria and so on. It’s the perfect scam of tyranny and depopulation: The very governments who are building the bioweapons are using them to exterminate the masses while using the infections to justify their own power to administer the extermination weapons (i.e. vaccines).

Government tyrants are giggling with joy with their newfound powers over life and death

YouTube has just recently confirmed it will ban all vaccine videos that don’t toe the line of Big Pharma and the China-run WHO. We’ve all witnessed the accelerating purges of so-called “anti-vax” channels and speakers across all the major tech platforms. It’s all part of the narrative control that will maintain information monopolies to keep pushing the vaccines, lockdowns and tyranny that’s killing human beings by the billions.

This is how they pull it off! It’s not the pandemic that’s really killing people; it’s the governments. And any who don’t surrender to the tyranny will be singled out as “threats” to public health, then silenced or forcibly removed.

Victoria, Australia has already beta tested these programs and has found a shocking degree of compliance among the population that’s targeted for extermination. New Zealand has also discovered shockingly high levels of compliance, and Canada is finding much the same thing. As it turns out, “progressive” societies are filled with eager-to-obey sheeple who maintain irrational faith and trust in government — the very same government that’s preparing them all to be terminated.

Resistance groups are growing all around the world, including in America where local economies (in conservative states) have fared relatively well by avoiding the punitive lockdowns that now characterize left-leaning cities and states.

This is the reason the globalists are working desperately to remove President Trump from power: Trump and his followers are the last remaining defenses for humanity, standing up against the anti-human forces of tyranny and destruction that built the coronavirus bioweapon in the first place (and released it on purpose, then lied about it). Thus, Trump must be removed from power at all costs, and his followers and supporters must be silenced, criminalized, smeared and eliminated at all costs as well. No pro-human voice that resists the COVID-21 tyranny scheme may be allowed to exist, or the entire plan could be placed in jeopardy because it requires broad voluntary compliance of the sheeple who are being culled. The minute the sheeple wake up and realize they are being led to the slaughter, they might not follow orders so easily.

How billions of humans will line up and beg to be “suicided” with vaccines

Rational people can process most of what I’ve described above, if they do the research and aren’t brain damaged from fluoride, pesticides, heavy metals and 5G. But now we bring in a topic where many people just can’t fathom the reality: Earth’s globalists are following orders from non-human entities.

Different people describe these non-human, non-Earth entities in different ways. To some people, they are demons of supernatural origin. To others, they are aliens of extraterrestrial origin. Still others say they are AI systems from advanced civilizations across the cosmos, and another explanation describes these influencing entities as interdimensional beings from a parallel universe. (Interesting note: CERN scientists have announced they are preparing to power up CERN to literally “make contact with a parallel universe,” according to mainstream media headlines.)

Whatever you call it, there exist non-human influences that seek to utterly eliminate the human race and cleanse planet Earth of humans. By some accounts, globalists have even been handed exotic technologies — such as genetic engineering tech, nanotech or anti-matter energy tech — to help achieve these goals in an efficient manner.

In essence, globalists have been commanded to eliminate most human beings in the most efficient manner possible, and it turns out that the most efficient way to achieve that is to convince humans to commit medical suicide. (i.e. line up and beg for vaccines). It’s actually much more work to try to exterminate human beings by force, because they will resist with force. But if you can roll out a global pandemic, crush the world’s economies, enslave the people while driving them all bankrupt and then demand their obedience to a medical police state, those very same people you are trying to eliminate will line up and beg to be “suicided” with vaccines.

And that’s precisely how this is being accomplished. Under the Trump administration, this program is called “Operation Warp Speed,” but Trump himself isn’t on board with the final solution, we believe. Rather, he’s playing along for other reasons, such as using the operation to strategically place military personnel in cities across America in preparation for a possible civil war uprising by Leftists.

But even the name “Operation Warp Speed” should be a red flag. Translated into the real goals of the globalists, it would be called Operation Fast Kill.

Why kill off human with vaccines when nuclear weapons would be so much faster? Answer: Organism specificity

You might wonder why the anti-human forces don’t simply nuke the planet and eliminate humans that way. The answer is because Earth’s ecosystem has value to all intelligent entities, and they do not seek the ruination of this planet; merely the elimination of the humans who inhabit it. Whatever weapon they use must be deployed with organism specificity so that it kills only humans, not apes, monkeys or other non-human primates, nor other mammals.

This is why genetically engineered vaccines are the ideal weapon for the extermination of humanity: They are very specific to human beings and pose essentially no risk of harm to the larger biosphere.

The point is to kill humans before humans kill the biosphere

In terms of motivations for all this, many believe this effort is also aligned with the idea that humans are in the process of destroying Earth’s biosphere — via pollution, radiation, microplastics, ecological destruction, etc. — and that if humans aren’t eliminated, the planet will reach a tipping point and find itself plunged into a mass extinction event which might require millions of years of recovery time.

This argument has nothing to do with the hoax of “climate change,” but rather centers on the mass chemical pollution and ecological destruction that humans continue to unleash across the planet, with complete disregard for the long-term effects of such actions.

From the point of view of non-humans, humans have become a cancer to Earth, and healing the Earth will require removing that cancer (i.e. human beings).

In summary so far:

Non-human entities have ordered globalists to engineer a scheme in which billions of humans can be eliminated without much of a fight.

The Wuhan coronavirus was engineered and released to stir up mass media hysteria in order to justify the deployment of medical police state policies around the globe.

Human economies were deliberately crushed in order to obliterate economic abundance and make most humans economic slaves (refugees) dependent on government, taking away their individual liberties or economic options.

Governments will only pay benefits to those who agree to line up and get vaccinated with the “kill switch” vaccines.

The deaths won’t occur immediately, but upon exposure to the next pathogen being released in the binary weapon depopulation scheme.

Once the great masses of human sheeple have been culled, the non-human entities can engage the remaining human resistance forces and eliminate them in a mop-up operation, preparing planet Earth for post-human colonization and other applications. Those human globalists who aided in the extermination agenda will of course be betrayed and eliminated themselves. Bill Gates, in other words, will eventually wind up with his own head on a stick, too.

Watch the Oblivion Agenda lecture series to get the full explanation in great detail

In the following 4-part lecture, I reveal why Earth has cosmic real estate value that’s recognized by all intelligent civilizations, and why Faster-Than-Light (FTL) travel technology is ubiquitous across the cosmos. Earth’s location in the Milky Way galaxy puts it right in the thick of traffic from other civilizations, who have obviously watched the rise of Homo Sapiens and have no doubt sounded alarm bells over the nuclear weapons testing that humans have been carrying out since 1945.

Setting off nukes on your own planet, by the way, is sort of a cosmic-scale way to announce to the universe, “We are here, and we are infinitely stupid. Someone please stop us before we destroy everything within reach.”

Even aliens, you see, can’t change the laws of physics. Radioisotopic half-lives are the same, everywhere in the cosmos, and they can’t be altered when anything short of nuclear fusion or fission reactors. Once you contaminate a planet with radiation, that planet is a biohazard for millennia, if not longer, and this holds true no matter what life form you might have in mind for occupying that planet.

Thus, with humanity’s mass pollution of the oceans due to microplastics, combined with the Fukushima disaster and the impending structural collapse of the Three Gorges Dam which will unleash a wave of nuclear accidents that poison most of the Northern Hemisphere, observers who have been watching Earth have reached what they see as the point of necessary interventions to save Earth from humanity. It appears they have made the decision to initiate the extermination of humans.

Biological weapons use human tissue to replicate the weapon itself, allow the weapon to be race-specific and to focus its second wave of binary death on the most highly-populated areas (cities). It is no coincidence that cities are where lockdowns and vaccine compliance programs are being most aggressively announced as well. This is where mass compliance can achieve the most efficient mass exterminations in the years ahead.

How political upheaval and civil war play right into the mass extermination agenda

Within this framework of the mass extermination of humans, any geopolitical wars or civil wars that can accelerate economic destruction and the collapse of public health are viewed as aiding the larger goal of global extermination. Notably, nuclear weapons will not be allowed to be deployed for the reasons stated above (i.e. the pollution is impossible to reverse). They can, instead, be decommissioned after launch via exotic non-Earth tech which has already been deployed against ICBM tests.

But conventional, kinetic wars between nations will be encouraged, as will domestic wars. Anything that promotes chaos, death, economic destruction and the collapse of health infrastructure is seen as accelerating the end goal of global depopulation.

Part of the mass mind control of humans is to keep people focused on small, tribal differences (Republicans vs. Democrats, Black vs. White or China vs. the USA) rather than realizing all humans have been targeted for extermination, and that we all share a common enemy which is not of this Earth.

In less than 10,000 years, humans went from innocent, indigenous dwellers to insane, destructive, technocrats who threaten not just Earth, but every planet we can reach. As we stand on the cusp of interplanetary travel and colonization, it seems that our cosmic neighbors have decided that humans are a threat to the cosmos and must not be allowed to continue to exist.

Ending humanity, they believe, is necessary to save Earth. And this is the plan you are seeing rolled out right now.

Last year, I called this cosmic plan the Oblivion Agenda. I’ve even posted more podcasts and videos about all this at the website OblivionAgenda.com.

Here are the videos from the Branson lecture in 2019, during which I presented this to the world. I held them back for the last six months or so, believing most of humanity wasn’t ready to handle this information. I’m hoping that now, after the covid-19 wake up call for humanity, the human race might be ready to learn the truth and hear this information.

"Major lawsuits coming for political tyrants who used coronavirus to steal freedom, destroy lives","(Natural News) With regards to the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), President Trump has repeatedly warned against a “cure” that is worse than the “disease.” And now that “cure” is the subject of new litigation that seeks justice against the political tyrants who told us all that we had to hole up at home in a mask in order to “flatten the curve.”

The Außerparlamentarischer Corona Untersuchungsausschuss (ACU), also known as the “Corona Extra-Parliamentary Inquiry Committee,” is a German group leading the charge to sue the pants off of every politician and government official out there who decided it would be a good idea to force everyone to stay home for months on end, which destroyed many small businesses while decimating the economy and ruining people’s lives.

An international class-action lawsuit, which is backed by more than 500-and-growing doctors and medical experts, aims to remedy the pain and suffering that tens of millions of innocent people have suffered at the hands of authoritarians who demanded “lockdowns” as the solution to the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).

Led by Dr. Reiner Fuellmich, one of the founders of the ACU, the lawsuit demands tens of billions of dollars in restitution for those who lost their jobs, developed mental problems, lost loved ones to suicide, or who otherwise suffered immensely due to the deadly “lockdowns” that were imposed on most of the West.

These government-ordered lockdowns “caused the loss of innumerable human lives, and have destroyed the economic existence of countless companies and individuals worldwide,” the suit explains.

Dr. Fuellmich specifically calls out the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) hysteria peddlers who induced “deliberate panic-mongering” in order to implement “fascist totalitarian models” of governance that were hatched by none other than communist China, the dictatorship responsible for unleashing the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).

Children everywhere, Dr. Fuellmich laments, have been “traumatized en masse” by the lockdowns and mask-wearing, “with the worst psychological consequences yet to be expected in the medium and long term.” And in Germany alone, as many as 800,000 small- and medium-sized businesses have closed due to the economic fallout of such restrictions.

Lockdowns and other draconian mandates represent “crimes against humanity”

All of this was predicated by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) declaration of a “pandemic” back in March, which was fraudulent to begin with considering the fact that the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) is hardly the universal death sentence that those with a horse in the race have long claimed it to be.

“This corona crisis, according to all we know today, must be renamed a corona scandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages,” Dr. Fuellmich explains in a video that, naturally, was banned by YouTube – you can still watch it here on Bitchute, though.

Dr. Fuellmich further warns that the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests being used to identify “cases” of the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) are fraudulent, as even the inventor of the test, Kary Mullis, admitted that “you can find almost anything in anybody” using a PCR test.

Mullis died just a few months before the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) started making headlines, but the fact of the matter is that the PCR test is not a reliable indicator of anything, and can easily be used to perpetrate massive fraud on the masses.

“Under the rules of civil tort law, all those who have been harmed by these PCR test-induced lockdowns are entitled to receive full compensation for their losses,” says Dr. Fuellmich who, by the way, has been incredibly successful with past litigation.

“In particular, there is a duty to compensate, i.e. a duty to pay damages for the loss of profits suffered by companies and self-employed persons as a result of the lockdowns and other measures,” he says.

"Coronavirus vaccine trial subjects report extreme exhaustion, shortness of breath, day-long headaches and shaking so violently that one of them cracked a tooth","(Natural News) Get ready for the depopulation kill shots that cause severe neurological damage and lobotomize anyone stupid enough to take them. Even mainstream media outlet CNBC.com is now reporting that vaccine trials conducted by Moderna and Pfizer are producing extreme side effects in trial subjects.

“High fever, body aches, headaches and exhaustion are some of the symptoms participants in Moderna and Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine trials say they felt after receiving the shots,” reports CNBC:

Luke Hutchison woke up in the middle of the night with chills and a fever after taking the Covid-19 booster shot in Moderna’s vaccine trial. Another coronavirus vaccine trial participant, testing Pfizer’s candidate, similarly woke up with chills, shaking so hard he cracked a tooth after taking the second dose.

High fever, body aches, bad headaches and exhaustion are just some of the symptoms five participants in two of the leading coronavirus vaccine trials say they felt after receiving the shots.

CNBC goes on to explain that the study participants then claimed all the pain, “was worth it.” Worth it for what? For a pandemic that’s already over for people under the age of 70?

These are all symptoms of neurological damage occurring in real time

Here’s a more detailed description of the side effects reported by a pro-science, pro-vaccine trial participant:

After getting the first shot on Aug. 18, he said he felt a little under the weather for several days with a low-grade fever. He got his second shot at a clinic on Sept. 15. Eight hours later, he said he was bed bound with a fever of over 101, shakes, chills, a pounding headache and shortness of breath. He said the pain in his arm, where he received the shot, felt like a “goose egg on my shoulder.” He hardly slept that night, recording that his temperature was higher than 100 degrees for five hours.

After 12 hours, Hutchison said he felt back to normal and his energy levels returned. Having signed a lengthy consent form, Hutchison was aware that he might experience symptoms. But he was still struck by the severity and duration, tweeting on Sept. 16 that he experienced “full on Covid-like symptoms.”

Does this sound like a “safe” vaccine to administer to hundreds of millions of people? Full-on Covid-like symptoms?

What CNBC isn’t saying, of course, is that all these symptoms — extreme exhaustion, long duration headaches and violent shaking — are signs of neurological damage happening in real time.

These are obvious signs that a kind of vaccine lobotomy is taking place, causing permanent, long-term neurological damage to the trial participants (who may already be brain damaged to begin with, as they volunteered for these medical experiments).

Fascinatingly, CNBC also explains that some people are dumb enough to raise their hands and actually volunteer to be used as human guinea pigs for these insane medical experiments:

Hutchison, a 44-year-old computational biologist in Utah, said he signed up for Moderna’s phase three trial because he’s healthy, physically fit and a big believer in vaccines. He specifically wanted to support Moderna’s effort, as he was intrigued by the company’s RNA-based approach.

CNBC says Luke Hutchison, “signed up to a coronavirus vaccine trial because he’s ‘pro science.'” It’s almost hilarious, if it weren’t so tragic. Little does he know that the vaccine cares nothing about science but everything about profits, which means rushing dangerous vaccines to market through the use of human medical experimentation that will no doubt kill some people along the way.

I doubt Hutchison will be feeling good about all this with his nervous system starts to disintegrate. But to each his own… People who think vaccines are rooted in “science” are in for a very rude awakening.

“Pro-science” vaccine trial participants may be covering up side effects to protect vaccine companies

It’s also clear that these trial participants are now being used as public relations puppets for the vaccine industry, and that’s a whole new, dangerous medical propaganda agenda that we haven’t seen before. When the trial participants enter the trials with a “pro-vaccine” cheerleading bias, they are likely to downplay the severity of the side effects they experience, and this causes the vaccine manufacturer to improperly assess the real adverse events associated with the vaccine.

In effect, the “pro-science” human guinea pigs rig the trials by covering up for the vaccine side effects, allowing the vaccine manufacturers to achieve FDA approval for dangerous, toxic vaccines that may go on to injure or kill far more people than the pandemic itself.

At some point, we all have to say, “If these people want to commit vaccine suicide, let them commit vaccine suicide,” because there’s nothing you can say to stop them. If they want to sacrifice their own lives in the name of “pro-science,” then that’s their free will choice.

After all, somebody has to be among the first pioneers to take the kill shots. Why not let people self-select for that and win the Darwin award for pro-science stupidity?

"OBEY OR ELSE: New England Journal of Medicine says people refusing MANDATORY coronavirus vaccines should be severely punished, locked in their homes and fired from their jobs","(Natural News) Welcome to the new medical fascism of 2020. The New England Journal of Medicine, the same fake science rag that committed total fraud to dishonestly smear hydroxychloroquine and protect the interests of vaccine companies, is now saying that all human beings must be forced to take mandatory vaccines. Those who refuse should face severe punishment, the NEJM insists, and insidious measures should be pursued to make sure no one can challenge the punishments in a court of law.

Source: Ensuring Uptake of Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, October 1, 2020, N Engl J Med 2020; 383:1296-1299

“[B]ecause of the infectiousness and dangerousness of the virus, relatively substantive penalties could be justified, including employment suspension or stay-at-home orders for persons in designated high-priority groups who refuse vaccination,” says the NEJM paper.

It also states that authoritarian medical personnel should bypass due process so that no one can challenge their orders in a court of law, stating, “Neither fines nor criminal penalties should be used, however… criminal penalties invite legal challenges on procedural due-process grounds [and] may stoke distrust.”

It goes on to explain that vaccine mandates should not be promoted as mandates. Instead, those who refuse vaccines should be harshly punished as a way to force the mandates without ever declaring it. “[S]tate mandates should not be structured as compulsory vaccination (absolute requirements); instead, noncompliance should incur a penalty,” the paper states.

And then, incredibly, the same paper goes on to claim that health authorities must “build public trust” through a “transparent and inclusive process,” even though the same paper openly claimed the public should be misled and coerced into vaccine mandates.

To its credit, the paper does argue that vaccine manufacturers should not be involved in crafting public policy or pushing mandates, since no one trusts the vaccine companies anymore. (Amazing how quickly that happened, isn’t it?)

So the bottom line here is as follows:

The health authoritarians are pushing for mandatory vaccines, but they won’t call them “mandates.”

Instead, they will PUNISH you for refusing to go along with their mandates, making your life miserable.

They are avoiding any mandates that could be challenged in a court of law in order to bypass due process.

They then claim this is how the vaccine industry can “build trust” with the public by pretending to be engaged in “transparency.”

Thanks to covid-19 tyrants, the whole idea of “informed consent” is now ancient history across the medical science establishment. Vaccine promoters believe they are the new “Judge Dredd” enforcers of society, and they believe that their experimental concoctions, no matter how risky or dangerous, should be forcibly injected into all human beings. Those who resist should be severely punished, they claim, and they will punish you in a way that you can’t challenge in a court of law.

And the fake news media is 100% behind all this and will shame you if you don’t go along.

Watch the warning from Dr. Carrie Madej in a new interview from just a few day ago:

In effect, they are rolling out a “vaccine social credit scoring” system that demands your compliance

What you’re watching here is a vaccine social credit scoring system being rolled out across America, right in front of our eyes.

Don’t want the vaccine shot? You’re fired from your job.

Still don’t want the shot? You’ll be prohibited from entering grocery stores and buying food.

Resisting the vaccine mandates? Health “authorities” will lock you in your own home, making you a prisoner without ever hauling you into court where you might be able to offer a defense against imprisonment.

This is the new covid-19 / vaccine authoritarian tyranny, and it’s being rolled out right this very minute, right in front of you, all across America. New York has just announced a second wave of lockdowns, and no one is resisting.

The sheeple will line up for the slaughter, and they will not speak out or resist as they are bled to death in the name of global population control. Anyone stupid enough to agree to be vaccinated is too stupid to represent the future of the human race. They will be systematically culled with the kill shot. How else will the globalists achieve their goal of exterminating over six billion humans, after all?

"BOMBSHELL: Former Pfizer executive says covid-19 “pandemic is over,” so-called “second wave” based on fraudulent testing","(Natural News) Despite claims by Anthony Fauci and others that Americans should brace for a “second wave” of the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19), former Pfizer Chief Science Officer Dr. Mike Yeadon says this is nothing but fear-mongering based on junk science and fraud.

A former vice president at the pharmaceutical giant, Dr. Yeadon claims that “almost all” of the tests being conducted for the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) are “false positives,” a phenomenon that has already been observed in Florida. Dr. Yeadon also says that “there is no science to suggest a second wave should happen.”

Any “second wave” that comes along is completely manufactured based on fake “new cases,” Dr. Yeadon is further quoted as saying, responding in the affirmative when asked if “we are basing a government policy, an economic policy, a civil liberties policy, in terms of limiting people to six persons in a meeting … all based on what may well be completely fake data.”

“Were it not for the test data that you get from the TV all the time, you would rightly conclude that the pandemic was over, as nothing much has happened,” Dr. Yeadon further stated, noting that more people will probably be admitted to hospitals for influenza in the coming months, but that these should not be mistaken as Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) admissions.

Be sure to check out the following video from Brighteon.com in which Dr. Yeadon talks to interviewer Julia Hartley-Brewer about the truth concerning the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) plandemic:

Dr. Yeadon published a paper suggesting that the “curve” was “flattened” months ago

Earlier this month, Dr. Yeadon and his colleagues published a paper they co-authored about the so-called “pandemic.” Entitled, “How Likely is a Second Wave?” this paper explains that most of the deaths associated with the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) occurred back in March and April, and quickly tapered off in the months that followed.

By April, most countries, including the U.S., had successfully “flattened the curve,” though increased testing, most of which is fraudulent, continues to report new “cases” that those in favor of continued pandemic restrictions are using as “evidence” to push for endless mask-wearing, physical distancing and in some cases, lockdowns.

“It has widely been observed that in all heavily infected countries in Europe and several of the U.S. states likewise, that the shape of the daily deaths vs. time curves is similar to ours in the U.K.,” this paper reveals. “Many of these curves are not just similar, but almost super imposable.”

This is further reflected in the latest survival figures, which since the month of May have risen to 99.8 percent of infections – meaning only 0.2 percent of people who test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) end up dying at some point after being “diagnosed.”

This 99.8 percent survival rate is significantly higher than the one proposed by Fauci back in March and April when he falsely claimed that upwards of 6 percent of Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) patients would die from the virus – meaning Fauci incorrectly claimed that the novel virus was 20 to 30 times more deadly than it actually is.

“The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) value accepted by Yeadon et al in the paper is .26%,” writes Ralph Lopez for HubPages. “The survival rate of a disease is 100% minus the IFR.”

Concerning the allegedly “novel” nature of the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19), Dr. Yeadon claims that it is only novel in the sense that it is a new type of coronavirus. As it turns out, there are many other types of coronaviruses in existence, including four other strains that are freely circulating throughout the population as you read this.

“They all have striking sequence similarity to the new coronavirus,” Dr. Yeadon points out in his paper, offering a different perspective that is rarely, if ever, mentioned by the mainstream media.

Virologists documents biological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created as a bio-weapon and INTENTIONALLY released,"(Natural News) Li-Meng Yan, the Chinese virologist who was censored off various social media platforms, has published a second co-authored report warning that SARS-CoV-2 is an “unrestricted bio-weapon” that was not only created in a Wuhan lab, but was also released INTENTIONALLY by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Li-Meng Yan worked undercover at the University of Hong Kong and in a reference lab for the World Health Organization before coming clean about the scientific fraud behind China’s bio-weapon release. She and her colleagues discovered biological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created from a template virus (ZC45/ZXC21) and owned by military research laboratories that answer to the Chinese Communist Party.

Virologists warns that SARS-CoV-2 was created as a bio-weapon

The paper exposed how the template virus, owned by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), was engineered over a six-month time frame to become SARS-CoV2. The paper reveals that Wuhan virologists went beyond gain-of-function research to engineer the new bio-weapon, and even used data fabrications to cover up the origin of SARS-CoV2.

The report also takes a closer look at the RaTG13 virus, which was allegedly obtained from bat feces in 2013. The sequencing of this virus, published at GenBank, has been compared to SARS-CoV-2 and shown to be 96 percent identical. Because of RaTG13’s similarities with SARS-CoV-2, the Chinese Communist Party has alleged that both are naturally-occurring viruses. The CCP declared that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 must be naturally occurring because they are taken from a fecal sample. Fecal samples are typically 70-90 percent bacterial; but these sequences were only 1.7 percent fecal matter. Furthermore, RaTG13 contains segments of DNA not just from bats, but also from foxes, flying foxes, squirrels, and other animals.

Since no live virus or intact genome has ever been isolated or recovered in nature for RaTG13, the naturally-occurring theory is dis-proven. Therefore, these two viruses are part of an ongoing line of virus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.

According to the paper, the process for sequencing DNA itself “leaves room for potential fraud.” The RaTG13 genome “could easily be fabricated.” Its entry on GenBank proves the viral genomic sequences and its associated sequencing reads are assembled and do not offer definitive proof that the viral genome is correctly represented.

The paper details how the RNA viral genome can be fabricated on GenBank with careful execution. After the genomic sequence is created on a computer, segments of the genome can be synthesized based on the sequence. After amplifying each DNA segment through PCR, the researcher can send the PCR products for sequencing. These may contain sequencing samples from an alleged host that are mixed with genetic material from the host, which is ultimately (fraudulently) used to determine the sequence of the virus from these “raw sequencing reads” which are then published on GenBank. This laboratory concoction, fused with a host and amplified, can then be used as false evidence to declare the virus to be a “natural-occurring” version of the corresponding virus.

Furthermore, the researchers took a closer look at the spike genes of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13. They found no evidence of natural evolution when compared to sequences of naturally-evolving coronaviruses. The report finds that the RBM region of the S1/spike of the RaTG13 strain had be edited in order to retain the 96.2 percent sequence identity. The report also finds that “All fabricated coronaviruses share a 100% amino acid sequence identity on the E protein with ZC45 and ZXC21,” a process that served as a template for the creation of SARS-CoV-2.

We must stop China’s bio-weapon research now and hold them accountable for war crimes

Because the genomic sequence is readily manipulated, what if the tests for covid-19 are unable to locate the precise genomic sequence? What if the vaccines currently in development do not contain the correct strain? What if multiple bio-weapon strains already exist, with various degrees of infectivity? What if China’s bio-weapon research is already ten steps ahead of the public health hysteria, and the CCP is preparing to unleash even more lethal bio-weapons? If China’s scientific fraud and bio-weapon research is not halted, then what’s stopping the rogue communist regime from unleashing a new bio-weapon every six months to stealthily perpetuate outbreaks that can be engineered to subvert detection?

COVID-19 vaccine trial participant DIES… AstraZeneca downplays the death and continues the medical experiments on the remaining humans,"(Natural News) A person who volunteered for the medical experimentation on humans with the COVID-19 vaccine has died during clinical trials, reports The Epoch Times. The death was confirmed by government officials in Brazil, where the trial was taking place, and the company whose vaccine is being tested in the medical experiments — AstraZeneca — says it will continue its experiments on the remaining human survivors.

No deaths will stand in the way of vaccine profits, it seems.

“The volunteer died on Oct. 15,” reports The Epoch Times. “It’s not clear whether the volunteer received the placebo shot or the vaccine.”

Had this person died in any other context, their death would of course have been counted as a “covid-19 death,” but since they are involved in a vaccine trial, the scheming mainstream media will claim the person received a placebo, not a live vaccine. Such claims are complete fiction, given that no such patient data are allowed to be released on individual patients. As TET reports:

The health authority noted that “data on clinical research volunteers must be kept confidential, in accordance with the principles of confidentiality, human dignity, and protection of participants,” according to a news release.

Thus, any media outlet reporting the vaccine trial participant was part of the placebo group is lying. Then again, all they do is lie.

The human medical experiments continue, no matter how many die in the process

“We cannot comment on individual cases in an ongoing trial of the Oxford vaccine as we adhere strictly to medical confidentiality and clinical trial regulations, but we can confirm that all required review processes have been followed,” said AstraZeneca in a public statement.

This isn’t the first indication of dangerous side effects linked to coronavirus vaccines. “It came after AstraZeneca said on Sept. 8 that its vaccine trial was placed on hold due to an illness in a patient in the United Kingdom,” reports TET. “The Food and Drug Administration placed a late-stage clinical trial from AstraZeneca on hold in the United States.”

Just yesterday, Natural News reported how Johnson & Johnson was forced to halt another coronavirus vaccine trial after a trial participant experienced an “unexplained illness.” As that story explains:

Johnson & Johnson is pausing its Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine trial after a study participant fell ill. The halt comes just weeks after the company announced that they were in the final stage of the trials.

In its news release, Johnson & Johnson said that the trial was paused in compliance with regulatory standards after the unnamed participant developed an “unexplained illness.”

In related news, nine people have died in South Korea after receiving flu shots there, causing a nationwide panic over the “death vaccines” that are killing so many people so quickly. As Strange Sounds reports:

Nine people have died after getting flu shots in South Korea in the past week, raising concerns over the vaccine’s safety just as the seasonal inoculation programme is expanded to head off potential COVID-19 complications.

Health authorities there are saying the vaccines didn’t kill anyone, since the dead people had “underlying health conditions,” which is exactly what Natural News warned would be said about vaccine deaths as the body count started to accelerate. Notably, when people with underlying health conditions die with a coronavirus infection, they are said to have died from covid-19. But when they have underlying health conditions and are found dead after receiving a vaccine injection, health authorities claim the vaccine isn’t related to their death.

How convenient.

Operation Fast Kill

It all begs the question: If human volunteers are now starting to die during the carefully controlled trials that recruit extremely healthy individuals for testing, what’s going to happen when these risky, rushed vaccines are unleashed upon the wildly unhealthy general public?

Operation Warp Speed is about to become Operation Fast Kill, it seems.

Then again, there’s no faster way for globalists to exterminate people who are too stupid to realize the covid-19 agenda is actually an extermination agenda targeting the human race.

On the other hand, those who are intelligent enough to want to survive should be steering clear of all vaccines and vaccine industry medical experiments carried out on humans. Obviously.

"President Trump and First Lady both test “positive” for COVID-19… doesn’t that mean Joe Biden and Chris Wallace are now infected, too?","(Natural News) President Trump announced late last night that he and First Lady Melania Trump have both “tested positive” for covid-19. According to his tweet (below), “We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”

But does this test result mean anything? We already know from numerous media reports — including the NY Times — that the vast majority of “positive” test results are false.

Neither President Trump nor Melania Trump are showing any symptoms of sickness, so they don’t quality as being sickened by the coronavirus.

Furthermore, President Trump is likely still taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure, which means his real-world risk of ever showing symptoms of sickness is extremely low, despite his age of 74.

This diagnosis is probably meaningless. The tests currently being used to diagnose “positive” cases are extremely unreliable and can be triggered by almost any previous coronavirus infection, such as a common cold type coronavirus.

In fact, nearly all the global testing for covid-19 is scientifically meaningless. Since there’s no science-based confidence in either the accuracy or specificity of such tests, they offer no useful information to someone who either tests positive or negative.

Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2020

“Trump had rallies scheduled on Friday and Saturday in Florida and Wisconsin, respectively, but it is unlikely that those will go forward,” reports Breitbart.com. But it seems pointless to alter the president’s schedule based on a test result that isn’t reliable in the first place.

Some users at Brighteon.social are speculating that the covid-19 diagnosis may be a cover for Trump going into hiding while he activates a military response against left-wing insurrectionists and deep state traitors. That’s pure speculation at this point, but it does seem like America is headed into a civil war / uprising scenario where the president will need to take extraordinary measures to protect himself and his family members from a deep state coup attempt.

Watch for deranged Leftists to now publicly hope that Trump will die from the infection, because that’s the kind of “death wish” lunatics they are.

In truth, President Trump is extremely unlikely to be harmed by the virus, because most covid-19 deaths occur among elderly people who are killed by ventilators or who suffer from numerous severe health conditions such as high blood pressure or strokes.

The real question here is that if Trump is truly infected, then did Trump accidentally infect Joe Biden since both candidates were screaming and spitting at each other during the recent debate?

And is Fox News fake moderator Chris Wallace infected, too, since he was sitting right in front of them while wearing no mask? Wouldn’t that be the most ironic story of the year if President Trump infected Chris Wallace with the coronavirus while Wallace interrupted him 75 times in 90 minutes?

Finally, Joe Biden visually appears to be in far worse health than Trump, so if Biden gets infected, he would seemingly have a much higher risk of serious complications or death. Then again, if Joe Biden disappeared into a lockdown quarantine, nobody could tell the difference, since he almost never appears in public anyway.",10/2/20 0:00,
Irrefutable: The coronavirus was engineered by scientists in a lab using well documented genetic engineering vectors that leave behind a “fingerprint”,"(Natural News) Every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists. The proof is in the virus itself: The tools for genetic insertion are still present as remnants in the genetic code. Since these unique gene sequences don’t occur by random chance, they’re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab.

But the WHO and CDC are covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China and its biological weapons program, since no government wants the public to know the full truth about how frequently government-run labs experience outbreaks. Decades ago, for example, the U.S. Army ran an Ebola bioweapons lab in the United States, where a monkey infected one of the scientists there. The strain turned out to be infectious only in monkeys, not humans, so the world dodged a bullet, but the U.S. Army “nuked” the entire facility with chemical bombs, killing all the monkeys and wiping out any last remnant of the virus on U.S. soil.

You can read the full details of that incident in the book The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. We’ve also covered it at NaturalNews.com, where this book description is reprinted:

In 1989, Reston, VA — one of the most famous U.S. planned communities located about 10 miles from Washington DC — stood at the epicenter of a potential biological disaster. This well-known story was narrated by Richard Preston in a bone chilling account related to the recognition and containment of a devastating tropical filovirus at a monkey facility — the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit.

That outbreak occurred because Ebola was found to be spreading through the air ducts, confirming that Ebola can spread through the air. This simple fact was vigorously covered up by the entire medical establishment during the Ebola scare in the United States many years later, where the CDC transported an infected patient to a hospital in Dallas, subsequently infecting a nurse who was treated with highly toxic chemicals that caused permanent kidney damage (she later sued the hospital for the damage she suffered).

The reason this is relevant is because in order to understand the coronavirus situation in China, we must first realize that virology research labs routinely experience lapses in containment. Even the United States has failed to contain deadly viral strains when trying to study them. China’s BSL-4 labs have experienced multiple accidental releases of SARS strains, and this new coronavirus is now confirmed to be an engineered strain that was either used in bioweapons research or vaccine experiments.

The genomic coding in the virus is not natural, in other words. Just as you would never encounter a snake in the desert that’s writing a book containing words and grammatical structure, the genetic sequences now identified in the coronavirus strain are, without question, proof that human engineers have been tinkering with the strain.

How to genetically engineer viruses: the pShuttle vector

One of the tools used to accomplish this genetic engineering is called pShuttle. It’s a genetic tool set that can carry a payload of genes to be inserted into the target virus.

Researchers engaged in genetic engineering can purchase the pShuttle sequence from online retailers such as AddGenes.org, which sells the sequence for $75, shipped in “bacteria as agar stab.”

The following map outlines the complete gene sequence of the pShuttle tool:

The method for using pShuttle is described in a PubMed document entitled, “A simplified system for generating recombinant adenoviruses.”

The summary of the paper describes, “a strategy that simplifies the generation and production of such viruses.” Here’s how the process works to achieve genetic engineering of viruses:

A recombinant adenoviral plasmid is generated with a minimum of enzymatic manipulations, using homologous recombination in bacteria rather than in eukaryotic cells. After transfections of such plasmids into a mammalian packaging cell line, viral production is conveniently followed with the aid of green fluorescent protein, encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone. Homogeneous viruses can be obtained from this procedure without plaque purification.

The paper describes how this approach will, “expedite the process of generating and testing recombinant adenoviruses.”

During this process, of course, the pShuttle leaves behind unique code, a “fingerprint” of the genetic modification. It is this fingerprint that has now been identified in the coronavirus.

As revealed by genomics researcher James Lyons-Weiler in this bombshell analysis article, the pShuttle genetic code is found in the coronavirus that’s circulating in the wild.

This is proof that the virus has been engineered by human scientists.

“IPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378,” writes Lyons-Weiler for IPAK:

Another gene sequence also shows a 92% match with the Spike protein from the SARS coronavirus:

The process for achieving this was patented by Chinese researchers as shown in this patent link.

The pShuttle vector was used to insert SARS genes into the coronavirus, a process that makes it deadly to humans. “The very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials,” warns Lyons-Weiler:

The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.

He also warns about, “studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals – rats, ferrets, and monkeys – in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus.”

He concludes:

If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.

Another doctor from Beijing Medical University warns the virus appears to be genetically engineered

Lyons-Weiler is not alone in his assessment of the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus. Dr. Yuhong Dong, who holds a doctorate degree in infectious diseases from Beijing University, writes in The Epoch Times:

Based on recently published scientific papers, this new coronavirus has unprecedented virologic features that suggest genetic engineering may have been involved in its creation. The virus presents with severe clinical features, thus it poses a huge threat to humans. It is imperative for scientists, physicians, and people all over the world, including governments and public health authorities, to make every effort to investigate this mysterious and suspicious virus in order to elucidate its origin and to protect the ultimate future of the human race.



Dr. Yuhong reminds us that a Jan. 30 science paper published in The Lancet concludes that, “recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus.” In other words, this did not occur through natural mutations in the wild.

He also points to a Jan. 27th study by five Greek scientists who also concluded the coronavirus has no lineage to other viruses in the “family tree” that’s found in the wild. He writes:

A Jan. 27 2020, study by 5 Greek scientists analyzed the genetic relationships of 2019-nCoV and found that “the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus,” and has an unusual middle segment never seen before in any coronavirus. All this indicates that 2019-nCoV is a brand-new type of coronavirus. The study’s authors rejected the original hypothesis that 2019-nCoV originated from random natural mutations between different coronaviruses.

“No bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market”

Dr. Yuhong writes about The Lancet study by authors Roujian Lu et al., from the China Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, repeating a quote from that paper:

First, the outbreak was first reported in late December 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV.

In other words, it isn’t from bats.

That means the entire mainstream media is lying to us about the real origins of the coronavirus.

That same paper goes on to underscore the misinformation in the official explanation, stating, “Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases—27 of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another—were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere.”

Both Lu (in The Lancet paper linked above) and Lyons-Weiler point to the presence of a SARS binding protein sequence in the coronavirus that allows it to easily infect human cells. As explained in The Epoch Times:

…despite considerable genetics distance between the Wuhan CoV and the human-infecting SARS-CoV, and the overall low homology of the Wuhan CoV S-protein to that of SARS-CoV, the Wuhan CoV S-protein had several patches of sequences in the receptor binding (RBD) domain with a high homology to that of SARS-CoV. The residues at positions 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 in SARS-CoV S-protein were reported to be at receptor complex interface and considered critical for cross species and human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV. So to our surprise, despite replacing four out of five important interface amino acid residues, the Wuhan CoV S-protein was found to have a significant binding affinity to human ACE2. …The Wuhan CoV S-protein and SARS-CoV S-protein shared an almost identical 3-D structure in the RBD domain, thus maintaining similar van der Waals and electrostatic properties in the interaction interface. Thus the Wuhan CoV is still able to pose a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S protein–ACE2 binding pathway. (emphasis added)



As Dr. Yuhong asks, “How could this novel virus be so intelligent as to mutate precisely at selected sites while preserving its binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor? How did the virus change just four amino acids of the S-protein? Did the virus know how to use Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) to make sure this would happen?”

It couldn’t happen by chance, in other words. The coronavirus is not a random mutation in the wild. It was engineered.

Many other scientists around the world are now investigating the gene sequences found in the coronavirus, and they are increasingly concluding that elements of the virus have been engineered.

Many of those scientists are being threatened and censored. One paper has so far been forced to be withdrawn and revised, no doubt to remove the key conclusions that point to the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus, but the proof of its engineering cannot be denied forever.

Brighteon.com/0bddc3da-f590-445e-ac38-9a74e358a57c

Either the coronavirus was genetically engineered, or the science establishment is going to have to throw out the entire field of genomics research and claim it isn’t real

Eventually, the science establishment is either going to have to conclude that this coronavirus strain was engineered, or that all the laws of genetics science don’t work, and gene sequencing is imaginary (sort of like transgenderism by the “progressive” Left, which has already abandoned biological reality).

So far they’ve tried to bamboozle the public into believing this is all some sort of accident from Mother Nature, but that has only worked because most of the public doesn’t understand enough science to counter the official propaganda. However, there are more than enough independent scientists around the world to prove that this pandemic strain was engineered by humans. More evidence is coming out each day.

Interestingly, as this article is going to press, all the official numbers of infections and deaths from coronavirus have been frozen for about 14 hours and counting, almost as if every nation of the world has agreed to stop reporting new numbers. This may be a temporary situation that gets resolved in the next few hours, but it’s highly suspicious. For the last week, we’ve been getting new updates about every 12 hours or sooner, and we’ve never seen the count frozen for this long.

At the same time, an 11th case of coronavirus has now been confirmed by the CDC in the United States, revealing that infections are continuing to spread in the USA, despite the efforts of the CDC to contain the outbreak.

"Can 5G exposure alter the structure and function of hemoglobin, causing coronavirus patients to die from oxygen deprivation?","(Natural News) Is 5G to partially blame for coronavirus deaths? Can 5G cause the blood that’s circulating in your body to be unable to carry oxygen?

What’s especially horrifying about the critical care of coronavirus patients is that they aren’t suffering from “viral pneumonia,” but rather from an inability to absorb or carry oxygen in the blood.

This has been confirmed by NYC ICU emergency physician Cameron Kyle-Sidell, who has released several videos detailing how coronavirus is not a kind of viral pneumonia. “We’re treating the wrong disease,” he says. And the ventilators are damaging the lungs of patients. He explains:

COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one. Rather, it appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most resembling high altitude sickness. Is it as if tens of thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at 30,000 feet at the cabin pressure is slowly being let out. These patients are slowly being starved of oxygen.

Watch him explain how coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen starvation, not from a viral pneumonia lung infection:

What this emergency room physician makes clear is that coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen deprivation, not a classic scenario of viral pneumonia. The patients’ lungs work fine, in other words, and the ventilators are actually damaging their lungs by forcing excessive pressure into them.

How does blood transport oxygen in the first place?

How, exactly, can all these patients be starved of oxygen when their lungs are technically working just fine? To understand one possible answer, you have to first understand how the blood carries oxygen. It’s way more fascinating than you might have supposed.

When functioning normally, 1 molecule of hemoglobin binds with 4 molecules of oxygen, using iron (Fe2+), forming oxyhemoglobin. But this binding is only achieved because of something called “partial pressure” which means the concentration of oxygen in the lung tissues is higher than the concentration of oxygen on the hemoglobin molecule (roughly stated, this is simplified somewhat), so the oxygen “leaps” to the hemoglobin in order to equalize the partial pressures across the chasm.

But 5G radiation alters the porosity of cell membranes, allowing some molecules or ionic elements to move more easily across those members, displacing other molecules (or soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide) that might normally make that leap. For example, it is well documented that 5G radiation causes “Voltage Gated Ion Channels” (VGIC), specifically with calcium ions (VGCC), causing cellular toxicity due to too much calcium entering the cell walls and poisoning the cells.

The research on this was published in Environmental Research — here’s the link — and reveals that 5G exposure not only alters cell permeability (porosity), but also releases peroxinitrites in the body. These are inflammation-producing molecules that ravage other healthy molecules circulating in the blood.

As described by Natural News:

A thorough review of the available published science on wireless (WiFi) and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) exposure has identified at least seven different ways that WiFi and EMF microwave pollution actively harms the human body.

Published in the journal Environmental Research, the peer-reviewed paper explains that exposure to WiFi signals, which are everywhere these days, can lead to: oxidative stress, sperm and testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG (electroencephalogram) changes, apoptosis (programmed cell death), cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload.

Note that coronavirus patients are already being observed with neuropsychiatric effects, testicular damage and oxidative stress, three of the symptoms of 5G exposure.

We just created this simple chart to point out the similarities between 5G exposure and coronavirus symptoms. Feel free to share everywhere, and link back to this article if possible:

Mass insanity due to psychiatric effects of cellular poisoning

We also know that 5G radiation and its effects on the cells of the body can lead to symptoms of insanity, hallucinations and even powerful personality changes. Interestingly, CNN’s Chris Cuomo already described bouts of hallucinations as he was battling the coronavirus, living in a high-5G city (NYC). As I wrote on Natural News last December:

5G radiation causes “neuropsychiatric” effects through a mechanism described as ion potentiation poisoning of brain cells, according to research published in Environmental Research.

This results in behavioral changes and even personality changes among those who are routinely exposed, researchers found. In other words, 5G is a weapon system that doubles as a telecommunications infrastructure, but the real impact is to damage human brain function and destroy rationality, reason and civility, especially among those who live in high population cities where 5G towers are becoming ubiquitous. That’s why you may have noticed increased insanity and widespread mental derangement in those areas.

Part of this effect may also be due to the production of peroxynitrites, which are generated in the body’s cells upon exposure to the voltage emitted by 5G radiation, which is beamed at your body in a narrow cone of high-intensity energy. (5G antennae focus energy in a tight beam that follows you around.)

We are already observing the coronavirus causing psychiatric effects, including zombie-like violent, aggressive behavior such as deliberately spitting and coughing on people.

How 5G radiation exposure alters the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen

Getting back to the oxygen question, the answer to why 5G radiation exposure may alter the function of hemoglobin is found in understanding the protein structure of hemoglobin itself.

Hemoglobin relies on something called the “heme group” which is a complex molecule with iron (FE 2+) in its center. This is surrounded by something called a “porphyrin ring” which is a cluster of unique structures (made of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen) that has a special affinity for other oxygen atoms. The ability for oxygen to “leap” onto this molecule in the lungs depends entirely on the structure (which also implies the ionic charges) of these complex molecules.

One thing to note in all this is that without the presence of histidine, a special protein, this heme group would have higher affinity toward carbon monoxide than oxygen, meaning the entire heme group would be occupied by carbon monoxide, blocking the absorption of oxygen. Thus, the histidine presence is critical for allowing the heme group to bind with oxygen. If you mess with histidine, you end up forcing hemoglobin to carry CO instead of O2, effectively creating oxygen deprivation in the blood.

This heme group, by the way, has special affinity for carbon dioxide, which allows the same molecule to carry CO2 out of the body’s cells and transport CO2 back to the lungs. Remember: The same hemoglobin molecule must carry both CO2 and O2 but at different times, and it must attract and then release those molecules at opposite times in order to rid the body of CO2 and nourish the body with O2. This is all accomplished with a delicate balance of proteins and protein folding.

The hemoglobin molecule itself is a miracle of nanotechnology. It transmorphs into two different structural states based on whether it’s carrying oxygen or not. In what’s called the “R-state,” this molecule is like a magnet for oxygen. When four oxygen atoms are bound, it becomes a highly stable structure (and appears red). Technically, the binding of a single molecule of oxygen (O2) increases the affinity toward oxygen on the three other oxygen sites, making the hemoglobin “mop up” four oxygen molecules very quickly. When it lacks oxygen, it changes to a “T-state” and appears blue, which is why low-oxygen blood has a blue color.

The important thing to understand in all this is that any alteration of the delicate structure of hemoglobin will impair its ability to bind with oxygen.

Take a look at the hemoglobin molecule representation above, from APSUbiology.org, and note the heme groups which are positioned in four places across the molecule. The polypeptide chains are part of the transmorphing structure of the molecule that allows it to carry and release both CO2 and O2, depending on the partial pressures of the gasses at different locations in the body (lungs vs. other cells). Note carefully that any change in the structure of hemoglobin will cause it to stop functioning:

Increasing the permeability of the hemoglobin molecule — i.e. its affinity toward other soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide — will “occupy” the hemoglobin molecule with the wrong substances, making it unable to absorb oxygen because it is not presenting in its “R-state” by the time the heart pumps the blood back to the lungs.

Stated another way, anything that significantly alters the affinity of hemoglobin toward other soluble gasses (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or even ionic minerals in the blood) could “shut off” the ability of blood to carry oxygen by altering its atomic structure.

If you change the structure of the heme group, it no longer functions to transport oxygen. Because in the case of the heme group, the structure is the function. Perhaps this can only be appreciated by organic chemists, but this heme group is truly a miracle of nanotechnology.

Here’s a diagram of how iron, histidine, the heme group and O2 oxygen molecules interact with hemoglobin, which alters its structure depending on the “oxygenated” vs. “deoxygenated” forms: (via Biology.Kenyon.edu)

Can 5G exposure alter the structure of hemoglobin by increasing its affinity toward other molecules which are not O2?

The real question in all this is best phrased as I have asked it above. I doubt that we are dealing with a phenomenon where 5G radiation exposures blocks the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen, but rather occupies the hemoglobin molecule with other elements that alter its structure and therefore its function, inhibiting its ability to bind with oxygen.

This is very likely happening all across the world wherever 5G is currently functioning, it’s just that the coronavirus is now exacerbating the symptoms and conditions to the point where mass death is occurring.

In other words, the coronavirus pandemic would likely not be nearly as bad if 5G exposure / radiation pollution wasn’t already compromising the structure and function of hemoglobin cells in the bodies of people who live in 5G cities.

This doesn’t mean the coronavirus isn’t real, of course; just that these two attacks on the human body have a synergistic effect of toxicity and mortality.

Conclusion: Humanity is committing suicide with 5G

While I strongly disagree with those who are claiming there’s no such thing as a virus or that the coronavirus is a hoax, I do agree that the widespread deployment of 5G antennas is a kind of suicide pact for the world.

Just as the Romans built their aqueducts out of lead linings and thereby poisoned their own citizens, driving them insane with load poisoning, the modern world of Big Tech and telecommunications is mass poisoning humanity with electropollution.

Right now, a lot of people are talking about the book, “The Invisible Rainbow” by John Kaminski, who believes coronavirus is an “electrical disease” and that 5G alone is causing all the mass deaths, not the virus. He writes things like, “The flu is not contagious” and “the quarantine is all a terrible hoax.”

Surely he is wrong on those claims, but he may not be wrong at all about the toxicity of electropollution and how 5G is actually a kind of “suicide system” that’s destroying humanity.

This all deserves a tremendous amount of additional study, but because we live in a world where Big Tech controls all the narratives and censors all those who question the safety of 5G, it now seems impossible for humanity to extricate itself from this mass suicide mission that has already been unleashed.

And that doesn’t even cover the topic of vaccines. What if Bill Gates’ vaccines are being deliberately engineered to contain toxic substances that 5G exposure will push into the cells, causing widespread death from “binary” exposure and subsequent cell toxicity?

It sure would be a simple way for Bill Gates to achieve his global depopulation dreams, all while administering a global IQ test that finds out which people are stupid enough to line up and be injected with a euthanasia weapon system.

"BREAKING: Researchers claim 100 percent cure rate vs. covid-19 in 100+ patient trial conducted in Ecuador, using intravenous chlorine dioxide","(Natural News) Preliminary data from a clinical trial involving more than 100 covid-19 patients in Ecuador has resulted in a claimed 100 cure rate within four days, according to Andreas Kalcker who is closely following the results of the effort. The tests were carried out by the Asociacion Ecuatoriana de Medicos Expertos en Medicina Integrativa, a group of integrative medicine practitioners.

Ecuador has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus, and the current “standard of care” promoted by Western medicine — largely based on the use of ventilators — has been killing the vast majority of critical patients while utterly failing to address the real root of the problem.

Covid-19 isn’t an Acute Respiratory Disease (ARD), it turns out. Rather, it often presents as an inflammation and blood clotting condition (see The Lancet research, below) which causes the blood to be unable to carry oxygen, resulting in patient hypoxia and eventual asphyxiation.

This is why intravenous chlorine dioxide — which immediately delivers a high dose of oxygen to blood cells — is believed to work so effectively against covid-19. It reportedly restores the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and clears the clotting in the lungs, all while destroying pathogens.

Chlorine dioxide researcher and advocate Andreas Kalcker has posted a video (in Spanish) where he explains the findings. That video, entitled, “Mas de 100 Casos de Covid-19 recuperados con CDS por medicos de Aememi,” is found at this link on Lbry.tv.

A video embed is offered here:

In the video, Andreas explains that researchers were able to achieve a complete cure in just four days through the use of intravenous chlorine dioxide (ClO2). Here’s a photo of some of the researchers holding syringes of chlorine dioxide, which is then infused into the patients’ blood, where it releases a wave of oxygen that researchers believe saturates the blood with O2 while killing pathogens:

Another clinical trial involving chlorine dioxide is currently under way, documented by the US National Library of Medicine at ClinicalTrials.gov. The study uses oral chlorine dioxide (rather than intravenous) and is entitled, “Determination of the Effectiveness of Oral Chlorine Dioxide in the Treatment of COVID 19.” The trial is being conducted by the Genesis Foundation and involves 20 patients.

The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for that trial is NCT04343742.

Andreas Kalcker explains in his video that chlorine dioxide is a powerful disinfectant that destroys viruses and bacteria. The substance has long been used in water purification processes and is approved by various US government agencies for as a water treatment and purification agent.

This video frame shows blood cells being flooded with oxygen from ClO2, instantly reducing clotting / coagulation:

Covid-19 is not an acute respiratory disease

In another bombshell science paper published May 7, 2020, in The Lancet, researchers Dennis McGonagle and others determined that covid-19 is not a respiratory disease but rather “diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy,” a kind of blood clotting that presents in lung tissue.

This explains why patients with covid-19 are dying from hypoxia (lack of oxygen) and are frequently killed by the use of ventilators. As an ICU doctor from New York warned months ago, doctors are treating the wrong disease. (That doctor’s YouTube channel was deleted and all his videos were censored, of course. No one is allowed to question medical orthodoxy in the medical police state known as the United States of America.)

Study authors also found the inflammation triggers a worsening of the condition, which implies that anti-inflammatory interventions might be the key to saving lives and ending the pandemic. From the study:

The immune mechanism underlying diffuse alveolar and pulmonary interstitial inflammation in COVID-19 involves a MAS-like state that triggers extensive immunothrombosis…

MAS stands for Macrophage Activation Syndrome, and it is an inflammatory response stemming from an over-reactive immune response, similar to the “cytokine storm” that’s being widely discussed (which vitamin C helps prevent, according to published research). As the study explains:

The severity of systemic inflammation in response to human coronavirus family members has features reminiscent of a cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), also known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH).

Figure 1 from the study:

To simplify these findings, covid-19 is not acute viral pneumonia impacting the respiratory system but rather an inflammation-based immunological response that leads to thrombosis (clotting in the lungs) which kills the patient. The use of ventilators only makes the problem worse, which is why previous observational studies have found that 88% of patients put on ventilators end up dying. They are dying because the ventilator treatment is the wrong treatment.

Chlorine dioxide is reportedly saving 100 percent of the patients studied so far because chlorine dioxide floods the blood with instantly usable oxygen while killing the pathogens responsible for clotting. There is also anecdotal evidence that some people are beating covid-19 infections with high doses of aspirin, a blood thinner, although this information should not be taken as advice for treatment, and far more research is needed on blood thinners and anti-inflammatory interventions.

This may also help explain why turmeric and vitamin D are associated with strong reductions in inflammation in the body, which may prove useful in balancing the immune response and preventing the kind of imbalance that can lead to immune system overreactions.

The criminal medical cartels are censoring all treatments and cures that work to save lives

Notably, the criminal Big Pharma cartels and corrupt government regulators (like the FDA, FTC, CDC) are going out of their way to try to criminalize or suppress any non-vaccine, non-pharma solutions that might save lives. Over the last month, we’ve all witnessed an astonishing level of aggression and mafia-style tactics used by the FDA and FTC against pioneering researchers offering a variety of possible solutions, from colloidal silver to chlorine dioxide and even intravenous vitamin C.

They’ve even declared war on hydroxychloroquine and the medical establishment has been engineering clinical trials which are designed to fail from the start in order to discredit the off-patent, affordable drug.

There is no doubt that Big Pharma’s obedient government lackeys are at war with truth and are desperately trying to suppress information about natural cures and integrative treatments that might eliminate covid-19 before vaccines can be made available.

The techno-fascist tech giants like Facebook, Google, Vimeo, YouTube and Twitter are all-in with Big Pharma, going out of their way to censor and destroy all information that criticizes vaccines or offers wisdom about natural treatments or integrative medicine interventions. This criminal cabal of Big Tech and Big Pharma is the enemy of humanity, as they are deliberately working to worsen the pandemic, increase suffering and death and extend the punishing lockdowns for as long as possible in order to cause several economic damage while preparing the masses for mandatory vaccines.

We are all witnessing a powerful criminal gang of corporations and regulators who are deliberately seeking to destroy human society as we know it today, and they are the gatekeepers of information on the ‘net (and in the news). This is why we are repeating our call for the CEOs of all the top tech giants to be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity, then prosecuted in a court of law. Over the weekend, a member of Italy’s Parliament gave a rousing speech in which she labeled Bill Gates a “vaccine criminal” and demanded he be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity.

Such efforts should not be limited to Bill Gates, however. They must include the criminals of other tech giants as well as the corrupt, anti-human criminals running the FDA, FTC and CDC, among others. Their crimes against humanity must not go unanswered, and they must be held accountable in a court of law.

The destructive, anti-human agendas of Big Pharma and Big Tech are incompatible with human freedom and a sustainable human civilization. These anti-human institutions must be permanently dismantled, and humanity must rise up against this threat in the same way we once awakened against the Third Reich and the rise of Nazi fascism and the Holocaust.

Right now, Big Pharma, Big Tech, the FDA and the CDC are plotting to kill billions of human beings with an engineered bioweapon, a risky vaccine, and high-fatality prescription drugs that make people more vulnerable to covid-19. These enemies of humanity must be stopped, and the truth about chlorine dioxide must be set free so that human beings can be saved from suffering and death.

To learn more about the establishment’s war on truth (and war on humanity), watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits, who has also been subjected to extreme censorship for raising the alarm about how vaccines are spreading infectious disease.

CONFIRMED: CoVid-19 coronavirus found to contain unique “gain-of-function” property “for efficient spreading in the human population” … exact quote from science paper just published in Antiviral Resea,"(Natural News) We now have bombshell, smoking gun evidence that the CoVid-19 “Wuhan” coronavirus was specifically engineered as an offensive biological warfare weapon, designed to target to exterminate human beings.

A new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Antiviral Research (Vol. 16, April 2020) is entitled, “The spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade.”

It reveals that the CoVid-19 coronavirus contains unique features that allow it to function as a more efficient weapon system for human-to-human transmission, which helps explain why the virus has been impossible to contain (even under “quarantine” conditions, which have universally failed in China, Japan, Korea and elsewhere).

As the science authors of the paper explain in the full text, “This furin-like cleavage site… may provide a gain-of-function to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population.” (Emphasis added)

Further, the science paper finds that there is no known viral ancestry to the CoVid-19 coronavirus, meaning it did not evolve from nature. It was engineered, and the science paper authors also state that the virus contains elements from MERS, stating, “Before the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, this important feature was not observed in the lineage b of betacoronaviruses.”

The abstract and full PDF (paid) of the study are available through this link at ScienceDirect.com:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220300528

The “smoking gun” aspects of this research were brought to light earlier today by Prof. Frances Boyle who appeared on the Alex Jones Show (2nd broadcast hour, Feb. 19th, 2020, InfoWars.com) to reveal his findings that confirm the Wuhan coronavirus was an engineered biological weapon.

Tomorrow we will publish the full transcript from that interview, containing stunning new details about the origin of the viral weapon. You can watch the full 47-minute segment here, via Brighteon.com. The full interview is also available on Banned.video.

Brighteon.com/b4e196ff-d85f-45c4-b4e0-8bc1bea6dc09

The following graphic from the published study shows some of the S-protein sequences found in the CoVid-19 “Wuhan” coronavirus which share a nearly identical pattern with MERS-CoV, but not with any previous ancestry of “lineage b” type coronavirus:

The new feature engineered into the Wuhan coronavirus has, “the potential to cleave specifically viral envelope glycoproteins, thereby enhancing viral fusion with host cell membranes,” conclude study authors.

This feature results in, “higher pathogenicity, pronounced neural symptoms and neurotropism in infected chickens,” according to the paper. That means, essentially, it kills more easily and causes nervous system damage while infecting nerve cells. Note that many of the human victims in China appear to suffer seizures and a total, almost instantaneous nervous system shutdown, literally collapsing in seconds.

Furthermore, this enhanced property of the virus results in, “a widening of the cell tropism of the virus,” meaning it allows the virus to live and thrive in a much wider variety of human cells, including respiratory system cells. This means the virus lives in both respiratory cells and nerve cells.

Interestingly, the study further confirms that “ACE2” receptors are the vector of opportunity for the virus to infect human beings, stating, “ACE2 is also the receptor of the newly emerged nCoV.”

Additionally, the study finds that another element of the CoVid-19 virus appears to have been assembled from the SARS coronavirus, further confirming Frances Boyle’s claim that the engineered weapon is a “chimera” of multiple strains of biological weapons, including SARS, MERS and HIV. From the study: “Notably, the IFPs of the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are identical, displaying characteristics of viral fusion peptides (Fig. 2).”

Engineered to attack the human respiratory system, but there may be a defense… (you won’t like it)

The CoVid-19 coronavirus is specifically engineered to exploit the biology of the human respiratory system. Again, from the paper text:

Since furin is highly expressed in lungs, an enveloped virus that infects the respiratory tract may successfully exploit this convertase to activate its surface glycoprotein (Bassi et al., 2017; Mbikay et al., 1997). Before the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, this important feature was not observed in the lineage b of betacoronaviruses.

Finally, study authors explain that people who have already been exposed to other viral infections may have enhanced immunity against the coronavirus. From the study:

…it was recently shown that in an effort to limit viral infections, host cells that are infected by a number of viruses provoke an interferon response to inhibit the enzymatic activity of furin-like enzymes.

Although we caution that this supposition is just theory (so far), it may turn out that one way to boost defenses against the coronavirus could be to get infected with a weaker respiratory virus first. Stated another way, people who routinely interact with the public and are exposed to a wide variety of in-the-wild circulating viruses may be automatically building improved defenses by overcoming other viral infections first.

This finding has huge implications for individuals who take vaccines, given that vaccines expose the human body to weakened viral strains that often fail to provoke the full response of “in-the-wild” viruses such as seasonal influenza. Although the research did not focus on this point, it might also turn out that people who routinely take seasonal flu shots could theoretically demonstrate a weakened immune response against the coronavirus, while those who avoid flu shots and allow their own bodies to naturally fight the flu each year will show enhanced immunity against CoVid-19 coronavirus.

Or, arguably, it might work the other way around, where people who routinely take more vaccines and are exposed to a wider variety of weaker strains therefore have more capacity to produce an “interferon response.” It’s too early to tell, but it certainly seems to be the case that people who are rarely or never exposed to other viral pathogens may be far more vulnerable to this one.

Refer to the “Hygiene Hypothesis” for more ideas on the ramifications of this research.

There’s more research yet to come, and tomorrow we post the full transcript of the interview with Frances Boyle on the Alex Jones Show.

What if the cure for the coronavirus were as simple as taking zinc?,"(Natural News) It’s now looking increasingly clear that zinc may truly be the “silver bullet” for stopping coronavirus infections and ending this global pandemic. This mineral is incredibly affordable, safe and widely available, yet no one in government or media is recommending that people take zinc, since it can’t generate the billions in profits found in prescription drugs and vaccines.

This article isn’t a self-serving promotion, by the way. We don’t have any zinc products to sell. Rather, this article is about helping save lives using nutritional solutions that are available right now. While nothing is yet clinically proven to cure coronavirus — although chloroquine seems promising in several small trials — zinc now appears to be the most promising nutritional substance that could help end this global pandemic and get people back to work so that the economic collapse can be halted.

Chloroquine works hand in hand with zinc, driving zinc into cells

The combination of chloroquine and zinc appears to be especially potent. A study published in PLoS ONE is entitled, “Chloroquine is a Zinc Ionophore,” and it describes how chloroquine drives zinc into cancer cells, making those cells highly vulnerable to apoptosis (cell death of cancer cells). From the study:

Chloroquine enhanced zinc uptake by A2780 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as assayed using a fluorescent zinc probe. This enhancement was attenuated by TPEN, a high affinity metal-binding compound, indicating the specificity of the zinc uptake.

Although that study was focused on cancer cells, we also know that zinc blocks coronavirus RNA polymerase activity, which is what the coronavirus uses to replicate. This paper, published in another PLoS journal, specifically talks about “zinc ionophores” blocking the replication of coronavirus in cell cultures: “Zn(2+) inhibits coronavirus and arterivirus RNA polymerase activity in vitro and zinc ionophores block the replication of these viruses in cell culture.”

From the abstract of that study:

Increasing the intracellular Zn(2+) concentration with zinc-ionophores like pyrithione (PT) can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including poliovirus and influenza virus. For some viruses this effect has been attributed to interference with viral polyprotein processing. In this study we demonstrate that the combination of Zn(2+) and PT at low concentrations (2 µM Zn(2+) and 2 µM PT) inhibits the replication of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) in cell culture.

More specifically, Zn(2+) was found to block the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis, whereas in the case of the SARS-CoV RdRp elongation was inhibited and template binding reduced. By chelating Zn(2+) with MgEDTA, the inhibitory effect of the divalent cation could be reversed, which provides a novel experimental tool for in vitro studies of the molecular details of nidovirus replication and transcription.

So we know that chloroquine + zinc drives the zinc into cells, blocking coronavirus replication. This is published science, not just a random theory.

It is very likely, in our estimation, that most of the people dying from coronavirus are zinc deficient. We need to be testing the zinc levels in blood serum of coronavirus patients so we can gather all relevant data and confirm this pattern.

Symptoms of coronavirus infections almost perfectly mirror symptoms of zinc deficiency

Writing for LewRockwell.com, Bill Sardi writes that all the most prominent signs of COVID-19 almost perfectly mirror symptoms of zinc deficiency. From his article:

…[M]odern medicine is so steeped in its pharmacy of prescription drugs, with its blinders toward nutritional medicine, that it can’t see the obvious evidences of a trace mineral deficiency that results in the same signs and symptoms produced by COVID-19 coronavirus.

He publishes this list of COVID-19 symptoms vs. symptoms of zinc deficiency:

He further writes:

Dr. James Robb, a pathologist who performed early experiments with coronaviruses back in the 1970s, claims that zinc lozenges are the “silver bullet against coronavirus.”

Zinc is required to maintain thymus gland function to produce life-long antibodies from T-memory cells.

Zinc supplementation in the elderly, the high-risk group of coronavirus Infections, lowers illness markedly. Modern medicine needs to emphasize zinc therapy, especially during epidemics.

In summary, it looks like zinc might be the single most important preventive measure, possibly in combination with chloroquine, to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and get the economies of the world back to work.

And that’s why the tech giants (Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) as well as the corporate-run media will continue to censor all truth about zinc and chloroquine, because they actively hope to spread this pandemic and collapse the global economy.

The best forms of zinc to consume as a dietary supplement are zinc gluconate, picolinate and acetate, by the way. Avoid zinc oxide, as it’s almost impossible to absorb.

Beyond manufacturing medical masks and ventilators, we believe President Trump should order emergency production of zinc supplementation, making it widely available (perhaps at zero cost) to the entire population. This could substantially slow the spread of the virus and potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives in the USA alone.

United Airlines preparing to segregate passengers who do not submit to rapid covid-19 testing,"(Natural News) United Airlines is getting ready to enact mandatory covid-19 testing for some of their airlines, to see how far they can push passengers into giving up their civil liberties. With this authoritarian move, the airline industry is participating in medical fascism, forcing medical decisions on passengers and stealing away human consent.

The covid-19 testing kits have proven to be ineffective, providing both false negatives and false positives. The false negatives lead to a false sense of security, and the false positives allow authorities to suspend the civil liberties of healthy individuals only to bloat covid-19 statistics and report false outbreaks. This well-documented medical fraud is not relevant to health authorities because their power and authority is derived from compliance, not accurate data and scientific integrity. Compliance is all that matters when appeasing the hysterical fear that healthy people are spreading infections they do not have.

People who don’t consent to rapid covid-19 test will be segregated, treated as lesser human beings

From November 16 to December 11, United Airlines will require all crew members and passengers over two years of age to submit to rapid covid-19 tests for United Flight 14 leaving out of Newark Liberty International Airport and traveling to London Heathrow. (EWR to LHR), departing at 7:15 p.m., Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

The tests will be free of charge. Anyone who does not consent to the testing requirement will be segregated from the rest of the passengers and put on a separate flight, as if they are “dangerous” vectors of disease.

“We believe the ability to provide fast, same-day COVID-19 testing will play a vital role in safely reopening travel around the world and navigating quarantines and travel restrictions, particularly to key international destinations like London,” said Toby Enqvist, chief customer officer for United.

Enqvist continued: “Through this pilot program, we’ll guarantee that everyone* onboard has tested negative for COVID-19, adding another element to our layered approach to safety. United will continue to lead on testing, while at the same time exploring new solutions that contribute to the safest travel experience possible.”

United Airlines is trying to see how far the industry can push passengers into giving up their civil liberties, body autonomy and medical privacy before the airline industry goes all in with CommonPass.

United Airlines negotiating with governments to give them more control over individual body requirements

CommonPass is a digital, medical fascist passport that will soon be required for travel. This digital passport, scanned at the terminal, gives governments the power to force travelers to submit to bodily requirements so public health authorities can monitor an individual’s covid-19 testing status and compliance to vaccines and other medical edicts.

United Airlines is in the negotiating process with governments around the world to lift travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines. Both of these overzealous, authoritarian measures are being used improperly, not on sick individuals, but instead to suspend the liberties of healthy travelers who have no sign of infection.

In order to get their liberties back, travelers will be coerced to comply with medical requirements pre-departure, and be forced to submit to all the bodily requirements put forth by each government, which will be monitored and scanned using the CommonPass digital passport. But because covid-19 tests are designed to always produce false positives, this stripping of human rights and body autonomy will continue, until all people are forced to take vaccines in order to make airlines “safe.” It’s all part of a plan, which Natural News reported on this past June 2020: Airline industry pushing for medical testing, thermal screening, digital IDs and vaccination passports.

United Airlines is stripping human beings of informed consent and claiming ownership over their bodies. It started with mask mandates and it’s moving forward with faulty medical swabs – only to end with mandatory injections of experimental vaccines. Human beings are being turned into slaves of a totalitarian scientific dictatorship which continues to inflict mental, social and emotional trauma while coercing human compliance to bodily harm.

China is using the coronavirus pandemic to speed up its plans for global DOMINATION,"(Natural News) A U.K. minister of parliament party warning that the Chinese Communist Party will achieve global dominance sooner thanks to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). This warning was written by Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader of the Conservative Party.

In an op-ed in The Telegraph regarding China’s rising prominence, Duncan Smith lamented the fact that, while China was supposedly on the road to recovery, the U.K. was getting ready to reimpose strict lockdowns across swathes of their country.

The MP further noted that the U.K. isn’t alone in this regard. The coronavirus continues to wreak havoc across most of the developed world, particularly in Europe and the United States.

China has been a notable exception to this rule. If their official pronouncements are to be believed, they haven’t had to deal with a large-scale resurgence of the coronavirus in a very long time. (Related: Beijing using the coronavirus pandemic to expand internet surveillance apparatus.)

In fact, as many economies in the Western world are going through a recession, China just announced that its GDP grew by 4.9 percent in the third quarter, and analysts expect the country’s economy to grow by 7.6 percent in 2021.

“There is a deep sense of irony here,” wrote Duncan Smith. “The country from which coronavirus came, and which did so little in the early days to help the rest of the world escape its spread, is now bouncing back by selling us the equipment we need to combat that very virus.”

China set to dominate the world through trade

Despite predictions that the coronavirus pandemic – coupled with the ongoing trade war with the United States – would finally shatter China’s economy, the communist regime is still standing strong.

In the first two months of 2020, Chinese exports contracted by an astonishing 17.1 percent. However, As the coronavirus pandemic started spreading across the world and demand for medical equipment, personal protective gear and appliances for people to start working from home such as computers and smartphones increased, Chinese exports received an enormous boost.

Duncan Smith points out that the pandemic has given China a trade surplus of $58.93 billion. The country’s exports have been increasing since June, and the yuan – China’s currency – hit an 18-month high before the communist government intervened to keep it more stable.

Many investors in the West are once again lining up and give the communist regime more of their money. In the United States, investors just gave the regime $27 billion in China’s first U.S. direct investment bond. Foreign Direct Investment inflows now amount to around $103 billion.

“China’s export performance during the crisis is indeed proof of its solid status as the world’s factory,” said Yao Wei, a Chinese economist for French investment bank Societe Generale. “It is reliable, as the quick and effective containment of the outbreak in China allowed its manufacturing sector to resume operations way ahead of others.”

Economic warfare is not the only way China is achieving its global dominance. Within its own borders, Uighurs are being forced into reeducation camps to have their cultural identities extinguished, Tibetans are being forced into labor camps, Mongolians are being barred from learning their own language, and its democracy-loving subjects in Hong Kong are facing persecution.

Outside its borders, it is currently engaged in a tense struggle with India over their borders in the Himalayas region, and it continues to solidify its grip over the resource-rich South China Sea. All this is not even considering the military threats it makes against democratic Taiwan.

The Free World can still fight back against China’s rise

There is a chance for the rest of the Free World to catch up. China has lost much of its early trade advantage as soon as lockdowns started getting rolled back in its rival trading partners. Chi Lo, a Greater China economist for BNP Paribas, believes that China’s export growth can fade as soon as world production goes back up to normal levels.

The strength of its growth is already being challenged by geopolitical tensions. When the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co., the country had to increase its imports from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.

For China’s emerging global dominance to be properly counteracted, however, Duncan Smith says the Western world needs to act quickly. To do that, it needs to stop pouring money into the country. If countries like the U.K. and the U.S. continue to do so, they may one day find themselves “ever more dependent on this authoritarian regime.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping has a clear vision for the future of his country, said Duncan Smith. They plan to be the world’s leading superpower in terms of economic and military might by 2049 – at the centennial anniversary of the country’s founding.

“All the while, President Xi Jinping’s ambition grows and grows. While coronavirus has turned life upside down for people across the West, for China the most significant effect is that it will achieve global dominance even earlier than its communist rules had planned,” said Duncan Smith at the conclusion of his opinion piece. “The only remaining question – when will the West wake up?”

"WHO: Lockdowns not the primary method for fighting COVID-19, governments must develop “better systems” against pandemic","(Natural News) An increasing number of doctors and other health professionals and experts, including members of the World Health Organization (WHO), are joining the call to warn policymakers against reimposing restrictive lockdowns. These medical professionals argue that the lockdowns do more harm than good in the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

During an interview with The Spectator aired on Oct. 9, WHO doctor and special envoy on COVID-19 David Nabarro said that the WHO no longer advocates using lockdowns as a primary means of keeping the coronavirus under control.

WATCH: Dr David Nabarro, the WHO's Special Envoy on Covid-19, tells Andrew Neil: 'We really do appeal to all world leaders: stop using lockdown as your primary control method'. Watch the full interview here: https://t.co/XLdaedsKVS #SpectatorTV @afneil | @davidnabarro pic.twitter.com/1M4xf3VnXQ — The Spectator (@spectator) October 9, 2020

“The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted,” said Nabarro during the online interview. “But by and large, we’d rather not do it.”

In an appeal to world leaders, Nabarro said that they need to stop using coronavirus lockdowns as their primary method of controlling the pandemic. “Develop better systems for [controlling the virus],” he said. “Work together and learn from each other. But remember – lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer.” (Related: No, “coronavirus” hasn’t thrown 100 million into extreme poverty… virus LOCKDOWNS did that.)

“I want to say it again: We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means of controlling this virus.”

Nabarro: War on COVID-19 will not be won by controlling people

In a different interview, this time with BBC 4, Nabarro warned the U.K. government against imposing another strict coronavirus lockdown. The WHO doctor argued that for the lockdown to work, the restrictions on social and economic activity cannot be forced upon the British people. These policies need to be popularly supported.

“This war – and I think it’s reasonable to call it a war – against the virus, which is going to go on for the foreseeable future, is not going to be won by creating tougher rules that attempt to control people’s behavior,” said Nabarro. “The only way that we will come out ahead of this virus is if we’re all able to do the right thing in the right place at the right time because we choose to do it.”

Nabarro believes that, without making it mandatory, people will one day come together and realize the importance of social distancing, the wearing of face masks, personal hygiene and quarantining when they get flu-like symptoms.

Nabarro’s current position on coronavirus lockdowns represents a radical shift from his previous statements. He has previously advocated for lockdowns. However, by September, he had moved to a more neutral position, arguing in front of the British parliament that the world was still at the beginning stages of the pandemic and that it will still take some time for health experts to properly understand how to fight it. By this point, he was arguing that lockdowns should not be discounted as a tactic.

However, in recent weeks, he said he has become “more and more convinced” that, despite the possible benefits to defeating the spread of the coronavirus, the economic and social consequences were too much for the world to bear.

Watch this episode of Brighteon Conversations with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he talks to Dr. Sherri Tenpenny as they both sound off against the stupidity of making the wearing of face masks mandatory.

There are alternatives to continual lockdowns

To understand the right way to fight back against the coronavirus, Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, says leaders should look to the example of countries that have successfully defeated it, such as Vietnam, Taiwan and New Zealand.

In Taiwan and New Zealand, sporting events are being held without any restrictions. In Vietnam, people can enter packed cafes and restaurants without fear.

In Vietnam and New Zealand, coronavirus lockdowns were decisive and quick. In Taiwan, a large-scale lockdown was never imposed upon the people. Yet, between these three countries, only 67 people have died from the coronavirus so far.

Sridhar has identified three key policies that governments need to put in place.

First, there needs to be an effective system for testing, tracing and isolating. Test results need to be returned within 24 hours to minimize the damage one person can do. There must be a proper system for contact tracing, with the goal of reaching at least 80 percent of a positive person’s recent contacts. People who test positive must also be isolated for at least 14 days, either at their own homes or at designated shelters.

Second, national health authorities need to act rationally and communicate their policies clearly, emphasizing encouraging personal hygiene and the wearing of face masks (without mandating it) and avoiding leaving the house as much as possible.

Lastly, governments need strict border protection. The coronavirus can be imported from overseas, and only strong border policies will be able to prevent that.

Top 5 Ways to HEIGHTEN your chances of catching Covid-19,"(Natural News) The science is in, and if you’re not already pretty much dying from cancer, diabetes or heart disease, then you probably aren’t going to die if you catch Covid-19. If you subtract all the deaths that were labeled Covid-caused that were not caused by Covid, what you’re left with is another viral flu, that went viral all around the world, killing off the already sick and dying. There’s no number we’ll ever see statistically that’s accurate, but many people who were labeled Covid death victims really died from MRSA, pneumonia, the flu, cancer, diabetes, heart attacks, strokes and of course, suicide. Yes, you can blame the fake news press for those. Wait, there’s more.

Besides all of those victims and non-victims of Covid, we are all told to think of the others, to be safe and wear a homemade bandana mask everywhere, maintain social distance of exactly 6 feet at all times, and only gather together if rioting in the streets to declare our hatred of Donald J. Trump. Otherwise, stay home, go broke and beg (vote) for a government that gives you everything for free, while removing forever all of your Constitutional rights.

It’s rather ironic that there’s “no cure” for a virus that can be killed by hand sanitizer and regular soap. In this rush to return to “normal” we should all consider very carefully what parts of normal we’re rushing back to. Nobody anywhere seems to have any common sense whatsoever. They’re acting like they’re being totally safe on one end, and on the other, the virus is having a free-for-all, penetrating the magical force field everyone thinks they’ve got erected. Like, don’t bring your own bag to the grocery store, but then the clerk touches every single item you just touched to put in the cart.

Think about this for a minute. There are 200 million Americans who get the flu shot every year, and get juiced up accordingly with deadly, brain-numbing mercury all the while. That’s just the beginning of why most people have zero common sense. Then, they eat what they see advertised on TV and the internet, with no regard to actual nutritional content or food that’s free from chemical herbicides and insecticides (plus GMOs). We’re talking about weed killer and bug killer chemicals that eviscerate the human immune system, repeatedly every single meal, snack and soda.

After a few years of that, they’re bound for their M.D.’s office, where they’re carefully and so thoughtfully prescribed chemical medications that solve nothing, except to quell the symptoms of a deep-rooted disease that’s festering in the gut, soon to travel through the lymph fluid to everywhere vital in the body. Those laboratory-concocted medications often come in the form of antibiotics, that wipe out all gut bacteria (good and bad), setting up the patient for death from a viral infection, like Covid, the flu, or certain kinds of MRSA staph-bacteria that are totally immune to antibiotics.

And, there’s more.

Filthy, bacteria-laden Covid masks are bad, bad news

The Covid masks everybody wears become filthy after a few days, trapping bacteria from the mouth and lungs in the body and in the material of the mask. Who’s washing these bacteria nets regularly, and who even realizes that the Covid virus is only 2 microns in size, where the holes in most masks are 3 to 5 microns. That’s like throwing a tennis ball through a basketball hoop. The masks don’t even work, in fact, they’re just delivering a cozy-safe feeling that enables more people to expose themselves even more. Oops.

In fact, according to a recent, in-depth study of Covid mask effectiveness, the penetration of cloth masks by particles was above 96 percent, compared to 44 percent with medical masks. That means not even medical masks are all that safe, let alone these crappy home-made, double-ply cut up sheets, scarves and ‘neck gaiters’ people are all wearing. And then they touch the mask repeatedly every minute to adjust it, rendering it not just useless, but now dangerous as well. There goes that safety net. It’s now a bacteria net.

The whole social distancing thing is a sham too. Also ironic is the fact that every vaccine pusher and fanatic has screamed for decades about herd immunity and how we should all stick together to help build immunity, but now everyone’s on lock down, where they don’t even get fresh air and exposure to bacteria they need to build immunity. It’s all backwards and inside out, just like the Democrats want it (yes, it’s political too, mainly actually).

The worst part of the whole mental “pandemic” is that the 200 million idiots who get a flu shot every year don’t know a darned thing about supplements, herbs, tinctures, superfoods, clean food or highly effective indigenous medicine. Their quack M.D.s warn them about natural remedies. They discourage them. It’s all about slash and burn allopathic nightmares that only stave off the inevitable. Surgery, tests, more tests, then chemotherapy and radiation. It’s “your best chance,” they say. At what? Dying from Covid?

Without further adieu, here are the Top 5 Ways to literally INCREASE your chances of catching Covid-19

#1. If you’re dumb enough to get a flu shot (or any CDC-recommended dirty vaccines for that matter)

#2. If you’re dumb enough to eat genetically modified food most meals (and processed sugar/canola oil)

#3. If your doctor cons you into taking antibiotic prescriptions for a viral infection

#4. If you think wearing is mask and social distancing is valid protection

#5. If you don’t supplement with vitamin D, vitamin C and zinc, especially as cold weather arrives

Airlines and transport officials CLASH with CDC over quarantines for airline passengers,"(Natural News) Airline companies and U.S. transport officials are clashing with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding whether people who test negative for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) should still be forced to quarantine after they arrive in the U.S.

Currently, official guidelines state that U.S. residents returning from Europe are advised – but not forced – to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return to the United States. European travelers are generally denied entry. Alternatively, Americans are barred from traveling to most European countries, with the notable exception being the United Kingdom, which forces them to quarantine for 14 days upon their arrival.

These guidelines are now being questioned as airlines, industry groups and senior transport officials look to strike deals with other nations and airline companies to establish what is known as a “safe-travel corridor.” This would involve two connected locations where people can fly to and from without needing to quarantine upon arrival.

CDC wants to maintain quarantines, but shorten their length

The CDC s arguing that, even if a safe-travel corridor was established between two cities, people should still be required to quarantine. That said, they’ve relented somewhat, and now only want to mandate that travelers be quarantined for between five to seven days, rather than 14. After the self-isolation period, however, the CDC still wants these travelers to take another coronavirus test.

Industry groups and senior transport officials, on the other hand, are pushing back on the need for further quarantining and testing.

“Quarantines don’t help achieve the goal of safe travel,” said industry group Airlines for America in a statement. “Rather, quarantines simply stop people from traveling or are not complied with.” (Related: In order to travel, you’ll soon be forced to carry a digital certificate that provides proof of medical checkups, screenings, DNA swabs, vaccinations.)

Airlines and other industry groups are pushing for an alternative system where travelers will be tested for the coronavirus before departure and will be signed up for a contact tracing system. One airline trade group is supportive of a 24-hour isolation period.

Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC’s division of global migration and quarantine, is one of the loudest voices calling for a one-week quarantine upon arrival. This, Cetron argues, would give the U.S. a 90 percent assurance that travelers will be coronavirus-free.

Despite his opposition to more relaxed rules for travelers, Cetron has nonetheless voiced his support for the establishment of a safe-travel corridor. He believes that it may one day contribute “to a safe, responsible and healthy global air travel experience, in addition to testing before and after travel and following public health recommendations on self-quarantine after travel.”

Discussions with the CDC are ongoing, and senior transport officials are attempting to mediate the dispute and find a common ground between the two parties.

Transport officials are hoping to resolve the disagreement very soon, as both the United States and the United Kingdom are currently in talks to establish a safe-travel corridor between London and New York. Officials from the Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security hope to open the corridor by the winter holidays.

Study suggests flying safer than grocery shopping or dining in restaurants

The CDC’s apprehensions with allowing the establishment of safe-travel corridors may be unfounded. A study released on Tuesday by the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health strongly suggests that flying may be safer than grocery shopping or dining indoors.

Researchers created computer models to simulate airflow in airliner cabins. According to them, the specialized onboard ventilation systems – known as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters – are able to filter out 99 percent of airborne particles, including those bearing viruses.

The researchers argued that, even if an airplane’s ventilation systems sucked in particles with COVID-19, the fact that they go through HEPA filters and because of the “downward direction” of airflow makes it unlikely a passenger will infect others.

“This ventilation effectively counters the proximity travelers are subject to during flights,” wrote the researchers in their report.

That said, the report also says that ventilation systems alone cannot guarantee a 99 percent reduction in risk. Effective air ventilation needs to be coupled with the wearing of face masks, regular disinfection and passenger screening for COVID-19 symptoms.

This “layered approach” makes flying safer than other routine activities, such as dining indoors in restaurants and grocery shopping.

The airline industry is already interpreting the study as a sign of relief, as they continue to face devastating losses from the pandemic and the lockdowns around the world making air travel impossible. Executives from United Airlines have already called the pandemic “the worst crisis in the history of aviation.”

The study is in line with another study conducted by the Department of Defense, who put particle detection equipment and mannequins wearing face masks on Boeing 767 and 777 aircraft. They found little risk of transmission, thanks in no small part to the efficient ventilation of air in the planes.

Big Tech now censoring all posts that question face coverings,"(Natural News) At the request of Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), the three major tech platforms – Facebook, Google and Twitter – will now be censoring all posts and content that questions the safety and effectiveness of the almighty face mask.

A full-fledged believer in the power of face masks to cure the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), Duckworth wants Big Tech to “counter domestic disinformation that spreads the dangerous lies such as ‘masks don’t work’” by preventing it from being shared online.

In other words, face masks are so safe and effective, according to Duckworth, that people cannot be allowed to express any free speech to the contrary because it might deter people from putting their faith in the religion of COVID-19.

Duckworth’s attack on the First Amendment comes as Silicon Valley faces yet another meaningless grilling from Congress over the immunity protections it still maintains under Section 230 of the antiquated Communications Decency Act (CDA).

Congress continues to pretend as though it will eventually do something to curb Big Tech from infringing people’s rights, but so far it has been all talk and no action, also known as business as usual, from the political overlords.

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Ill.) put on a lively show, however, as he sparred with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey concerning the platform’s unfair treatment of conservatives. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) also joined in on the fun by yelling at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.

“Who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear?” Cruz bellowed during the virtual hearing over Zoom.

“We don’t have a general policy around misleading information and misinformation,” Dorsey responded. “We rely upon people calling that speech out.”

In other words, Twitter does not actually have a standardized set of rules for what it censors, but rather relies on mob rule to make censorship decisions.

Is it really realistic to expect that Congress will ever put an end to Big Tech censorship?

President Donald Trump is also riling up his base about the topic by tweeting about it, ironically. Trump wrote in an Oct. 28 tweet that the media and Big Tech “are not covering Biden Corruption.

Trump added that the United States no longer has “Freedom of the Press,” but rather “Suppression of the Story, or just plain Fake News.”

“So much has been learned in the last two weeks about how corrupt our Media is, and now Big Tech, maybe [sic] even worse. Repeal Section 230!”

Again, we will believe it when we see it because this has been getting talked about for years by Republicans, which have collectively and individually done a whole lot of nothing to punish the tech giants for violating the First Amendment.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) did recently file an antitrust lawsuit against Google, however, the subject of that suit is monopolistic, anticompetitive behavior as opposed to censorship.

When asked during the hearing if he plans to censor content on Facebook post-election that encourages violence, Mark Zuckerberg made the claim that “there are no exceptions” to its censorship rules, even if politicians break them.

“The three witnesses we have before this committee collectively pose, I believe, the single greatest threat to free speech in America and the greatest threat we have to free and fair elections,” Cruz went on to declare during the circus event.

Dorsey reluctantly responded to Cruz’s statements by suggesting that Twitter does “need to earn more trust” from the public, adding that “more accountability is needed” to create the illusion that Twitter supports free speech.

Those who call the coronavirus a “hoax” are making a huge mistake: These twelve questions reveal the TRUTH that no one dare utter,"(Natural News) There’s no question that elements of the coronavirus pandemic are being wildly exaggerated by mostly left-leaning mayors, governors and media pundits in order to punish America with economically destructive lockdowns (all in the hope of removing Trump from office, it turns out). We’ve even documented one of the most egregious deception efforts involving the Florida Dept. of Health, which has been rigging lab reports to claim 100% of those tested are “positive” for covid-19.

But it’s a mistake to leap to the conclusion that because left-wing operators hope to exaggerate the infections, hospitalizations and deaths that therefore the entire pandemic is a complete hoax and no one is dying from the coronavirus. That’s where the thinking is dangerously misguided and is already leading to complacency. Yet the idea that the entire coronavirus pandemic might be a hoax is a seductive one, especially on alternative platforms or conservative media, where it’s convenient to explain away all the economic damage as stemming from an elaborate hoax rather than to understand the complexities of a real pandemic augmented by fake news from the Left.

From Brighteon.com videos to InfoWars broadcasts, we repeatedly hear many people in independent media claiming the coronavirus is a “hoax.” There is no virus, they say, and all the infections, hospitalizations and deaths have all been faked, they claim. It’s all a grand, global theatrical production involving hundreds of thousands of nurses, doctors and coroners, all to trick the world into lockdowns that have no real justification, they tell us. This has become the dominant narrative in alt media.

But if that’s true, then how can there be a media cover-up regarding hydroxychloroquine, an off-patent, low-cost drug that successfully treats and cures coronavirus patients? If there’s no coronavirus, then what is hydroxychloroquine treating?

It’s easy to find reports of deaths being improperly attributed to covid-19, or even stories of false positives incorrectly flagging people with covid-19 when they really don’t have it. But the logic leap that many in the alternative media have taken is assuming that since some deaths were faked, therefore ALL deaths must have been faked.

Many of the same independent media sources that are reporting the coronavirus to be a “hoax” also reported on how Obama’s NIH, under Dr. Fauci, directed millions of dollars to the Wuhan virology lab to fund “gain-of-function” research. If the coronavirus is a hoax, and there is no coronavirus, then isn’t the Obama / Fauci / NIH story also completely bogus?

In fact, there are at least a dozen serious questions or contradictions that those who claim the coronavirus is a hoax can’t answer. Much of their reporting has been self-contradicting to the point where believing their news requires that you alternatively embrace the existence of the virus or denounce the virus as fake… depending on the day of the week.

But the coronavirus can’t be real on Monday, fake on Tuesday, real again on Wednesday and so on. Any explanation of coronavirus-related observations must, above all, deliver consistency. Unless, of course, you believe in transviralism, where viruses can magically pop into existence as easily as a biological man claiming he’s a woman so he can compete on the women’s college wrestling team.

For the record, we have consistently understood the coronavirus to be a very real threat, and we haven’t wavered from day one. While we acknowledge that much of the coronavirus testing is highly inaccurate — and hundreds of testing facilities seem to be deliberately finding all test to be “positive” in their results — even all that fraud doesn’t mean the coronavirus isn’t really impacting other people.

These questions and contradictions must be addressed by anyone who wants to be taken seriously

In watching the coverage of this issue by others, we’ve noticed twelve questions or contradictions that have repeatedly surfaced. See the full list below, and ask yourself this important question as you read through the list: Do logic and reason still apply in our universe?

Just as the radical Left claims biological sex doesn’t exist and a man can become a woman at any moment by making a wish, much of the conservative, independent media has an eerily similar view about the coronavirus, alternately claiming it’s either real or fake depending on what story they want to cover on that particular day.

Obviously, men can’t become women, and men can’t have babies. In the same way, the coronavirus can’t be both real and fake at the same time. So which is it?

Read the questions and decide for yourself:

Twelve questions for those who claim the coronavirus is a hoax

Question #1) Many in the alternative media reported on the New York City nurse who filmed undercover video and blew the whistle on how NYC hospitals were killing patients by rooming non-infected patients with coronavirus-infected patients, allowing transmission to occur. But how can non-infected patients be killed by the coronavirus if the coronavirus is a hoax?

Question #2) Alternative media outlets that are currently reporting the coronavirus to be a “hoax” are also reporting on how the mainstream media lied and covered up the story of how hydroxychloroquine can effectively and affordably treat coronavirus patients. If the coronavirus is a hoax, then what exactly is hydroxychloroquine treating, then?

Question #3) Many in the independent media are now pushing “mask hysteria” and claiming that wearing a mask causes death by asphyxiation or carbon dioxide poisoning. Yet Asian cultures — Taiwan, Japan, China, Korea, Singapore, etc. — have been wearing masks in public for decades, without a single recorded event of someone dying from wearing a mask. Surgeons wear masks during surgery without passing out, and masks are routinely worn by construction workers to filter particular matter such as sawdust, drywall dust and paint. If these masks have been safe and effective for more than fifty years, how did masks suddenly and magically become deadly and toxic in the last three months? Did the laws of physics change?

Question #4) Coronavirus pandemic skeptics claim all the infections and deaths are faked. But if all the deaths are faked, then why did those who are faking the deaths decide to keep dropping the daily death numbers from mid April through the end of June? If they’re faking all the deaths, then wouldn’t they want to keep faking more and more of them to make the pandemic look worse and worse? Why would they fake fewer deaths over time?

Question #5) Many independent media outlets that originally reported the coronavirus was a “genetically engineered biological weapon” designed to depopulate the planet are now reporting it’s all a hoax. But then they simultaneously report that Obama’s NIH, under Dr. Fauci, directed money to the Wuhan virology lab that built the weapon in the first place. If the coronavirus is a hoax, then there’s no story about Obama and Fauci funding a biological weapon “gain of function” program in China. How can both be true?

Question #6) In June, it was widely reported across the independent media that coronavirus infections caused the body’s cells to “sprout tentacles” that allowed the virus to attack adjacent cells and infect them. This was widely reported as more evidence that the virus was a genetically engineered biological weapon. As an example of the coverage, Zero Hedge reported:

“There are long strings that poke holes in other cells and the virus passes through the tube from cell to cell,” said UCSF’s Director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute, Professor Nevan Krogan. “Our hypothesis is that these speed up infection.”

So how can the coronavirus sprout “tentacles” if it doesn’t exist and is a total hoax?

Question #7: As Gary Heaven recently wrote in a Natural News article about coronavirus treatments that work, the common inhaler anti-inflammatory drug budesonide works extremely well to treat and cure covid-19 infections. A well-known doctor, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has been actively promoting the treatment as an alternative to expensive Big Pharma drugs and vaccines, proving that he’s not a pawn of the drug cartels:

If budesonide successfully treats patients who have covid-19, curing them and allowing them to leave the hospital and return to normal life, then what is budesonide treating if the coronavirus is a hoax? How can anyone simultaneously claim the coronavirus is a hoax and also claim the media is suppressing cures that work to treat it?

Question #8) Coronavirus skeptics explain that coronavirus deaths are faked in the United States because hospitals receive extra funding for every death that’s considered coronavirus-related. Thus, people who die from other causes are said to have died from coronavirus so that hospitals can receive extra funds from Medicare. But Medicare doesn’t pay hospitals in Italy, Brazil, Mexico or Russia, and the same financial incentives don’t exist in most countries. So how do you explain all the dead bodies in Guayaquil, Ecuador? Or the skyrocketing death rates in Brazil? Or the massive die-offs in Italy, where it would have been impossible to recruit thousands of doctors and nurses to participate in a grand false flag theatrical production?

Question #9) If the initial lockdowns didn’t work, then why did coronavirus daily deaths plummet soon after the lockdowns went into effect? And why are coronavirus deaths now beginning to surge back a few weeks after the lockdowns were relaxed? If the doctors, nurses, hospitals and coroners wanted to fake all the deaths, wouldn’t they want to keep faking more deaths, not fewer deaths?

Question #10) For months, we’ve been told by the independent media that “fear” is the problem, and that those talking about coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths were “pushing fear.” They said things like, “We need to flatten the fear curve,” and urged complete calm for everyone. Not long after, they turned around the told everybody you should be terrified of masks. So if “fear” is the enemy here, then why push fear about masks? Will all these same media pundits also tell us that children shouldn’t wear masks this Halloween and claim that children will drop dead all across America if they put on masks?

Question #11) If the coronavirus isn’t real, then why are many publishers who claim the pandemic is a “hoax” also telling people to take vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc and anti-viral supplements? Obviously, if the pandemic is fake, there’s no need to protect yourself from it. So why recommend immune-boosting supplements in the first place?

Question #12) If masks are so dangerous and kill people, then why are so many pro-liberty people perfectly fine with wearing Guy Fawkes masks? What about Halloween masks?

If we are to deal with the very real coronavirus pandemic — which was deliberately set into motion by China, using a genetically engineered virus that was clearly weaponized to kill human beings — we must have the critical thinking skills to filter out the fake news exaggerations without succumbing to an emotional knee-jerk reaction of declaring the entire thing doesn’t exist.

Daily deaths in the United States are now on the upswing, with Texas achieving an all-time record high in daily deaths just yesterday. Even if the infection testing is obviously bogus, how do you account for the sharp increase in deaths? And if your answer is that “all the deaths are being faked,” then you have to ask yourself why Texas wasn’t faking just as many deaths in April, May and June. Why suddenly in the middle of July? Texas isn’t a “pro-lockdown” state, either.

Then again, the result of the complacency wasn’t difficult to see coming. Back in April, I publicly predicted that June and July would be “complacency” months, followed by a second wave in August if people didn’t take this pandemic seriously.

Even though the Case Fatality Rate appears to be slowly dropping, rising complacency is exposing so many people to the infections that daily deaths are on track to continue rising for quite some time.

It now looks like August and September and on track to see a sharp surge in hospitalizations and deaths, even as mostly conservative publishers continue to claim the coronavirus isn’t even real.

Refrigerated trucks brought into Texas and Arizona to deal with all the dead bodies

“Texas and Arizona are bringing in refrigerated trucks to expand morgue capacity in several counties across each state, after the number of coronavirus fatalities shattered records this week,” reports Fox News. “Reuters reported that San Antonio and Bexar County each received five refrigerated trailers to store up to 180 bodies as some hospital morgues and funeral homes have reached capacity.”

Is this all staged, too? Does anyone seriously believe counties and cities in Texas are faking refrigerated trucks as some sort of elaborate theater to make a grand hoax more convincing?

And if the number of deaths occurring in these places were simply “normal,” then the morgues wouldn’t be overrun in the first place. So no, this isn’t just people dying from regular causes magically being switched and labeled as “covid-19 deaths.”

Clearly, more people are dying than usual. Via Fox News:

The Office of the Medical Examiner said it is currently at 63 percent morgue capacity but has brought in 14 cold storage containers– eight being held at the County facility and six more in reserve– that would allow an additional 294 decedents by the end of next week “if necessary,” Fields Moseley, a spokesperson for Maricopa County, told Fox News.

“We know some funeral homes are already at capacity in their morgues, so we want to be prepared in case we have to keep bodies for a longer period of time,” Moseley said.

Anyone calling the coronavirus a hoax is a fool, and this is about to become increasingly apparent over the next 3-4 months as the path of the coronavirus continues to follow almost exactly what I publicly predicted in April. It also means that you can expect a wave of lockdowns to continue to spread across America as hospitalizations and deaths accelerate.

We could have stopped this entire thing with zinc, vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine and wearing masks in public places. But instead, America has become so stupid and irrational that, instead, we are going to endure a devastating second wave of deaths and lockdowns that will probably devastate our economy and end in the total collapse of the United States of America.

Hybrid virus developed by scientists claims to make coronavirus research “safer”,"(Natural News) Studying the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) has been difficult due to how infectious the virus is and the need to keep researchers safe. To work around this, scientists have developed a virus that acts just like the coronavirus but doesn’t cause severe disease.

Currently, any laboratory research of SARS-CoV-2 – the pathogen behind COVID-19 – requires a high level of biosafety. Researchers work inside laboratories with multiple containment levels and specialized ventilation systems, all while wearing bulky full-body biohazard suits with pressurized respirators.

While necessary, these safety measures limit who can research the coronavirus to those labs that can afford the necessary equipment. This slows down efforts to find medicines and cures for the virus.

“Hybrid” virus created to make research safer

To allow researchers and institutions who don’t have access to the necessary biosafety equipment to contribute to the fight against the coronavirus, researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have created a new “hybrid” virus that infects cells and interacts with antibodies just like how the SARS-CoV-2 does. Unlike the latter, however, this new virus does not cause any severe illness.

The researchers used another virus, called a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as a base for the new hybrid virus. VSV is a workhorse in virology labs since it’s easy to manipulate genetically while, at the same time, being fairly innocuous. The virus primarily infects animals such as horses, cattle and pigs. When it does occasionally infect people, it only causes a mild, flu-like illness that lasts from three to five days.

Aside from being less deadly, one of the main differences between VSV and SARS-CoV-2 is how they infect cells. While viruses in general use proteins on their surface to attack cells, the latter uses what scientists have dubbed a “spike” protein.

To create the hybrid virus then, the scientists removed VSV’s surface protein gene and replaced it with the one from SARS-CoV-2. The resulting hybrid, dubbed VSV-SARS-CoV-2, has the coronavirus’ spike protein, allowing it to target cells in the same manner, but lacks the genes needed to cause severe illness.

Once they had the new virus, they tested it against antibodies from COVID-19 survivors. The test shows that the antibodies reacted to the hybrid virus in the same way that they did against the real SARS-CoV-2 virus. At the same time, antibodies that worked against the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 also worked against SARS-CoV-2. (Related: Most coronavirus patients develop “neutralizing antibodies” after recovery, but are they enough to head off another infection?)

“Humans certainly develop antibodies against other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but it’s the antibodies against spike that seem to be most important for protection,” said co-senior author Dr. Sean Whelan. “So as long as a virus has the spike protein, it looks to the human immune system like SARS-CoV-2, for all intents and purposes.”

New virus will supposedly accelerate the development of treatments

According to the team, this new hybrid virus could help more scientists evaluate a range of preventative treatments for COVID-19 that are based on neutralizing antibodies.

“One of the problems in evaluating neutralizing antibodies is that a lot of these tests require a BSL-3 facility, and most clinical labs and companies don’t have BSL-3 facilities,” explained Dr. Michael S. Diamond, co-senior author of the study.

“With this surrogate virus, you can take serum, plasma or antibodies and do high-throughput analyses at BSL-2 levels, which every lab has, without a risk of getting infected. And we know that it correlates almost perfectly with the data we get from bona fide infectious SARS-CoV-2,” he added.

According to Diamond, the hybrid virus could be used to test to see where or not an experimental vaccine triggers the creation of neutralizing antibodies, to measure whether a COVID-19 survivor carries enough of these antibodies to donate plasma to other COVID-19 patients or even identify if any antibodies have the potential to be developed into antiviral medicines.

In addition to being useful for expanding research on SARS-CoV-2, the fact that the hybrid virus has the same spike protein as the latter and triggers the same antibodies means that it could possibly also be used as a vaccine. According to Diamond, he and his colleagues are already conducting animal studies to evaluate the possibility.

Whether or not the hybrid VSV-SARS-CoV-2 virus can be effective as a vaccine is another matter altogether.

Vaccines work by using a virus, or something similar to it, to trigger the immune system to the production of antibodies against it. Studies have shown, however, that antibodies the body produces to fight SARS-CoV-2 tend to fade after just a few months. This means that the immunity provided by any COVID-19 vaccine – not just that based on the hybrid virus – will likely not last for long.

"UK study shows COVID-19 antibodies fade quickly, rendering vaccines pointless","(Natural News) COVID-19 has proven time and time again that it’s unlike any other illness society has faced, and a new study shows that preventing the disease is going to be incredibly challenging, as infections do not give people long-term immunity to the disease as many had hoped.

This is according to a study that was recently carried out by London’s Guy’s and St. Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust. The researchers studied the immune response in patients with the disease and found that the antibodies they developed decreased within a few weeks after the onset of symptoms. This means that people could well become reinfected after recovering from the illness.

According to the study, 23 days after the symptoms first appeared in patients, 60 percent experienced a potent antibody response; 65 days later, just 16.7 percent had this response. Antibodies are the proteins your body makes to fight off an infection. If there is any silver lining here, it’s the fact that those who had a more severe infection enjoyed an antibody response that was stronger and lasted longer.

The study looked at 59 patients who had tested positive for the disease, the majority of whom were men. Researchers collected sequential serum samples from the patients from one day to 94 days after their symptoms first appeared. They also looked at 31 healthcare workers who volunteered to undergo regular antibody tests.

The researchers noted that the antibody response to COVID-19 that they found was similar to that seen in other types of human coronaviruses, such seasonal coronaviruses linked to the common cold and SARS. In these viruses, a person’s antibody response tends to fade for a period of time that can be as little as 12 weeks or as long as 34 months after infection.

This study isn’t just bad news for those who have suffered from the disease and are hoping to avoid a repeat; it also indicates that coming up with a vaccine could be complicated, if not impossible. Even those with severe infections who enjoyed longer antibody responses still saw those effects fading within just a few months. That could mean, at the very least, that if a vaccine is developed, it will need to be administered frequently.

Dr. Mala Maini, a virus expert from University College London, told CNN that the study “suggests vaccines will need to be better at inducing high levels of longer-lasting antibodies than the natural infection or that doses may need to be repeated to maintain immunity.”

Other studies show similar antibody issues

The U.K. study is just the latest evidence that getting infected with COVID-19 doesn’t mean people can let their guard down. A study from Spain found that just five percent of the population there had coronavirus antibodies despite experiencing a significant outbreak this spring. Moreover, their immunity to the disease faded after just a few weeks. This means that 95 percent of the country’s population is still susceptible to the virus.

The study, which took place from April to June, encompassed more than 61,000 participants, making it the largest study of its kind to date in Europe.

The study also concluded that the antibodies in Spain’s population were not sufficient to provide herd immunity, which occurs when a population is allowed a certain amount of exposure to the virus to build up immunity among the general population.

Meanwhile, a study out of China that compared the antibody responses of 37 symptomatic patients with 37 asymptomatic people found that those who did not have symptoms experienced a weaker antibody response than those who did have symptoms.

Many people have already expressed concerns about the potential side effects of a rushed COVID-19 vaccine, but that may be a moot point if the vaccine is incapable of providing people with immunity to the disease in the first place.

Another study shows how quickly COVID-19 antibodies disappear,"(Natural News) When the coronavirus crisis first began, there was a lot of hope that at least those who survive the disease will develop immunity to it and won’t have to worry about catching it again. However, it has become painfully apparent that it doesn’t work that way at all. In fact, a trio of studies that have been released recently illustrate just how fleeting the immunity offered by coronavirus antibodies truly is.

The newest study comes out of London, where COVID-19 patients’ immune responses were analyzed. The researchers discovered that the levels of antibodies that could kill the virus dropped quickly after peaking a few weeks after the patients first exhibited symptoms. At the peak of their battle against the disease, 60 percent of the patients had a “potent” antibody response; two months later, however, only 16.7 percent of them had such a response.

For some patients, the antibody response against the virus went on to become undetectable. The study’s lead author, Katie Doores, said that although people are producing reasonable antibody responses to the virus, that response is fading quickly.

Meanwhile, a large study carried out in Spain showed that antibodies disappear just weeks after people test positive for the disease, deflating hopes for the possibility of attaining herd immunity. Herd immunity occurs when enough of the population becomes immune to a certain disease, either by already getting sick or through vaccines, to make it unlikely to spread throughout the community. The study, which was published in the journal Lancet, found that 14 percent of those who tested positive for antibodies did not have any antibodies just weeks later.

The study involved more than 60,000 participants, who answered questionnaires about symptoms and were given antibody and blood tests.

The report stated: “At present, herd immunity is difficult to achieve without accepting the collateral damage of many deaths in the susceptible population and overburdening of health systems.”

A different study, this one from China, found that antibodies faded quickly in people with COVID-19 symptoms and asymptomatic patients alike. The scientists found that more than 90 percent of people in both groups experienced deep declines in their antibody levels two to three months after the onset of their infection. Among the asymptomatic group, 40 percent tested negative for antibodies just eight weeks after being released from isolation.

Vaccines aren’t the answer

Of course, it goes without saying that if antibodies do disappear this quickly, any vaccine that is developed would have to be administered repeatedly throughout the year if people wanted to gain any amount of protection whatsoever. Most people don’t want to get even one vaccine, much less various shots throughout the year.

Making matters even more complicated is the fact that even if a coronavirus patient does develop antibodies, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they will have any immunity at all. Writing for CNN, Dr. William Haseltine said: “Only 15 percent of those who test positive for antibodies make the neutralizing antibodies necessary to develop immunity.”

Unfortunately, it looks like COVID-19 is much like many other types of coronavirus. The antibodies for other common coronaviruses generally disappear completely within somewhere between four months and a year, which is why people can catch the same one every year.

Vaccines may not offer much protection from the disease after all, and their long-term effects will be largely untested as they are rushed to the market. These studies underscore the importance of preventing the disease naturally. Wear a mask when you’ll be around others, and don’t forget that washing your hands frequently remains essential. One of the best lines of defense is keeping your immune system up. Eat a healthy and well-balanced diet, and make sure you get plenty of Vitamin C, zinc, and Vitamin D from the sun.

Doubts raised on effectiveness of coronavirus antibody testing in the UK,"(Natural News) Rapid antibody tests have been hailed as an effective way to check for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection for anyone who needs immediate results. Experts in the U.K., however, have warned that antibody tests are not reliable enough while questioning the use of wide-scale testing to influence public behavior.

According to a review of studies conducted by Cochrane, a U.K.-based network that assesses health research to help direct policy, roughly one in 10 antibody tests will miss cases of COVID-19. This could lead to people making harmful decisions delaying treatment or even traveling.

“There is no decision [patients] should be making based on the results of a test,” stated the review’s lead author Jon Deeks, a professor of biostatistics at Birmingham University in England. “We have to ask: Is this doing more harm than good?”

Review of studies raises doubts on antibody tests’ accuracy

Cochrane’s review took a look at 54 studies, the majority of which took place in China. In addition, it also looked at over 11,000 patient records and focused on 25 commercially available tests. Antibody test kits from Roche and Abbott Laboratories – those acquired by the British government – were not included in the review.

In reviewing the studies, the researchers outlined several concerns about their quality. This included the small size of some of the studies, as well as the inclusion of multiple samples from the same patients.

“Methodological limitations raise questions about how trustworthy these figures are,” said Deeks.

In one of the studies reviewed – a British one at that – the biomarker manufacturers did not approve the identification of the tests that had been evaluated. According to Deeks, this raised “moral issues.”

The review did find that that the tests, which rely on either a finger prick or blood being drawn from a vein, were much better at detecting the coronavirus in people at least two weeks after the onset of symptoms.

Tests conducted up to seven days after symptoms manifested picked up only 30 percent of coronavirus cases, the study found. From eight to 14 days after the onset, the tests found 70 percent; 15 to 35 days afterward, the tests detected more than 90 percent.

“The clearest result we have is that: Timing is critical,” said Deeks.

The researchers, however, said that they have no data on how well the tests work more than five weeks after symptoms manifest. In addition, they also state that the test’s accuracy may be much lower outside a healthcare setting – most of the studies evaluated the accuracy in hospitalized patients. As such, it is unclear whether they can detect antibody levels associated with milder and asymptomatic cases.

Based on their findings, the researchers said that the U.K. government’s antibody program should only be carried out for population-wide research purposes as scientists can adjust for accuracy limitations when looking at large datasets. The antibody tests should not, however, be used to inform individual decision-making.

Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University, who was not involved in the review, said that the review’s findings “make it very clear that most, if not all, commercially available tests are not sufficiently accurate to warrant their use outside of the healthcare setting.”

Immunity passports in doubt

The Cochrane review deals a serious blow to efforts to create “immunity passports” based on antibody testing, allowing people to go about their lives without fear of catching the COVID-19. (Related: The Bill Gates global nightmare is coming true with COVI-PASS Immunity Passports.)

Back in March, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed that the tests would be a “total game-changer” and that they would be “as simple as a pregnancy test” – neither of which has been the case.

While the test kits used by the British government – supplied by Roche and Abbott Laboratories – were not part of the review, issues have been raised about them as well.

In May, Deeks called into question the effectivity of these test kits. He pointed out how, in a review of Roche’s own evidence, their test kit failed to pick up 15 known coronavirus antibody-positive samples out of 93. The Abbott test, on the other hand, was more sensitive, picking up 90 out of 96 positive samples.

Despite all the concerns raised, however, U.K. officials remain adamant about antibody testing, with the Department of Health and Social Care stating that “antibody testing will improve our understanding of how coronavirus is spreading across the country, which will be vital for future decisions about controlling the virus.”

The coronavirus may actually be a vascular – and not a respiratory – disease,"(Natural News) The symptoms of COVID-19 may very well be eldritch horrors. In most cases, it can appear as cough, fever, chills and headache. But in severe cases, it can cause acute kidney failure and multiple organ damage – strange symptoms for what’s known as mainly a respiratory infection.

How COVID-19 causes the latter, in particular, was the focus of a recent paper by a team from University Hospital Zurich. In their report, senior author Frank Ruschitzka examined COVID-19 patients who exhibited severe symptoms. After the first body was autopsied, it showed tiny clots and dead cells within the capillaries of the lungs, as well as distended blood vessels in every organ in the body – a sign of severe inflammation.

This also showed why patients with severe COVID-19 are more likely to have strokes, blood clots and even heart attacks: The virus had targeted their blood vessels.

“[COVID-19] is a vascular problem,” added Ruschitzka, who published his team’s findings in the Lancet. “The lung is the main battlefield, but it’s a disease of the blood vessels.”

A blood vessel disease?

Months into the pandemic and with over 8 million cases and counting, medical experts are now looking into the possibility that COVID-19 is a vascular disease.

According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, patients who died from COVID-19 had nine times as many clots in their lungs as those who died of the H1N1 flu. Other studies have similar results, from inflammatory symptoms in children to strokes in adults with no history of the condition.

A study from Belgium looked at the findings of this study, as well as the Zurich study, and found that damage in the endothelial cells that line blood vessels in the lungs can predict if a COVID-19 patient will slip into the fatal “second phase” of the disease. In the report, senior author Peter Carmeliet explained that an infection can cause blood vessels to leak and clot in some patients. This, in turn, triggers inflammation in the body, as well as gives rise to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) – the complication responsible for most COVID-19 deaths.

“It’s a vicious cycle,” explained Nilam Mangalmurti, a lung expert at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

Blood vessels link chronic disease and COVID-19

The Belgian study, published in Nature Reviews Immunology, can shine a light on why COVID-19 is life-threatening for people with chronic illnesses like diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease, as the cells lining their blood vessels are already compromised.

Endothelial cells do more than line blood vessels and tissues. They also control the flow of substances and fluid into and out of a tissue, regulate blood pressure, prevent inflammation and inhibit clots. When these are injured, the cells signal immune cells and clotting factors to help repair the site of injury, as well as warn other cells of potential invaders.

Based on autopsy reports detailed in the Zurich study, researchers of the Belgian study believe that SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen behind COVID-19, can cause this response to go out of control. (Related: Coronavirus hijacks immune cells to create cytokine storms, says new study.)

Aside from exploring the possibility of COVID-19 being a vascular disease, researchers are also looking into the idea of using existing anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting treatments for the disease. In the U.S. and Europe, clinical trials that use drugs are already in progress. In China, the government has taken a more natural route, promoting the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine in treating COVID-19.

Scientists warn: Antibodies your body makes to fight the coronavirus don’t last long,"(Natural News) Antibodies that can supposedly grant immunity from COVID-19 have been the linchpin of many strategies to fight the ongoing pandemic. A new study, however, looks to put a damper on those plans.

Published on the journal Nature Medicine, this new study suggests that antibodies that the immune system produces against the coronavirus may last only two to three months.

Antibodies don’t last that long

Antibodies that can fight other coronaviruses, such as those that cause SARS and MERS, are thought to last for about a year. Based on this, scientists were hoping that antibodies against the Wuhan coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) would last at least as long.

Chinese researchers looked at 37 asymptomatic people and compared them to an equal number of people who had symptoms from the Wanzhou District in central China.

Several studies have shown that people who are most visibly ill with COVID-19 develop antibodies against the disease. This new study, however, is the first to look at the immune response of asymptomatic people.

The researchers found that the asymptomatic people did produce antibodies; however, their immune response was weaker than in those who developed symptoms.

More importantly, the antibody levels fell to undetectable levels in 40 percent of asymptomatic people, compared to just 13 percent of those who had symptoms.

Other experts question the study

While the study shows that antibody levels dropped quickly, especially in asymptomatic people, several experts cautioned that this doesn’t necessarily mean that people can get infected a second time.

These experts pointed out that the researchers did not into account the protection offered by immune cells that may fight the coronavirus on their own or produce new antibodies when they detect the virus.

Studies have already shown that the coronavirus triggers a cellular immune response, that is both robust and protective.

“Most people are generally not aware of T cell immunity, and so much of the conversation has focused on antibody levels,” said Columbia University virologist Angela Rasmussen.

Aside from virus-killing T cells, infected people also make so-called memory B cells, which can rapidly ramp up antibody production should they detect the coronavirus again.

Current immunity strategies may need rethinking

The results of the study cast doubt on the proposal for “immunity passports” that many experts, including those in the World Health Organization (WHO), have proposed.

With “immunity passports,” people who have been confirmed to have immunity against the coronavirus, either through antibody testing or because they’ve recovered from the disease, will be allowed to return to normal life.

The idea is that this would allow businesses to return to normal and economies to recover without having to risk a second wave of the disease — everyone who’s up and about should theoretically already be immune.

Another idea that the study shoots down is that of “herd immunity.” This concept relies on having a large enough portion of the general populace be immune to SARS-CoV-2, that it’s unable to spread to those who don’t have immunity.

Based on the study, however, these ideas won’t work since it implies that people don’t retain their immunity for very long.

Other studies do show that the immune systems of people who’ve recovered may be able to fight off the virus through other means; however, it would be reckless to just rely on these, especially as scientists still have much to learn about the disease.

Perhaps, a more responsible approach to the ongoing pandemic would be to focus on protecting people from catching the disease in the first place, providing people with protective equipment while testing and isolating those who’ve already caught it.

"People with mild symptoms can develop immunity against coronavirus, says research","(Natural News) French researchers have found that even mild cases of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) can produce antibodies in almost all patients. In addition, they reveal that the patient’s defenses against the virus increase as he starts recovery.

The report, which is posted on the medRxiv server, adds evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 could acquire some degree of immunity. But it’s still unclear how long recovered patients carry immunity or to what degree.

The issue of whether a person develops immunity against the coronavirus is something that continues to baffle scientists and policymakers alike. Currently, even scientists are divided on the idea that people with COVID-19 develop an immunity to it, and many public health policies are hinged on people developing immunity from the disease, or herd immunity.

Based on initial reports, patients who have mild COVID-19 symptoms either lack or have a limited presence of antibodies.

Most patients with mild symptoms develop antibodies

In the current study, researchers from the Pasteur Institute in Paris took samples from over 160 health workers from the CHU de Strasbourg Hospital in France. The health workers all tested positive for COVID-19 after a “super-spreader” event – a five-day prayer and fasting gathering at an evangelical church in eastern France. While the health workers who participated in the study had the coronavirus, they weren’t ill enough to be admitted to hospital.

The team noted that most COVID-19 studies on immunity looked at patients who were hospitalized following severe illness and then recovered. Their study, in contrast, focused on mild cases, which make up for around 80 percent of all infections.

The researchers used two assay tests to determine if the participants had developed antibodies – a commercially available test kit, and a test designed by the team to identify if antibodies were produced and if they have the ability to neutralize the virus. From the results of the second test, 99.4 percent of the participants produced antibodies – only one participant, a 58-year-old man, had no antibodies detected.

The team also noted that a person’s antibody response grew stronger as he recovered. The antibodies were also effective in fighting off the virus. (Related: Coronavirus hijacks immune cells to create cytokine storms, says new study.)

“The [neutralizing] activity is present much later than the appearance of antibodies and this is encouraging,” senior author Olivier Schwartz told Le Monde newspaper. He also added that his team is looking forward to studying the participants further to see how long the antibodies stay in their system.

The researchers also noted that the ability of antibodies to neutralize the virus becomes stronger over time. In particular, the neutralization activity of the antibodies was at 97 percent four weeks after the onset of symptoms. This could mean that most individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms develop antibodies within a month after exhibiting symptoms.

“Although not yet demonstrated, several lines of evidence suggest that the presence of [neutralizing] antibodies may be associated with protective immunity for Sars-CoV-2 infection,” the researchers concluded in their report. They added that patients who recovered from SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, had antibodies that persisted for at least two years after the infection.

Meanwhile, a separate study from the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported a case of a monoclonal antibody from a recovering COVID-19 patient. In the report, which was published in Nature, the team noted that the antibody exhibited a strong ability to kill the virus when it was used in treatment, as well as prevent the increase in viral load during preventive treatment.

"Pro-life group warns about COVID vaccines made from aborted babies, vaccine mandates","(Natural News) A pro-life group has called attention to some of the ethical issues surrounding vaccines and the coronavirus vaccine in particular, especially when it comes to the vaccines being made using the cells of aborted babies and the possibility of mandatory vaccination.

The Personhood Alliance issued 10 key points outlining the group’s official position on the ethics of vaccines. They are based on the principle of “the rights of born persons not to be forced to violate their own bodily integrity and/or moral conscience and the rights of pre-born persons not to be trafficked, commodified, and/or experimented upon without their consent.”

Many of the Big Pharma companies that make vaccines use cells from aborted babies to produce them. This is considered unethical by the alliance, who called on vaccine makers to do more to produce more ethical varieties, particularly in cases where taxpayer funding is being used.

They added that Christians should be demanding that pharmaceutical companies put a stop to the commodification and trafficking of humans at all stages of life and avoid practices that “perpetuate and encourage the relationship between abortion, biomedical science, and human trafficking, no matter when that connection was initiated or how long a practice has been socially accepted.”

Tyler, Texas Bishop Joseph Strickland has been vocal about this topic. In April, he tweeted that if the only way to get a vaccine for this virus is by using the body parts of aborted children, he will refuse it. He added: “I will not kill children to live.”

Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano and a group of other Cardinals issued a public letter in May reminding Catholics that it is morally unacceptable to use a vaccine that is derived from aborted fetuses. They added that people should be given the chance to refuse these vaccines without facing any penalties. It was signed by 22 priests as well as journalists, lawyers, doctors and academics. It has already collected more than 57,000 signatures.

Vaccine mandates “unethical and intrusive”

Their document also addresses the topic of mandatory vaccines, calling such policies “unethical and intrusive.” They said that people’s rights to refuse medical treatment on religious, health or moral grounds should be preserved and protected by law and that this should extend to decisions about vaccination. They added that forcing vaccines on people is a “violation of their biblical personhood.”

Bishop Athanasius Schneider of Astana, Kazakhstan, had harsh words for the practice, calling mandatory vaccines in an interview “the last step of Satanism.” Pope Francis, meanwhile, recently called for vaccinations to be “universal and for all.”

In May, President Trump confirmed that coronavirus vaccines will not be forced on people who do not want them at the federal level, acknowledging that not everyone will be willing to subject their bodies to these shots. However, individual governments could still require mandatory COVID vaccines at the state level.

Even without federal or state mandates, some employers could end up demanding that their workforce be vaccinated, even against their will. This could be much like what happens in the medical field now with doctors and nurses, who can lose their jobs for refusing to get a flu shot.

It isn’t a stretch to imagine certain types of workers being pushed out of their jobs for non-compliance, especially people working in hospitality or education, for example.

There are far too many ways that people could be coerced into getting the COVID shot, and the fact that many of the front-runner vaccines in development contain the cells of aborted babies adds an even more horrifying element to an already highly disturbing prospect.

Johnson & Johnson’s aborted baby Covid-19 vaccine harms trial participant,"(Natural News) Things are going exceptionally poorly for Big Pharma in its quest to release “warp speed” vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19). The latest casualty is Johnson & Johnson, which halted its trial due to an “unexplained illness” in one of its participants.

Similar to what happened with AztraZeneca’s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine trial, J&J observed a participant suffer from a serious adverse event, prompting the company to put an immediate stop to its Phase 3 operations.

This means that all trials involving J&J’s vaccine candidate, including a large-scale one launched on Sept. 22 by Janssen with an anticipated enrollment of 60,000 volunteers at 215 research sites, are now on hold while the pharma giant investigates what happened.

In cooperation with an “independent Data Safety Monitoring Board,” J&J is reportedly evaluating the participant, whose illness has not yet been publicly released. J&J’s “internal clinical and safety physicians” are also involved in the investigation.

According to the company, adverse events “are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies.” As a result, there are “prespecified guidelines” for how to proceed when a “serious adverse event” occurs.

More stories like this one can be found at Pandemic.news.

Injecting aborted babies into your body is never a good idea

Having received $1.5 billion from the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to produce a vaccine, J&J, along with AstraZeneca and several others that also received taxpayer funding, are rushing at “warp speed” to get a Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine to market as quickly as possible.

In J&J’s case, its vaccine contains a human fetal cell line known as PER.C6 that was taken from the retinal tissue of an 18-week-old baby boy who was aborted in The Netherlands back in 1985 and turned into a fetal cell line 10 years later.

AstraZeneca’s jab, which reportedly caused transverse myelitis in a participant, is similarly derived from an aborted baby cell line known as HEK 293. Like J&J, AstraZeneca halted its Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine trial when its aborted baby jab caused harm in a participant.

“I isolated retina from a fetus, from a healthy fetus as far as could be seen, of 18 weeks old,” stated Dr. Alex van der Eb, who developed the PER.C6 aborted baby cell line used in J&J’s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine.

“There was nothing special with a family history or the pregnancy was completely normal up to the 18 weeks, and it turned out to be a socially indicated abortus – abortus provocatus, and that was simply because the woman wanted to get rid of the fetus … what was written down was unknown father, and that was, in fact, the reason why the abortion was requested.”

It is no wonder that participants are suffering serious adverse events, as foreign DNA from aborted babies is not supposed to be injected into other human beings to “cure” them from alleged viruses, which is exactly what is now happening under Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” mass vaccination program.

Thanks to Trump’s large cash infusion into J&J, the company is expected to very soon deliver 100 million doses of its aborted baby vaccine, with the option already in place to deliver many more should the government request them.

“The volunteers for these vaccine trials are probably the insane screeching Karens that have an aneurysm whenever they spot someone without a mask at 100 yards,” wrote one LifeSiteNews commenter about the situation.

“There is a horrifying, fatal illness that attacks the brain – which only cannibals get,” noted another, the suggestion being that the aborted fetal cell component of these Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines is akin to cannibalism.

“This is the same thing on a lesser scale. No doubt God created certain inherent protections to natural law. Regardless what the scientists and know-it-alls may think or desire.”

"Universal vaccination passport has been in development since 2018, requires absolute compliance with endless list of vaccines","(Natural News) As the current pandemic rages on, people around the world are being ordered to do things for the “greater good.” Governments are requiring specific things from people in order to protect the “public health.”

Long before the current pandemic, the European Union had been in the planning stages of developing a “common vaccination card/passport.” This universal vaccination passport is also designed for the “greater good” and will be implemented as a requirement to protect the “public health.”

How might your liberty and livelihood be restricted if you do not succumb to all the vaccines required for the universal passport?

Populations around the world are currently being conditioned to socially distance themselves from one another, in the expectation that everyone they meet is a biological source of contamination — innately guilty of spreading disease. Showing no authorization of immunity, every person is to be considered a filthy vector of disease and is to be avoided at all costs. The vaccination passport will be presented as the solution to quell these disease fears. By showing electronic proof of vaccination, people will be able to “return to normal” – a term used by authorities to coerce people to believe that biologics (vaccines) are the passport to prove absolute immunization. The commercialization of social distancing will continue until all citizens can prove they have received the authorized injections.

The European Union has been working on global vaccine passport since 2018

The planning stages began in 2018 when the European Union released a survey comparing public confidence/skepticism toward vaccines. The survey, titled “2018 State of Vaccine Confidence” was presented to the European Commission. The report immediately criticized “vaccine hesitancy” and praised “vaccine confidence,” in an attempt to build public trust in the effectiveness and safety of vaccines. The report immediately blames “vaccine delays and refusals” as the sole reason why outbreaks occur, why people are dying. One of the ways these central vaccine planners can eliminate “vaccine delays and refusals” is to blame people for diseases they don’t have. The next step is to socially isolate anyone who refuses vaccines by restricting their liberties.

A “common vaccine passport” achieves these goals. This passport is blatant coercion, a violation of informed consent in medicine, an attack on personal choice, and ultimately sets the stage for segregation of healthy, unvaccinated people from society.

The central vaccine planners do not care how they ultimately coerce or manipulate people into submission. Soon after this coercive report was published, the EU commissioned a technical report titled “Designing and implementing an immunization information system” which mapped a monitoring system to ensure compliance to vaccinations. The report examined the development of a “common vaccination card/ passport for all including a comprehensive electronic immunization information system that can monitor vaccine compliance. Finally, the report sought to “overcome the legal and technical barriers impeding the interoperability of national immunization information systems.”

By the third quarter of 2019, the EU created the “Vaccination Roadmap” designed to combat “vaccine hesitancy.” During this time, social media platforms began to label any information about vaccine choice, natural immunity, vaccine risk, and vaccine injury as dangerous “misinformation.”

Global Vaccination Summit and the “call to action” to implement the vaccine passport

By September 2019, the EU and the World Health Organization held the “Global Vaccination Summit.” There, “influential” leaders announced “10 Actions towards Vaccination for All” – a coercive plan to manipulate people into vaccine compliance. To make matters worse, just a month later, Event 201 was held. Sponsored by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Event 201 simulated a pandemic exercise focusing on a zoonotic novel coronavirus originating in bats. By November of 2019, these central vaccine planners had suggested a “call to action.”

All this planning came before the current pandemic. The people who have planned for a vaccine passport are now calling for a “certificate of immunity.” Central vaccine planners like Bill Gates are now parading the media, and are putting their “call to action” into motion. People are now being told by their governments and their media that life cannot go back to normal unless there is a vaccine. The vaccine, currently being rushed into existence, will enable the coercive and forceful vaccination passport to become a reality.

The planning is documented. The coercion is out in the open. Will you be a slave to this system of medical rape, as individual consent, choice, and human dignity are stripped away?

"Eugenicist Bill Gates co-hosted a “high-level pandemic exercise” back in October, just in time for the patented coronavirus he helped fund to be unleashed","(Natural News) Not long before Chinese coronavirus started making global headlines, The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, held a high-level pandemic exercise called “Event 201” that seems to have been a predictive blueprint for what’s now transpiring with the coronavirus outbreak.

On October 18, 2019, representatives from each of the aforementioned groups descended on New York City to discuss how they would respond to “a severe pandemic” much like the one we’re now being told is spreading across China and into the West.

The exercise “illustrated areas where public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences,” an official announcement from Event 201 reads.

“In recent years, the world has seen a growing number of epidemic events, amounting to approximately 200 events annually,” the announcement goes on to explain. “These events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society.”

According to the event’s organizers, a pandemic like the one we could be seeing form right now before our very eyes requires “cooperation” among governments, industries, and “key international institutions” – the latter presumably referring to organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Is coronavirus yet another ploy to thin the “herd” and sell more vaccines?

The timing of Event 201 is nothing short of suspicious in light of the fact that coronavirus is all the media is talking about right now. It’s even eclipsing President Trump’s impeachment proceedings in the Senate, with news about entire cities in China that are home to tens of millions of people being put under mandatory quarantine.

We’re also seeing headlines about coronavirus popping up in major U.S. cities like Seattle, Houston and Chicago, which is starting to generate panic here in our own country about how far this thing will go before either fizzling out – a best-case scenario – or spreading like wildfire.

As Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, is now warning, the rapid adaptation or mutation of coronavirus suggests that this might be another weaponized viral strain that was intentionally unleashed for eugenics purposes.

Mainstream reporting is admitting that coronavirus is constantly changing like some kind of self-replicating bioweapon, which is all too convenient considering that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Pirbright Institute owns a patent on coronavirus for vaccine creation purposes.

Was this whole outbreak engineered for the purpose of scaring the general public into accepting yet another government vaccine? Is it also about depopulating the planet as part of Bill Gates’ admitted efforts to use vaccination and “health care” as a means of reducing the world’s population by 10 to 15 percent?

Time will tell what becomes of this latest public health scare, but one thing is for sure: Bill Gates and his eugenicist buddies are chomping at the bit to vaccinate the entire planet against coronavirus and any other disease they can conjure up as a deadly bioweapon.

At the current time, the fatality rate associated with coronavirus infection is relatively low, around two percent. But that could very quickly change as the virus mutates and adapts to new environments, creating the horrific scenario predicted by Event 201.

“Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global – a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences,” the Event 201 description ominously forebodes.

“A severe pandemic, which becomes ‘Event 201,’ would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions.”

Doctor who cured 350 coronavirus patients with 100% success rate speaks out passionately in Washington D.C.,"(Natural News) Dr. Stella Immanuel of the Rehoboth Medical Center in Houston, Texas went viral in a matter of hours after appearing live at the “White Coat Summit” in Washington, D.C. in front of the Supreme Court of the United States. Dr. Immanuel gave a hopeful, passionate speech about curing coronavirus patients with 100 percent effectiveness.

The event was led by an organization called America’s Frontline Doctors, a group founded by Dr. Simone Gold, a board-certified physician and attorney. The group of medical doctors came together and presented a message of hope and addressed a “massive disinformation campaign” about the coronavirus — disinformation that is suppressing immune system modulating cures, treatment, and prevention.

Courageous doctor goes public with covid-19 cure

Dr. Immanuel cured three hundred fifty coronavirus patients with a 100 percent success rate using a combination of hydroxychloroquine (sixty-year-old anti-viral compound with a track record of safety and effectiveness) zinc (an immune system modulating mineral) and azithromycin (broad-spectrum antibiotic).

The original video has already been removed by almost every Big Tech social media platform (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), as the Big Pharma gatekeepers of information try to keep the people in the dark, controlled, afraid, and subservient to an official, helpless narrative. Access the video here at Brighteon.com.

Dr. Immanuel wrote that the fear, sickness, and deaths were “senseless and unnecessary.”

“Covid19 has a cure,” she spoke. “It’s time for politicians to let doctors be doctors and for doctors to stop being afraid. They can silence a few but not a multitude. Join us in the fight doctors! America needs you!”

Dr. Immanuel said that any study that claims hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is not effective for treating patients with coronavirus is “fake science.” She knows this for a fact because she used the antiviral medication to help all her patients recover from coronavirus infections.

In fact, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who downplayed the drug’s effectiveness, actually knew about its effectiveness for treating coronavirus for fifteen years, when the NIH published studies on chloroquine’s effectiveness for treating SARS.

Dr. Anthony Fauci trying to suppress effective treatments to force experimental vaccines on people

In what appears to be a matter of corruption, Dr. Fauci is currently trying to convince the world population to stay confined in their homes and to comply to contact tracing, restricted gathering, and indefinite mask wearing until a DNA-altering vaccine is available for population control. Fauci’s guidance has left countless men and women to die from a respiratory infection that could be cured using a simple antiviral, immune system modulating protocol.

The research that Fauci knew about while working at the NIH finds that “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” HCQ is a less toxic derivative of this chloroquine and can help deliver zinc into human cells, halting viral replication and speeding up recovery time for patients. Since the new covid-19 virus is genetically related to SARS, the NIH and Dr. Fauci should have rushed to try the drug and promote its use. Instead, Dr. Fauci began raising money for new vaccines and suppressed the effectiveness of this cheap antiviral molecule.

Instead of reigning from a fearful pulpit and doing photo-ops, Dr. Fauci should be meeting with front line doctors and nurses who care for coronavirus patients first hand. HCQ is an effective prophylactic and therapeutic, stopping the replication of viruses in human cells before and after infection with a live virus.

Dr. Immanuel is a light in a dark world and a true leader in medicine at a time when people are being conditioned to fear their own hands and breath while submitting to arbitrary controls.

"Trump pushes for an accelerated, risky vaccine “by the end of the year,” then says coronavirus will “go away without a vaccine”","(Natural News) A few days ago, President Trump publicly announced that a new vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) would probably be ready “by the end of the year” as part of “Operation Warp Speed.” But the president has since changed his tune and is now saying that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will “go away without vaccine.”

Even though it typically takes anywhere from three to five years to develop a new vaccine, the Trump administration had appeared fully supportive of developing one in a fraction of that amount of time to address the current global pandemic. Trump himself even indicated that he is “pushing very hard” to make a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine come to fruition as quickly as possible, even though this accelerated timeline puts many people’s lives at risk.

“We are pushing supply lines,” Trump is quoted as saying to the media. “We don’t even have the final vaccine,” he further stated, adding that he believes “many companies are, I think, close,” citing pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson by name.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has largely agreed with Trump’s statements, indicating that it is possible “to shave a couple of months off that,” referring to a proposed 18-month accelerated timeline for the release of a new vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“But, you know, you don’t want to over-promise,” Fauci added during an interview with CBS News. “We’ll just have to see how it goes.”

Not long after this all occurred, however, President Trump switched gears and began to tell the media the exact opposite of what he had stated prior. Without going into specifics, Trump pointed to other viruses and flus that have “disappeared” before vaccines were ever developed for them, and suggested that the same will happen with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“It’s going to go away,” Trump stated emphatically. “And we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time … They’ve never shown up again,” he added, referring to other viruses and flus in the past. “They die, too. Like everything else, they die.”

What is Trump’s real position on vaccines and coronavirus?

Doublespeak on the part of Trump is nothing new, and he has received plenty of criticism over the years for his duplicitous statements, sometimes made just hours apart from one another. On the other hand, some believe that Trump is playing some kind of long game where he intentionally says contradictory things to weed out who’s who in his administration.

Long before he was president, Trump publicly stated that he “strongly” believes vaccines to be linked to autism, which suggests that he does not support the government’s vaccine agenda. With that said, Trump’s now-stated plan for an accelerated Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine by year’s end could simply be a decoy to bait his enemies into exposing their true intentions.

On the other hand, it could be that Trump simply does not know how to tell the truth and is in a constant state of flux when it comes to his position on any given matter. Is Trump really against vaccines, or was he rallying public support for himself among vaccine skeptics years before he decided to run for president?

As of this writing, Trump’s most recent stated position is that a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will not be needed because the virus is going to disappear for good some other way. And this is the position we hope he sticks with moving forward.

"Medical trials for COVID-19 vaccine candidates may be unable to stop people from falling ill and dying, scientist warns","(Natural News) A scientist has warned that phase three trials currently underway for COVID-19 vaccine candidates may ultimately be unable to stop the coronavirus. University of Maryland professor Peter Doshi wrote in an Oct. 21 piece in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) that coronavirus vaccines currently being developed may not be able to protect people from serious illness or death once they contract the pathogen.

His statements followed trials conducted by seven pharmaceutical companies – Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm and Sinovac – for their respective coronavirus vaccine candidates. Doshi, who is also the BMJ’s associate editor, pointed out two issues in the ongoing vaccine trials.

First, scientists did not anticipate whether volunteers would be shielded from severe disease or death if they contract the pathogen before the vaccine is rolled out – which would only be the case if the vaccine did not work very well. This is a particular concern for senior citizens, who are the most at risk from the effects of a severe COVID-19 infection, as the vaccine may not be as effective at protecting them from the coronavirus in the first place.

Vaccines typically do not work as well for people aged 60 and up because of their aged immune system. Pregnant women, children, and immunocompromised people have also been excluded from vaccine trials, so there is little data on the vaccine’s effects on these populations.

Second, the studies will not prove person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 can be halted – as scientists themselves are not measuring if volunteers who contract the coronavirus pass it to their friends and family whether or not they themselves get sick.

“The current phase three trials are not actually set up to prove either,” Doshi commented.

Pharmaceutical companies have defended the value of these vaccine trials

Many countries in the world are hoping to discover a vaccine that works to put an end to the current coronavirus pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 1 million worldwide. Thus, a number of scientists have responded to Doshi’s take on vaccine trials.

Moderna Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tal Zaks told BMJ that if its vaccine is proven to protect against mild COVID-19, the company is confident that the vaccine will be of the same effect with more severe infections. The vaccine will have to be ineffective in the first place if a person develops the disease. Zaks added that “too many people would die” if studies looked at the ability of Moderna’s vaccine to prevent coronavirus deaths. (Related: Fascism on display: The NIH owns HALF of Moderna’s new coronavirus vaccine.)

Dr. Andrew Preston of the University of Bath agreed with Zaks, telling the Daily Mail that “covering every manifestation of COVID-19 would require trials so large … that they are very likely to be impossible to run and fund. Preston added that vaccine trials encompassing all COVID-19 symptoms “would delay the data so long that we’d be living without any vaccine … for years to come.”

Preston remarked that testing vaccines on vulnerable populations such as the elderly would have “highly questionable ethics,” so it made more sense to test whether the vaccine worked in people who would experience less severe complications. However, he agreed that vaccine trials should be clear regarding what they will and will not report.

“I suspect many … [want] to ‘return life to normal’ and so there needs to be careful consideration of what the various effects of the vaccines might be. So it’s important that as we head towards the point when mass vaccination will begin, everyone is clear about what this will change in terms of restrictions, public health and disease,” he said.

Coronavirus vaccine trials barely tackle the issue of safety

Phase three trials for coronavirus vaccine candidates look at the efficacy of the jabs, but not their safety. Two pharmaceutical firms already reported volunteers experiencing adverse reactions after being administered with coronavirus vaccines.

Johnson & Johnson suspended U.S. trials for its one-shot coronavirus jab after a volunteer experienced an “unexplained illness.” It identified “no clear cause” for the illness and attributed the volunteer’s adverse reaction to “many possible factors.” The drug maker’s suspension of its vaccine trials was “in compliance with regulatory standards,” it stated.

AstraZeneca already reported three instances of adverse reactions in coronavirus vaccine trial participants. Two volunteers reported spinal inflammation after receiving the jab in September, while a third participant died in October. However, the British pharmaceutical company will not put vaccine trials on hold.

Doshi pointed out two issues in the vaccine trials, but the real question should be: Are these new COVID-19 vaccines even safe?

Who needs SCIENCE? China justifies widespread COVID-19 immunizations without bothering with clinical trials,"(Natural News) The Chinese government defended widespread immunizations against COVID-19 outside of clinical trials in the country. The vaccinations were warranted, as there were no documented side effects from the experimental vaccines, and imported COVID-19 cases proved to be a serious risk to the country. Chinese National Health Commission director for coronavirus vaccine development Zheng Zhongwei said Oct. 20 that China still sees “enormous pressure” from imported cases despite efforts to address outbreaks domestically.

Chinese health authorities authorized in July the emergency use of three potential vaccine candidates made by domestic pharmaceutical companies China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), under its subsidiary China National Biotech Group, and Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Frontline workers such as medical staff treating coronavirus patients and border officials received the experimental jab, but the order has since been expanded to include those working in state-owned companies. The government is also considering a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for exchange students going overseas to study.

Meanwhile, Sinovac has permitted members of the public in at least two Chinese cities to register and receive its its CoronaVac experimental shot. Zheng said that people who join Sinovac’s emergency-use program will be tracked for any adverse reactions. He added that immunized individuals reported no serious reactions beyond low-grade fevers and rashes.

However, experts have criticized the large-scale vaccinations with the experimental jabs – with some calling it “dangerous” and “a misuse of the program.”

New coronavirus infections in China have lingered to below 100 a day since mid-August, but the virus still resurges in small areas – with the most recent one in the eastern city of Qingdao. Chinese health officials have managed to suppress these outbreaks – including one in Beijing – through mass testing and implementation of public health protocols. Mask-wearing rules and temperature checks are still in place, and travelers from other countries need to isolate themselves for 14 days.

Based on data collated by Johns Hopkins University, China has a COVID-19 caseload of 91,044, with 4,729 fatalities and 85,899 recoveries.

Just like the U.S., China fast-tracked the development of its coronavirus vaccine

Countries looking to move beyond the pandemic and open their economies definitely need a vaccine against the coronavirus – and fast.

The vaccine development process, which usually takes years, has been compressed into months thanks to politicians looking for a cure to the pandemic that has made 40 million people worldwide sick. Under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Operation Warp Speed is one such program to fast-track the development of a COVID-19 vaccine – albeit only limited to Americans. (Related: Trump administration demanding nationwide rollout of COVID-19 vaccines by Nov. 1.)

In a similar vein, Chinese drugmakers are leading the race to create an effective shot against the coronavirus. China’s emergency-use authorization parameters were approved following rigorous deliberation among vaccine and ethics experts. The World Health Organization backed these same parameters, which served as the basis for giving Sinovac and Sinopharm’s vaccine candidates the emergency green light.

However, safety concerns have emerged alongside the rush to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine. Western pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca have temporarily halted their vaccine trials after volunteers experienced adverse side effects. To make matters worse, The Epoch Times reported on Oct. 15, the death of a Brazilian participant in AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine trials.

Sinopharm and Sinovac representatives nevertheless assured there had been no reports of adverse reactions in phase three trial participants. Both companies have enrolled more than 50,000 people worldwide in their vaccine trials. With this outlook, Sinopharm Chairman Liu Jingzhen said his company would produce 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses next year.

The two companies will have to increase their production capacity to churn out more of their vaccine doses, as some countries had already placed orders. In late September, Sinovac inked a deal with the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo for 60 million coronavirus vaccine doses costing US$90 million. Reuters reported Oct. 3 that Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria asked Brazilian health regulator Anvisa to vaccinate the state’s population with CoronaVac.

The world must be aware of potential safety concerns alongside China’s efforts to fast-track a vaccine against the coronavirus.

"Same doctors pushing masks, lockdowns to “save lives” ignore forced organ harvesting in communist China","(Natural News) There is a pandemic of illicit organ harvesting taking place on a global scale, and the medical profession, too preoccupied with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) plandemic, is either turning a blind eye to it or complicit.

Those in need of vital organs who are unable to procure them through legal means are increasingly traveling to communist China, where prisoners of conscience such as members of Falun Gong are being systematically murdered by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) so their organs can be harvested and sold on the black market.

This is precisely what a woman who was in need of a liver took advantage of after Dr. Alexander Toledo diagnosed her with cancer. Failing to meet transplant criteria and unwilling to accept a non-curative treatment that at best would add nine months to her life, the woman traveled to China before returning to the United States with a fresh liver.

“She had received a liver transplant essentially on demand, which, of course … raised questions as to the source of the organs,” Toledo recalled about the 2008 case during an Oct. 26 online panel hosted by the University of North Carolina.

While under normal circumstances a transplant patient would receive a vital organ from a deceased donor, or perhaps a living donor with an extra to spare, transplant “tourism” is changing the way that people in need of surgery are living their best lives now.

In the case of the woman seen by Toledo, she returned to America with a new liver and “no meaningful donor information … beyond that the donor was young and healthy.” After doing a little digging, Toledo found out that the liver had been harvested from a prison of conscience in communist China and sold on the illicit transplant market.

China’s organ harvesting trader has been verified “beyond any reasonable doubt”

Since China did not have an official organ donation program at the time, it became clear very quickly that the transplant had come from an executed prisoner. Further investigation pinpointed the victim as a likely adherent to the spiritual practice of Falun Gong, which is prohibited in China.

Back in 1999, the CCP launched a massive persecution campaign against Falun Gong, for which there were about 100 million adherents during the 1990s. In the decades since, China has imprisoned and executed millions of them, as well as harvested their organs.

Despite a complete media blackout here in the states – this is due to nearly every major media corporation being in bed with the CCP – independent investigations have determined that the CCP is, in fact, harvesting the organs of primarily Falun Gong practitioners and selling them on the black market.

And this is happening “on a significant scale,” an independent tribunal discovered back in 2019. For at least the past decade, China’s illicit organ harvesting market has been going strong with little resistance, and almost nobody in the medical profession seems to care.

According to David Matas, a Canadian international human rights lawyer who has been studying the issue for at least the past 10 years, most in the medical community are turning a blind eye to China’s horrific human rights abuses, even as they continue to lecture us all about how we need to sacrifice our freedoms and liberties in order to “save lives” from being overtaken by COVID-19.

Only “a tiny minority of the transplantation professionals globally are willing to do anything about transplant abuse in China,” he warns. And many of them, he adds, are buying into the “Chinese propaganda hook, line, and sinker.”

“They echoed the Party line that the research is unverifiable, though it is both verifiable and verified beyond any reasonable doubt,” he contends.

Remdesivir study accidentally proves hydroxychloroquine effective against coronavirus,"(Natural News) To date, there has only been one study conducted on remdesivir, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) drug that Anthony Fauci wants you to take instead of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). And it just so happens that this one-and-only study does not actually prove the effectiveness of remdesivir.

As it turns out, the study proves quite the opposite: that remdesivir is essentially useless, and HCQ is a winner, when it comes to remediating the symptoms associated with a severe COVID-19 infection.

Despite the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) having granted emergency approval for remdesivir as an exclusive drug treatment for COVID-19 five months ago, the latest science does not support its use as an effective therapeutic.

The aforementioned single paper on remdesivir that the FDA used as “proof” of the drug’s safety and effectiveness actually found that HCQ, presumably in conjunction with the antibiotic drug azithromycin, provided the only tangible benefits observed throughout the research.

This final paper, which was published just a few weeks ago on Oct. 8, determined that at least 35 percent of study participants had received HCQ. And nearly all of the patients who benefitted were those who took HCQ, as opposed to remdesivir.

“Nothing in the study supports the hypothesis that [r]emdesivir is an effective antiviral for SARS-CoV-2,” notes Leo Goldstein. “The data in the final report suggests that [h]ydroxychloroquine, not [r]emdesivir, was the main factor benefitting the patients in this study.”

Remdesivir harms and kills coronavirus patients; it does not heal

What is worse, the study further found that the patients who received remdesivir as opposed to HCQ actually suffered worse outcomes. You read that correctly: the drug claimed by Fauci to be a “cure” for COVID-19 is actually killing COVID-19 patients.

“The study’s own numbers show an association between RDV (remdesivir) and increased mortality in the most severe patients,” Goldstein further explains. “It is also possible to conclude that RDV is net harmful for most hospitalized patients.”

Another thing to note about this study is that it in no way meets any of the FDA’s usual “gold standards” for reliable research. For one, it was not double-blinded, though it was falsely reported as such.

The pre-registered protocol was also changed multiple times over the course of the trial, as was the primary outcome of the research. The outcome, it turns out, was altered after it was determined that remdesivir was not providing the types of results that researchers had hoped to procure.

“The outcome measures were subjective and not reliable,” Goldstein further reveals, adding that the study “was marred with conflicts of interest, aggravated by the design giving NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) and Gilead (remdesivir’s manufacturer) leverage over the hospitals and physicians treating patients.”

None of this is all that surprising when considering the dark history of Gilead, which by all appearances is a terrorist organization that conspires with the deep state to commit heinous crimes against humanity.

This would explain why at least three of the study’s researchers received grants and/or personal fees directly from Gilead, and conveniently failed to report these as potential conflicts of interest.

Chances are that none of this will ever hit mainstream media headlines, which means readers like yourself will have to share it with your friends and family directly. We must spread the truth far and wide because the sooner we do, the sooner this whole plandemic house of cards comes crashing down where it belongs.

By the way, if you are interested in taking a closer look at the study and Goldstein’s analysis of it, you can do so at this link.

Gates vaccine spreads polio across Africa,"(Natural News) Microsoft founder Bill Gates has made himself the global vaccine czar as his foundation spends billions on spreading new vaccines globally. While much attention has been given to the role of Gates behind the corrupt WHO in promoting radical untested coronavirus vaccines, the record of the Gates Foundation pushing an oral polio vaccine across Africa gives more sobering evidence that all Gates says and does is not genuine human charity. The UN has just recently admitted that new cases of infantile paralysis or polio have resulted in Africa from an oral polio vaccine developed with strong support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It mirrors what happened in the USA in the 1950s. This is worth a closer look.

(Article by F. William Engdahl republished from Journal-Neo.org)

Vaccines that cause polio

The vaccine industry loves to cite development of vaccines in the 1950s as solely responsible for eradicating what was a severe paralytic illness that reached a peak in the USA after World War II and as well, in England, Germany and other European countries. Now, despite the fact that no new cases of “wild polio” virus have been detected in all Africa since 2016, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and their allies in the WHO proclaimed that Gates’ $4 billion ten-year African vaccination campaign using an oral polio vaccine had finally eliminated the dreaded polio. That was at the end of August.

One week later on September 2, WHO was forced to backtrack and admit that new polio outbreaks in Sudan were linked to an ongoing series of new polio cases in Chad and Cameroon. According to the WHO, further polio cases have been registered in more than a dozen African countries including Angola, Congo, Nigeria and Zambia. But the shocking thing is that the outbreaks are all reportedly caused by the Gates-backed oral polio vaccine.

In a revealing comment, a CDC virologist involved with WHO and Gates Foundation in the Africa mass polio vaccination campaign, part of something called the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, admits the vaccine is creating significantly more cases of polio paralysis than the deceptively named “wild polio” disease. “We have now created more new emergences of the virus than we have stopped,” virologist Mark Pallansch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention admitted. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is a combined effort of the WHO, UNICEF, the U.S. CDC, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Rotary International.

Bill Gates was reportedly responsible for driving the campaign to develop the liquid oral polio vaccine and massively administer it to the populations of Africa and Asia despite the near absence of any cases of “wild polio.” According to one of the partners in the Gates polio initiative, from Rotary International, “Gates personally drove the development of a new polio vaccine that is now in the final stages of testing. When the idea was put forward, about the time of the last case of polio to happen in India, many were thinking the vaccine would play no important role in eradication, but Gates insisted.” When someone asked him, why polio, which had all but vanished worldwide, Gates replied, “Polio is a terrible disease.”

That reply seems curious, as there are far more pervasive deadly diseases out there including malaria or chronic diarrhoea due to unsafe water, and poor sanitation across Africa that causes death by dehydration, poor absorption of nutrients or infectious complications. I would argue that both those are also “terrible.” In 2016 chronic diarrhoea was listed by the WHO as the second leading cause of death in children below five worldwide. In Africa it was cause of almost 653,000 deaths, yet Mr. Gates and friends seem to be interested in other things.

The insistence of Gates on pushing massive vaccination of a new oral polio vaccine his foundation backed at a time polio even in poor countries of Asia and Africa is virtually non-existent, should ring alarm bells loudly. If his goal is to help more African children lead healthy lives, simple water treatment projects would save far more lives. Or is there something in the polio vaccine we are not being told of? Is there aluminum as adjuvant that is documented to be a central nervous system paralytic? Or other toxins?

The Gates Foundation spent almost $ 4 billion to develop and administer the oral polio vaccine throughout the poorest countries in the world as of 2018. This despite that WHO stated that the cases of polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan went from about 350,000 per year to 33 in 2018. There hasn’t been a case in the Americas or Western Europe since before the Gates polio project was launched years ago.

Define it away?

Here it gets into some very suspicious linguistic games on the part of WHO, Gates and company. They are trying to cover their deeds by claiming that most of the polio cases are actually something they decided to call acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). That is a debilitating condition with a clinical picture virtually identical to polio. But it keeps the “polio” numbers down. According to the US CDC, there were over 31,500 documented cases of acute flaccid paralysis from just 18 countries in 2017. This is in addition to what they call vaccine-associated polio paralysis (VAPP). Yet from the point of clinical symptoms, vaccine-derived polio, wild polio and acute flaccid paralysis are identical, as is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a subtype of AFP. With this proliferation of serious medical-sounding names to describe what produces the same medical symptoms, we have huge ground for manipulation.

A paper written by Neetu Vashishi and Jacob Puliyel published in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics in 2012 wrote about the Gates-CDC-WHO mass oral polio vaccine effort there: “… while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated…”

The 1950s

Defining away cases of poliomyelitis or Infantile Paralysis as it was called during the epidemic in the USA after World War II, went back to the 1950s, and to since-suppressed deadly scandals involving the first purported polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk. Regarded today as a medical hero, the truth of Salk was anything but heroic.

The upsurge in cases of what were then labelled poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis in the United States began to literally explode around 1946. Relevant to note is that a highly dangerous cumulative toxin, a now-banned insecticide known as DDT, was being promoted by the US government as a “safe” control of mosquitoes and flies said to be the “carriers” of polio virus. What has since been all but erased from the government record is the precise match of the number of cases of children with symptoms of acute polio with the degree of acute DDT spraying, and the equally precise mirrored decline of human polio cases from the late 1940s into the 1950s, after a sharp decline in DDT use. In 1953, Connecticut physician, Morton S. Biskind argued in public that, “the most obvious explanation for the polio epidemic: central nervous system diseases… such as polio are actually the physiological and symptomatic manifestations of the ongoing government- and industry-sponsored inundation of the world’s populace with central nervous system poisons.”

The Salk polio vaccine was first deployed in 1955, that is two years after the dramatic decline in registered polio cases. That fact was conveniently forgotten as the narrative was promoted that the new vaccine alone was eradicating the feared polio.

Serious evidence was presented by doctors and others to the US Congress that there was a clear connection between the summer polio epidemics to summer-used heavy metal pesticides such as DDT. They were ignored. The promotion of DDT as a harmless insecticide was so pervasive that kids followed behind trucks spraying the streets and swimming pools were sprayed with DDT, believing it harmless. Highly emotional advertising campaigns proclaimed that deadly polio was mysteriously transmitted by insects and that DDT would protect. Farmers were told to repeatedly spray their dairy cows with DDT to ward of the dangerous insects. DDT thus contaminated the milk supply. Use of DDT exploded by the end of the 1940s across the USA. As one person described it, “Concerned parents went further to protect their children. They feared the invisible virus as if it were hunting their children. They turned their homes into sterile zones by constantly spraying insecticides and washing down the walls with disinfectants.” That sounds familiar.

Salk and Rockefeller

The vaccine research of Jonas Salk as well as of his rival, Albert Sabin, was funded by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, later known as the March of Dimes. Salk convinced the US health authorities in 1954 that his polio vaccine contained only inactive virus (IPV), and was absolutely safe. He was able to convince the regulatory authorities that the “expensive and difficult procedures which had been suggested for the detection of possible residual live virus” in his vaccine should be dispensed with. Field trials of the Salk vaccine in 1954 were exposed by the Journal of the American Statistical Association: “…59 per cent of the trial was worthless because of the lack of adequate controls…” That report was ignored by the US Department of Health and the National Foundation proclaimed the Salk vaccine ready to mass distribute in spring of 1955.

Already in 1955 alarming results from the Salk vaccine had emerged. His vaccine, manufactured by Cutter Laboratories, was administered to over four hundred thousand people, mostly school children. Within days, reports of paralysis began surfacing. Within a month, the mass vaccination program against polio had to be suspended. In June of 1956, polio cases began to increase sharply in Chicago in children who had received the Salk vaccine. The National Foundation sent an urgent letter to its members urging them to, “give reassurance that the present Salk vaccine is safe and effective to patients, parents and others in your community who still needlessly doubt it…”

Salk’s vaccine had caused seventy thousand cases of muscle weakness, one hundred and sixty-four cases of severe paralysis and ten deaths. Three fourths of the victims remained permanently paralyzed. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare stepped down and the director of the NIH, resigned. The Cutter incident was quickly downplayed by the Government and vaccinations resumed after 21 days pause, using vaccines from Wyeth Labs. Those too produced cases of paralysis.

Between 1923 and 1953, before the Salk vaccine’s introduction, the polio death rate in the US had declined on its own by 47 percent; England had observed a similar pattern. Following the use of Salk’s vaccine between 1955 and 1963, cases of polio in the US increased—by 50 percent from 1957 to 1958, and by 80 percent between 1958 and 1959. This was concealed by a US Government change in defining polio, much as the WHO and CDC do today in Africa. Diseases that had previously been grouped together under the umbrella of “polio” began to be reported as separate diseases. One of these was aseptic or viral meningitis, an infectious disease that is difficult to distinguish from poliovirus, or transverse myelitis—a rare spinal cord inflammation, or the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Were all these a result of widespread toxins used in the vaccine? The Government and vaccine industry was not interested in knowing or telling.

Finally in 1963 the US Government replaced Salk’s IPV vaccine with an attenuated oral polio vaccine (OPV) developed by Albert Sabin. As a live virus vaccine, it, too, was and is capable of giving its recipients polio or polio symptoms. Salk testified before a Senate subcommittee in 1977 that the Sabin oral polio vaccine had caused most of the polio cases in the US since the early 1960s.

Rockefeller eugenics?

The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which funded both Salk and his rival Sabin in development of polio vaccines in the 1950’s, was run by two doctors from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research– Dr. Henry Kumm who had spent 23 years with the Rockefeller Institute, and Dr. Thomas Rivers.

Henry Kumm went over to the National Foundation in 1951 at the peak of the polio epidemic. In May 1953, Kumm became Director of Polio Research at NFIP. Notably, during World War II Kumm had served as civilian consultant to the Surgeon General of the US Army in Italy, directing field studies for the use of DDT against malarial mosquitoes.

Thomas Rivers was from 1922 head of the infectious disease ward at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, becoming the institute’s director in 1937. As chairman of committees on research and vaccine advisory for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, he oversaw the clinical trials of Jonas Salk’s vaccine by Dr Kumm’s group. It could be said that the National Foundation was a mask for a massive Rockefeller polio vaccine project.

Polio researcher David Oshisky stated, “In truth, polio was never the raging epidemic portrayed in the media, not even at its height in the 1940s and 1950s. Ten times as many children would die in accidents in those years, and three times as many would die of cancer. Polio’s special status was due, in large part, to the efforts of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, better known as the March of Dimes, which employed the latest techniques in advertising, fund raising and motivational research to turn a horrific but relatively uncommon disease in to the most feared affliction of its time. The genius of the National Polio Foundation lay in its ability to single out polio for special attention, making it seem more ominous than other diseases.” That National Foundation was run by Rockefeller doctors. This is very much what the Gates Foundation is doing with its turbo-charged oral polio vaccine in Africa where polio had almost vanished before the mass vaccine campaign of WHO and Gates.

Here the bond of dedication to eugenics and to dangerous vaccines seems to unite both the Rockefellers and Bill Gates, who in many ways is merely the heir and continuation of the deadly eugenics work of the Rockefellers. All this should give pause before regarding the pronouncements of Bill Gates on coronavirus and his favored vaccines as the scientific good truth.

"Faulty coronavirus tests: Goat, quail and papaya in Tanzania test positive for COVID-19, raising concerns about false positives","(Natural News) Coronavirus test kits in Tanzania have raised suspicions about their accuracy. President John Magufuli expressed during an event that he found them so unreliable due to the fact that certain animals and even a fruit have tested positive for COVID-19.

He further stated that the test kits were imported from overseas, but refused to specify where.

In order to evaluate the quality of the COVID-19 test kits, security forces in Tanzania obtained non-human samples from a goat, a papaya, a quail and even a sheep. The samples were assigned human names and then shipped off to a laboratory to be tested. Lab technicians who worked on the non-human samples weren’t informed about their true origins.

The test results showed that the goat, quail and papaya were found positive for COVID-19, which may have serious implications. According to Magufuli, this means some people could have received positive coronavirus test results despite not actually being infected.

This puts into question the country’s actual number of coronavirus cases. As of press time, the country has 509 reported cases of COVID-19, including 21 deaths. However, the actual number of cases could be higher because Tanzania goes days without providing updates.

A “dirty game” is going on in Tanzania’s coronavirus testing lab

Magufuli, who initially downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, suspended the head of testing at Tanzania’s national health laboratory on May 4, one day after he revealed that the lab had tested the non-human samples, noting that there was a “dirty game” going on at the laboratory.

Hassan Abbas, chief government spokesman of Tanzania, said that the country has formed a team to conduct further investigations on the laboratory that did the tests. They will release the results of their investigations as soon as they are complete. (Related: African coronavirus cases SPIKE by 43 percent – WHO warns that continent could be the “next epicenter” of the pandemic.)

“The equipment or people may be compromised and sometimes it can be sabotage,” said Magufuli in a speech broadcast through the country’s state-run news outlet.

Magufuli further cast doubt on the foreign aid Tanzania was receiving, saying that it may not always be “good for this nation” and that they shouldn’t accept all of it.

Coronavirus test kits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma

Africa’s testing capacity has expanded sharply since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the help of test kits procured from the WHO, the Jack Ma Foundation and other philanthropic organizations.

Jack Ma, Chinese billionaire and founder of the Alibaba Group, has donated thousands of test kits and protective gear to African nations. John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said that the Jack Ma Foundation had provided them with a lot of coronavirus test kits.

“We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries and providing them with test kits,” said Nkengasong. “We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.”

Nkengasong told journalists that the Africa CDC affirmed that the Tanzanian coronavirus test kits are “working very well.” The World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed their confidence in the reliability of the test kits.

When questioned regarding the veracity of the coronavirus tests, Matshidiso Moeti, head of WHO Africa, said that the tests procured through their organization and through the donations made by the Jack Ma Foundation were not contaminated with coronavirus.

Magufuli turns to alternative sources of aid for coronavirus

Losing any trust he had in the WHO and the Africa CDC, Magufuli has stated that he was sending a plane to Madagascar to collect an herbal mix that the country was touting as a cure for COVID-19. The herbal mix has not gone through internationally recognized scientific testing.

President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar has claimed that the herbal cure, known in the country as Covid-Organics, shows results within a week and that it has already cured two people so far.

Magufuli, in a speech, said that he was communicating with Madagascar regarding this COVID-19 cure. “They have got a medicine,” he said. “The medicine will be brought in the country so that Tanzanians, too, can benefit.”

"China made defective coronavirus test kits for Tanzania, reveals Africa CDC","(Natural News) The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) revealed Thursday that China was the source of the faulty coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits received by Tanzania. Prior to this, the origin of the test kits — which produced positive results when using samples from a goat and a pawpaw fruit — was unknown.

President John Magufuli ordered an investigation into the imported test kits Sunday. He stated that Tanzanian security forces randomly obtained non-human samples, including ones from pawpaw, a goat and a sheep, in order to evaluate the quality of the kits. These samples were then assigned human names and sent to a laboratory to test for the coronavirus.

Both the kits from the pawpaw and goat tested positive for COVID-19, according to Magufuli. The lab technicians handling the tests were deliberately not informed about the origins of the samples. Based on the results, Magufuli stated that faulty kits meant were marking some people as positive for the coronavirus even though they were not actually infected.

Africa CDC confirms China as the source of faulty kits

Dr. John Nkengasong, head of the Africa CDC, responded to the investigation Thursday. He said that the faulty test kits in question were imported to Africa from China, and then sent to Tanzania by the Africa CDC. These kits were donated by China through the Jack Ma Foundation, a charitable organization founded by billionaire Jack Ma.

Ma, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group and member of the Communist Party of China, has donated thousands of test kits, masks and protective gear to Africa, where the equipment is being used in nations across the continent. Aside from Tanzania, no other African countries have voiced any complaints about the test kits. (Related: Israel’s Health Ministry bans the use of Chinese coronavirus test kits,)

Nkengasong also commented on Magufuli’s allegation that the Africa CDC sent defective kits to Tanzania.

“We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries, and providing them with test kits,” stated the Africa CDC chief. “We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.”

Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, head of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Africa office, also reacted to Tanzania’s investigation of the test kits.

“We are convinced that the tests that have been provided … both through procurement through [WHO’s Africa office] and those that came through Jack Ma donations, were not contaminated with the virus,” Moeti said in a teleconference with journalists on Thursday.

Testing lab under investigation

Tanzania’s government has formed a team of experts to examine the lab that conducted the tests, stated chief government spokesman Hassan Abbas, and it would relay the outcome of the investigation, once results were in.

“What the president said was based on initial tests run by using animals … to test the veracity of the test results,” said Abbas. “Our worry was based on empirical findings. Once the team finalizes its work we will know the gravity of the lapses in the machines.”

Test issues could affect Africa’s efforts to fight COVID-19

If the veracity of Tanzania’s test on the kits is demonstrated, and the test kits or machines proved to be faulty, it’ll be a huge blow to testing efforts in Africa. While the continent’s testing capacity has expanded sharply, Africa has still only carried out around 685 tests per million people, according to Reuters. In comparison, Europe has carried out nearly 17 million tests, or just under 23,000 per million.

The WHO has warned that there could be as many as 10 million infections in the continent within the next six months. Additionally, Moeti has warned that the disease could “smoulder” in the region, becoming a fixture in the lives of Africans for years to come unless governments take a more proactive approach.

“While COVID-19 likely won’t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will [smolder] in transmission hotspots,” said Moeti. “COVID-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.”

As of press time, Tanzania has 509 cases of the coronavirus and 21 death, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Africa completely unprepared for COVID-19; death numbers could be staggering,"(Natural News) If you thought the coronavirus death toll in places like Italy, Spain and the U.S. was bad, it could really be a drop in the bucket compared to what might happen when the virus takes hold in Africa.

Although the 54 countries in Africa have reported less than 20,000 confirmed cases so far, the continent is considered to be weeks behind Europe, and the rate of increase seen in Europe looked quite similar to Africa’s numbers at this stage. The World Health Organization is warning that there could be mass devastation there given how woefully unprepared most countries are for a medical crisis of this magnitude.

In fact, for every million people in Africa, there are just five ICU beds. Hospital beds are also in short supply, with the entire continent having just 1.8 hospital beds for every 1,000 people; in France, there are 5.98 beds per 1,000 people.

Many Africans are unable to take the precautions that are keeping a lot of us in America and Europe safe, like frequent hand washing. More than half the population lives in highly overcrowded slum areas, and conditions like tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malnutrition are making lots of people there especially vulnerable. With 36 percent of Africans having no access to washing facilities at home, it’s not surprising that experts are predicting absolute devastation.

Social distancing measures have already been put in place in many African countries, with some issuing curfews and travel guidelines and others enacting full lockdowns. South Africa and Rwanda have declared a lockdown and banned unnecessary movements. Uganda has closed its borders, imposed a curfew and banned public transport, while Kenya has also imposed a curfew and restricted movement among populated areas. Nigeria, meanwhile, has imposed lockdowns in key cities like Lagos.

Without additional intervention, The UN Economic Commission for Africa is warning that more than 1.2 billion Africans could become infected with the disease and 33 million could die before the end of the year; the total population on the continent is 1.3 billion. Their best-case scenario would still see the continent registering 122.8 million infections and 300,000 deaths.

They’ve also estimated that as many as 29 million people could be pushed below what is considered the extreme poverty line on account of the virus.

Although Africa, like other continents, will suffer greatly from this disease, there is one small comfort, and that’s the fact that much of its population is young. When you look at the high mortality rate of Italy, it’s important to take into account the fact that 23 percent of that country’s population is older than 65 and therefore falls into the category of highest risk. In Africa, on the other hand, just 2 percent of the population is older than 65. That may help stem the mortality rate to some extent.

Will the coronavirus measures that work elsewhere be effective in Africa?

Some experts have expressed concern that lockdowns might not work as well in many places in Africa as they do in Europe and America. Many people there live day to day and depend on the cash they earn in the market to buy their food, so even a few days of lockdown could plunge them into starvation. Many people may prefer to take their chances and possibly become infected rather than take on the certainty of starvation. Past lockdowns like those meant to curb Ebola in Liberia in 2014 were a disaster and didn’t stop the disease from spreading.

It’s a very complicated situation made worse by the fact that much-needed medical supplies are already in short supply around the world. Countries that might normally come to Africa’s aid during health crises are already struggling with their own problems, and help may be very hard to find.

"Google and Facebook are engineered to spread fear about infections, to keep the public ignorant of how the immune system works","(Natural News) In order to control a person’s mind, alter their behavior, and manipulate their emotions and reactions, that person must first be made ignorant and left feeling helpless, with no way to apply knowledge and independently solve their own problems. In their ignorance, a person is made to feel helpless, abiding by authority’s controls to feel safe. As they give away their own power over their life, they become easily controlled and manipulated. This manipulation leads to compliant, subservient behaviors that serve the interests of those who seek to control, of those who seek to govern over others and poison them for profit.

Big Tech – Google, Facebook etc. – are engineering mass ignorance

Imagine what it would look like if a select entity had the power to make entire populations ignorant – ignorant of their own body, mind and immune system. Imagine if people were told they were facing a “new virus” that they knew nothing about, that their body was incapable of facing. Imagine a feat of manipulation carried out en masse — human minds molded, emotions controlled. This is the reality that is being engineered by Big Tech – primarily Google and Facebook. These entities have created platforms of manipulation that are being used to censor out the most important information on the human immune system, leaving populations clueless and weak, so they can be more readily controlled.

Google has a monopoly on data and uses this data to manipulate what people subconsciously interact with online, what they see in advertisements, and what they are allowed to access in searches and news feeds. Google is already more powerful in terms of its control over people’s lives than almost every government on the planet. For example, go to the Google search engine, type in any three digit number followed by “cases.” Virtually every three digit number will pull up multiple stories about that number of coronavirus cases. It’s all about spreading fear of infection, instead of providing knowledge on how people can live normally and give their body what it needs to overcome potential infections.

Google has devolved from an open access search engine, to a manipulative platform of thought control. According to Google whistleblowers, Google maintains a blacklist, deciding what people can and cannot search for, while burying important information on health topics. Google and Facebook admit they only allow an official narrative to persist on infectious disease. All information that is allowed must be approved and rubber stamped by the World Health Organization.

Dr. Robert Epstein, a behavioral scientist, testified before Congress explaining how Google can use data manipulation and algorithms to manipulate the minds of more than 15 million people in a subsequent election. “And the methods they’re using are invisible, they are subliminal, they are more powerful than most any effects I’ve ever seen in the behavioral science and I’ve been in the behavioral science for almost forty years.”

Censorship and blacklisting of knowledge makes populations vulnerable to pharmaceutical agendas

Zach Vorhies, Google whistle blower and engineer, went public about Google’s internal search engine, which blacklists search terms such as “cancer cures.” Google actively blocks cancer survivor testimony suppressing how cancer can be overcome and burying a vast wealth of scientific studies and knowledge on anti-cancer compounds. This same manipulation is being carried out to spread fear about infections and to keep the public ignorant on how their immune system works. Some of the most important voices have been censored from Big Tech in 2020 because they seek to quell infection fears and provide information that can help people overcome health challenges that plague their mind and body.

As for Facebook: its fact checking arm, PolitiFact, is owned by the Poynter Institute, which has received substantial funding from pharmaceutical companies, Google, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. These controllers use Facebook to censor information that can be applied in the home at the onset of an infection and in the hospital system to speed up recovery, prevent complications and save lives from infectious disease. By blocking information on treatment options and keeping the public ignorant on how their immune system works, these pharmaceutical companies and globalists with a psychopathic plot to vaccinate 7 billion people can more readily carry out their nefarious agendas.

Trump setting the stage for wartime retaliation against communist China regime for launching biological weapon attack against the United States,"(Natural News) President Trump and top Trump administration officials are setting the stage for wartime retaliation against communist China for China’s launching of biological warfare against the United States. The goal of this effort is to cause the collapse of the communist regime, which is widely known as the most evil, dishonest and malicious government on the planet.

Consider what we know so far:

The Wuhan coronavirus was engineered in the Wuhan virology lab in communist China.

The virus was deliberately engineered with “gain-of-function” properties to infect and kill humans.

After releasing the virus, the Chinese government desperately sought to hide its origins by destroying evidence and executing whistleblowers.

At the same time, communist China was conspiring with the WHO to make sure the rest of the world would have a delayed response to the virus by refusing to declare the pandemic a “pandemic.”

During all this, China was aggressively buying up PPE supplies all around the world, making sure other nations would experience extreme shortages in masks and other protective equipment as they tried to handle accelerating outbreaks.

China also leaned on the WHO to criticize any national efforts to block flights from China, characterizing such moves as “racist.” This allowed infected Chinese to rapidly spread the virus around the world.

Even as its own people were widely infected, China continued to run hundreds of flights per day to major cities around the world, including Madrid, Paris, London, New York, Los Angeles, Rio Grande and even Moscow. This was China’s way of exporting the pandemic to other nations .

. China’s goals of disrupting the US economy, hurting Trump’s chances of re-election and creating economic chaos were all achieved in just a few months.

China launched a biological “Pearl Harbor” against the United States

Now, President Trump has correctly described the Wuhan coronavirus attack as a “Pearl Harbor” against the United States, saying, “This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center.” That’s important language to recognize, because it’s the language of war. Similarly, in numerous White House pandemic press briefings, Trump has referred to the pandemic as a “war.”

Now, we can add Peter Navarro’s comments to the mix, with Navarro saying recently on Fox & Friends:

“We are at war, make no mistake about that. The Chinese unleashed a virus on the world.”

As RT reports:

The rhetoric against China from both Republicans and White House officials has become especially accusatory in recent days.

This is on top of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repeatedly insisting there is “enormous evidence” that the Wuhan coronavirus was engineered in a Chinese lab. He also warns that China tried to hide the origins of the virus.

As The Independent reports:

Mr Pompeo’s statements about the origins of the virus mirror the words of his boss, Donald Trump, who claimed last Thursday that he has seen evidence the coronavirus originated from a medical laboratory in Wuhan.

“We can confirm that the Chinese Communist Party did all that it could to make sure that the world didn’t learn in a timely fashion about what was taking place,” Mr Pompeo said. “We’ve seen the fact that they kicked the journalists out. We saw the fact that those who were trying to report on this, medical professionals inside of China, were silenced. They shut down reporting.In March, Beijing tightened its censorship process surrounding medical research of the virus and its origins. It has also taken down various scientific research papers on the virus that were previously published on the web.”

Finally, former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, an extremely high-IQ individual who has deep intelligence contacts in Taiwan, is now saying the communist regime (CCP) is headed for collapse.

In an interview with The Epoch Times, Bannon says: (emphasis added)

We don’t have to have the economy in China collapse. What we have to do is have the Chinese communist party collapse…

You may have some perturbations as China reorganizes and gets a new government. It will be like Eastern Europe and these places after the fall of the Soviet union. But think how great it would be with the Chinese people being free, having democracy and having true freedom and not having to have a firewall, not having to have social credit scores and not having everybody like the great hero, Dr. Li (who had to) face torture and had to sign a confession that he was a rumor monger. All that goes away. May the economy go down slightly? Yeah. The economy may go down. It’s not going to be perfect at first, but look, the economy is collapsing in China anyway because of the actions of the Chinese communist party and what they did in this pandemic.

The first quarter in China has been terrible. The second quarter has been terrible. The factories aren’t back up and the workers don’t feel safe. Remember we have another whole wave of this in China and it’s not affecting the guys in Beijing because they have total quarantine. If you go out to the fifth ring or sixth ring, you can’t get back into the area around the forbidden city. It’s like a quarantine, right? Because they want to protect themselves. They know how deadly this virus is. So this shows you the hypocrisy of the leadership of the Chinese communist party.

That’s what this pandemic, the good that can come out of this pandemic is the freedom of the Chinese people. And people have to understand if you support the Chinese communist party, you’re racist, if you support the Chinese communist party, you’re a xenophobe because you are supporting the worst people on earth to suppress the 1.4 billion people in China. And you’re going to be held accountable. Anybody that backs the regime is going to be held accountable. Okay? There’s absolutely no doubt this regime is going to fall. Just like the Nazis fell just like Mussolini and the fascists fell, just like the commissars and the Soviet union fell. They always fall. The Chinese communist party is the next one to get kicked into the dustbin of history.

It begs the question: Does Bannon know something about imminent action against China?

It’s all leading up to war against China

The upshot of all this is that Trump and his top officials are setting the stage for retaliatory action against China. Any form of retaliation would be justified under the truth that China launched the first attack wave against the United States by releasing the Wuhan coronavirus and then deliberately spreading it around the world, including to the United States.

The bioweapons attack has caused trillions of dollars in economic damage in the United States alone, and it has killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world — a number that will almost certainly turn to millions of deaths once the virus completes its rampage across Africa, Mexico and South America.

When attacked with a weapon of mass destruction from an enemy nation, the United States has many options for retaliatory strikes:

Economic weapons such as embargoes and trade restrictions.

Financial weapons such as nullifying US Treasuries held by China.

Geopolitical weapons such as increasing weapon funding and supply for Taiwan.

In an even more enticing scenario, the USA could end its official recognition of China and switch its recognition to Taiwan as the rightful China.

Cyber weapons, including cyber attacks on China’s infrastructure.

Kinetic weapons, including targeted cruise missile strikes on China’s virology labs.

Nuclear weapons, which might include tactical nukes that target communist government strongholds.

What’s clear is that before war is initiated, a war of words is used to establish the justification of the real war to follow. And that war of words is what we’re seeing now from Navarro, Pompeo and Trump himself. It’s a strong indication that acts of war are in the works and might be deployed without warning.

My recent interview with JR Nyquist provides further evidence that war with China may be imminent:

Once China collapses, so will the Big Tech censorship regime that takes orders from Beijing

It is time, after all, for the world to isolate communist China and deliberately work to achieve the collapse of that evil, anti-human regime. The collapse of China would also set off enormous shockwaves of freedom around the world as China’s puppets — which include Google, Facebook, Twitter, the Vatican and more — all experience a simultaneous disconnect from the commie bosses who tell them what to do.

At least one-third of the US Congress would also experience sudden withdrawal, as they are communist puppets who do the bidding of China. And Sen. Feinstein’s office in California would find itself with nothing to do, since it only serves the interests of China, too.

The bottom line is that communist China’s existence is irreconcilable with human freedom, and the implosion of the communist regime would not only set free the 1.4 billion Chinese who live under the oppression of tyranny, it would also end communist China’s infiltration and control over countless institutions around the world that are now allied against humanity: Big Tech, the Vatican, US universities, the US Congress, Hollywood and so on.

In essence, China is the greatest enemy of humanity, and if Trump, Pompeo and others were to find a way to obliterate the communist Chinese regime while freeing the Chinese people, it would be the greatest gift to humankind that we could possibly imagine.

Cold war brewing between the US and China as coronavirus outbreak spreads,"(Natural News) The tensions that have mounted since the start of the global coronavirus pandemic have slowly pushed the U.S. and China closer to a new cold war. The political pressures stemming from the pandemic have strengthened hard-liners while making it harder for leaders to back away from escalation.

As the virus has killed thousands and savaged economies around the world, officials in Washington and Beijing have continued to heap blame on each other for the virus. Early on, President Donald Trump often referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus.”

Meanwhile, Chinese state-owned media and political operatives have slammed the statements of America’s political elites as being “racist and xenophobic.” Beijing has even gone as far as to spin allegations that the epidemic was started by the U.S. military.

The outbreak is stirring anger in both countries

Officials in Washington have quietly pressed for international censure of China’s culpability in the ongoing pandemic. At the same time, they’ve seized upon the crisis to attack the manufacturing and other economic ties that have been built between the countries over the past 40 years.

As the outbreak shut down imports from China, many companies found themselves unable to procure the goods they needed to sell to make money. As a result, many U.S. companies started to rethink their supply chains and make plans to move their manufacturing outside of China before the economy ground to a halt.

All the while, the tariffs that President Trump imposed on billions of dollars worth of goods from China — and corresponding counter-tariffs from Beijing — remain in place. This has added to the cost of trade while many businesses struggle to stay afloat.

The economic toll seems to have pushed bipartisan support for President Trump’s anti-China message in both Congress and in corporate America. Many in the latter have long been disillusioned with the relationship, especially as Beijing continues to refuse to prevent its companies from appropriating the intellectual property and know-how of American firms.

Another factor contributing to the growing disenfranchisement with China has been Beijing’s continued crackdowns on dissent and human rights, as well as its aggressive military moves in the South China Sea.

In China, on the other hand, U.S. criticism of the country, as well as the economic toll inflicted by the tariffs, has also stirred waves of nationalistic resentment toward the latter.

This anger, combined with the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) massive response to fight the epidemic, seems to have strengthened President Xi Jinping’s hold on power, making it easier for him to pursue further crackdowns on dissent.

People in China also chafe at President Trump’s effort to blame the pandemic on the nation, seeing it as both unfair and factually wrong. To them, the CPC’s draconian isolation of Hubei province and other hot spots is a model for how to contain and conquer the disease. They also see China as having reached out to other countries to help them as its own crisis has seemingly abated. (Related: “Recovered” coronavirus patients in China are testing positive a second time.)

According to David Bachman, a China specialist at the University of Washington in Seattle, the widely accepted narrative within China is that the country is “if not the savior of the world — at least sort of doing more than its fair share to help the rest of the world.”

On both sides, public resentment is likely to be intensified by the rising economic cost of the pandemic.

Economic pain could make compromise more difficult

The economies of both nations are expected to see their sharpest drops in decades, as businesses get crippled, and millions of people lose their jobs. Political leaders face an unprecedented crisis in which conventional stimulus packages and other time-honored economic policies look to be ineffective.

According to analysts, the economic pain will likely make it difficult for both sides to make any compromise, even if a de-escalation could benefit both of them.

“I don’t think there’s any way in hell things get better from here,” said Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “An increasingly authoritarian China, mixed with a global growth downturn, mixed with a domestic recession, mixed with a populist president, mixed with an election year, equals an increasingly factious discourse on China.”

China’s economy is expected to suffer its slowest growth in more than 40 years. This could threaten the country’s political stability if the CPC fails to make good on its compact with the masses to continue to improve their economic well-being in exchange for their compliance with an often oppressive authoritarian system.

However, there are signs that China’s economy could fare better than experts in the West are projecting. According to Nicolas Lardy, a China economy expert at the Petersen Institute for International Economics, Chinese factories have resumed their operations, and power usage has returned to 95 percent of what it was this time last year.

In addition to this, Beijing hasn’t felt the need to spur economic growth with massive credit, nor has it provided anything close to the $2 trillion relief package that Washington passed. Had Beijing thought they were headed to a major economic downturn, Lardy explained, they would have injected a lot more stimulus than it already has.

Coronavirus killed the trade deal that could have eased tensions

Back in January, there was some hope that tensions would be eased thanks to a large trade deal struck by the two sides. As part of the deal, the Chinese promised to buy millions of dollars more in American farm products and other goods.

Thanks to the pandemic, however, that trade deal “is already dead in the water,” states Backman. “There’s no possible way that the targets now are going to be met. And so that’s going to be a source of dissatisfaction on the U.S. side.”

The global pandemic “has demonstrated the impossibility of the U.S. and China being coupled closely together,” explained Clyde Prestowitz, former counselor to the Secretary of Commerce during the Reagan administration. “The notion that free trade and globalization are going to tame China and make it more democratic, etcetera, I think this has shown that’s bull.”

"NIH spent more than $700 million in taxpayer money to develop coronavirus pharmaceuticals, vaccines and bioweapons","(Natural News) For the past almost 20 years, the United States government has been using your tax dollars (assuming you’re an American taxpayer) to fund research and development into vaccines and other pharmaceuticals for the coronavirus family of pathogens. And if history is any indicator, the end result of this massive financial disbursement will be obscene profits for Big Pharma, and expensive drugs for you and your family.

A new report by Public Citizen explains that the “race” has been on to develop new drug-based treatments for coronaviruses ever since the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis of 2002, followed by MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) in 2012, and now the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19).

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the report explains, has played a “singular role” in making sure that your hard-earned income makes it into the coffers of the pharmaceutical industry, which continues to argue that its monopoly-based patent system for synthetic treatments “is the most effective tool to reward and incentivize innovation.”

Big Pharma further argues that, despite having to rely upon the general public to fund its self-centered R&D efforts, this is all worthwhile because it “fulfills the promise of breakthroughs in treatments and cures for … scores of debilitating or life-threatening illnesses around the world.”

Keep in mind that unpatented natural remedies remain largely off-limits because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is bed-buddies with Big Pharma, prohibits their use under the guise that they’re “unsubstantiated” and “unproven” for medicinal use.

The only option, in other words, are patented synthetics, which wouldn’t even exist were it not for back-door dealings that transfer the wealth of American taxpayers into the coffers of the pharmaceutical industry, which Public Citizen argues isn’t even putting it to good use when it comes to the fight against infectious diseases.

“… the monopoly model has not driven significant industry investment in infectious diseases, including coronaviruses,” the report explains. “Last year, there were only six active coronavirus clinical trials involving pharmaceutical companies. All of them depended crucially on public funding.”

Listen below as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how the release of the new Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) was an intentional deployment by communist China of a deadly bioweapon aimed at the destruction of America:

Big Pharma doesn’t care about helping people, only about lining its pockets with cash

The problem with trying to fight infectious diseases using the typical pharmaceutical model is that there’s much more profit to be had in developing “blockbuster” treatments for persistent illnesses as opposed to isolated outbreaks. Thus, Big Pharma is almost solely focused on the latter, public health be damned.

When it comes to the fundamentals of the pharmaceutical industry, in other words, it’s all about the money, baby. Big Pharma executives couldn’t care less if millions or even billions of people die, just so long as the profits continue to flow from other lucrative drug offerings, including childhood vaccines that are now mandated in many areas with minimal exceptions.

Now, if Big Pharma can somehow be assured by Big Fed that people will be forced at gunpoint to receive a patented coronavirus vaccine at some point in the future, then that’s a whole different story. If this were the case, every pharmaceutical company in America would be rushing to create their own varieties due to the surety of windfall profits.

“The public sector has helped drive the CoVid-19 response,” Public Citizen states. “We cannot rely on industry’s monopoly model to deliver the medicines we need.”

"The same media liars who ran total fearmonger stories over the MEASLES nonsense are now claiming the coronavirus pandemic is nothing, and that WE are fearmongers","(Natural News) Every time anybody in America gets the measles, the mass media go into their scripted frenzy, and the vaccine industry pushes out their propaganda via the CDC hub of lies and deception. Get the measles vaccine or catch the measles and die from the measles – that’s the message. Then CNN and WebMD plaster pictures of some worse-case scenario, probably from the 1970s or something, and we’re all supposed to panic and run out for the latest MMR II combo jab full of neurotoxins, including MSG and human abortion cells.

Now, with coronavirus infecting more than 70,000 and killing at least 1700, we’re all told it’s contained and quarantined. It’s all under control so just go back to work at the factory, pay those taxes and keep spending the rest of your money on beer, corn sugar, and pharmaceuticals. That’s right: CoVid-19 isn’t like the measles yet, because there’s no vaccine to sell to the public, all laced with everything that makes you sick, dumb and more susceptible to the “killer cold.”

The “killer cold” virus pandemic is infecting us – should we all panic?

That’s what it is, you know, this latest version of a mutated nightmare that was genetically modified and mutated in a lab and then stolen or sold to the highest bidder. It’s a killer cold virus, like the flu, but the people who are dying off are those who already have decimated immune systems from eating toxins, drinking chemical water, breathing pollution, getting injected with vaccines, and taking flora-destroying prescription medications. Is it sinking in yet? – the fact that measles is considered one of the deadliest diseases by the sick care industry of the USA, but coronavirus is nothing to worry about, question, or even talk about?

The money-making machine (a toxic immunization jab that doesn’t work) hasn’t been “patented” and released to the public, so go right out and catch that killer cold. Pay no attention to the 400 million people quarantined in China. It’s all under control over there, just like the nuclear radioactive wastewater at the Fukushima plant in Japan. Nothing to see here. Go back to work America.

They say the best way to end the measles scare is to just catch it, and be done with it forever, so what about CoVid-19?

So, who are the real conspiracy theorists now? The mass media and sick care industry never tell the truth about immunity. That is one thing we know for sure. They tell us babies have no immune system at all and need 60 vaccines by age 6 to even survive. They tell us all elderly people are weak, with brittle bones, compromised immune systems, and that dementia is natural aging and it’s inherited. Can you say population control?

We’re all supposed to be scared to death of the the measles, flu, Zika virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), and even chicken pox. There’s a vaccine for everything, and if you don’t get it, you are a science denier, a vaccine skeptic, a threat to human life on Earth. Now, don’t look, but coronavirus is set to infect 80 percent of the population of this planet, and guess who’s more likely to die from this killer cold? Oh, the hypocrisy of Western Medicine.

So, let’s say tomorrow there’s an outbreak of the Measles at Disney Land or Disney World or in a Disney Movie — should we all rush out and get a new measles shot, even though it’s the vaccination itself that helps spread the disease via human shedders? Maybe that’s EXACTLY how the globalists plan on spreading CoVid-19 coronavirus, by making everyone paranoid and emotional one day so they’ll all rush out and get injected with the killer cold virus. This, my friends, looks like biological warfare purposely waged.

You can thank the Chinese Communist Party for the coronavirus epidemic,"(Natural News) Meeting with the head of the World Health Organization Tuesday, President Xi Jinping did his best to pretend that the deadly coronavirus epidemic now raging in China was under control. “I have been in command” of the situation from the beginning, he said. His government would “release information on the virus in a timely manner,” because “The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide.”

(Article by Steven W. Mosher republished from LifeSiteNews.com)

Listening to Xi, you don’t know whether to laugh or cry.

The truth is that Communist Party officials have been playing “hide the demon” for two months now. For weeks after the first coronavirus cases were reported, they pretended that it didn’t exist.

Then we were told that the coronavirus originated in an open-air market, where animals were being slaughtered for sale to customers who like their wild game fresh. Perhaps. But there have also been suggestions that the virus may have escaped from a People’s Liberation Army Biowarfare unit located just a few miles away from the epicenter of the epidemic.

Either way, the first wave of cases in December was hushed up.

Even when the number of people who had come down with the coronavirus became too large to hide by early January, officials continually minimized the seriousness of the disease to their own people—and to the world.

In the meantime, because they were not given timely information about the seriousness of the problem, the people of Wuhan went on contracting and spreading the virus among themselves for weeks. Then, just as the virus was reaching epidemic proportions in Wuhan, the Chinese New Year began.

Every year, the largest migration on the planet takes place in China. By long tradition, hundreds of millions of people go home for the lunar new year celebrations.

In the days leading up to the holiday, no fewer than five million residents of Wuhan got in cars, buses, trains, and planes and went home for the holidays. The effect of this diaspora was to carry the coronavirus to every corner of China, and to many surrounding countries as well. It is an epidemiological nightmare.

Only after the first cases of coronavirus were being reported in a dozen other Chinese cities did deceitful Communist officials finally impose a quarantine on Wuhan’s 11 million people. They have since expanded it to some 17 other cities in Hubei province with a total population of 40-plus million. It is the largest quarantine in human history—but it is still too little and too late. This is the real scandal.

Even today, as the epidemic has spread throughout China, the Chinese authorities are still lying—about the number of infections, about the number of deaths, and maybe even about the origins of the deadly virus. The claim that there have been to date only 170 deaths and 7,700 infections is laughable given the other reports that are coming out of the country.

Take the January 28 directive issued by China’s Ministry of Public Security, which ordered all police departments throughout the country to make “wartime preparations.” The police are to help “control the disease” by enforcing quarantine orders and helping to speed the distribution of medical supplies, while at the same time “maintaining social stability” by “severely” punishing any public or online reporting about the spread of the epidemic.

Does that sound like China is on the verge of declaring a national emergency to you? It does to me.

Despite the police clampdown on social media reports on the epidemic, a few hints of how bad things really are have managed to leak out from behind the Great Firewall. Consider this stunner from the Wuhan authorities.

“The [Wuhan] city government and Hubei Provincial Civil Affairs Ministry have dispatched vehicles, staff, and protective gear to each funeral house [in Wuhan].” The post went on to offer “free cremation for the corpses of coronavirus victims” who died on January 26 or later.

The reason the city was deploying these new resources, it said, was “To improve the capacity of transporting and dealing with corpses” (!).

I don’t know about you, but this doesn’t sound to me like something they would do if the official death toll of 170 or so was anywhere close to accurate. The post obviously didn’t please the censors either, because an hour later the above sentences were deleted from the text.

As far as Xi himself, until now he has maintained a sphinxlike silence on the epidemic that has the province of Hubei in a death grip, even as lower-level officials like Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang have had to fall on their swords. Two days ago Chinese premier Li Keqiang finally visited the city, but Xi still hasn’t gone himself.

Any other world leader who did not personally visit the scene of such an unfolding disaster would be crucified in his national media. Xi has little to worry about on that front, however, since his state-controlled media exists not to report the news, but to make him and the Party look good.

Of course, with long lines of the sick lining up outside hospitals, that’s getting increasingly hard to do.

General Secretary Xi Jinping may speak of the “demon,” but in the view of many in China, the “demon” is hiding in plain sight. It is the Chinese Communist Party itself, and the culture of corruption and deceit that it has fostered.

One final comment: The Chinese Party-State probably spends a trillion dollars a year monitoring and surveilling, policing and re-educating its population. The cost of incarcerating over a million Uyghurs in concentration camps alone must run into the tens of billions. The cost of persecuting tens of millions of Catholics and other Christians probably runs billions more.

If they put a fraction of the money they spend on their police state into public health, and actually “released information in a timely manner,” as Xi promised, they would have been able to stop this epidemic in its tracks.

But that’s not the way that Leftists roll, is it?

Fortunately, those of us in the West live in democracies, with an open and free press, and health officials who put people, rather than politics, first. The few cases of the disease we now have will be effectively contained and Xi’s “demon” will pass us by.

But pity the poor Chinese.

"US military pandemic plans activated; nation must prepare for “thousands of cases” of the coronavirus to arrive, warns biowarfare expert","(Natural News) Over the last two weeks, I have repeatedly warned that the nCoV coronavirus strain is right now being harvested by enemies of America (North Korea, Iran, China, etc.) and readied for deployment as a weapon system against the United States of America. Until today, I seem to have been the only person in the world who dared point out the obvious.

But now, the executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, speaking at a Senate Home Security committee just yesterday, confirmed this obvious point, saying, “We have to plan for the possibility that we have thousands of cases.”

His name is Asha George, and he was one of five experts who testified before the U.S. Senate, reports The Epoch Times. Another expert was former FDA director Scott Gottlieb, who warned that unrestrained immigration would bring the virus to America:

We should be leaning in very aggressively to try to broaden diagnostic screening right now, particularly in communities where there is a lot of immigration; where these efforts could emerge to identify them early enough; that they’ll be small enough; that we can intervene to prevent more epidemic spread in this country.

Gottlieb also added that because the virus spread during its asymptomatic incubation phase, airport screening is only catching 1 out of every 4 infections. This means airport screening, just as we have repeated warned here, is largely just “security theater.”

U.S. military Northern Command issues executive order to prepare the military for a global coronavirus pandemic

In addition to various U.S. officials warning the Senate about the coming wave of coronavirus infections, the United States military, Northern Command, just issued an executive order commanding troops to initiate military pandemic plans, according to an article published in MilitaryTimes.com.

The plans, “include ordering commanders to prepare for widespread outbreaks and confining service members with a history of travel to China,” reports Military Times:

The Navy and Marine Corps messages, issued Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, reference an executive order directing U.S. Northern Command to implement the Department of Defense Global Campaign plan for Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Diseases 3551-13.

The document serves as the Pentagon’s blueprint for planning and preparing for widespread dispersion of influenza and previously unknown diseases.

U.S. Northern Command said Wednesday it was directed the Joint Staff Feb. 1 to commence “prudent planning” in their assigned role synchronizing the department’s plans for pandemic flu and disease.

The global pandemic just got militarized, in other words.

China just essentially declared military martial law and activated a full military response against the coronavirus pandemic

Making things even more interesting, China’s CDC just issued a series of military orders that essentially place the entire nation under military martial law.

Detailed in this executive order released by the Chinese government, China’s new “wartime” declaration calls on biological weapons laboratories in China to “put an end to pathogenic samples being stolen, leaked or lost.”

Much of China’s declaration centers around wartime commands that demand absolute loyalty and zero errors in logistics and control of local regions. Here’s a rough translation from one of the directives (directive five):

The current situation of epidemic prevention and control is extremely serious, the responsibility of prevention and control is heavier than that of Mount Tai. With the coming battle, all Party branches should think and launch, unite the masses and commit fully to the role of battle fortress; cadres at all levels should lead by example, dare to take on the role and give full commitment to the leading role; and each Party member should rush forward, shoulder the heavy burden, and give full commitment to the role of pioneer and model. All Party branches, branches and cadres at all levels should earnestly fulfill their main responsibilities, and the disciplinary committee shall fulfill its supervisory responsibilities to ensure the smooth flow of decrees and the prohibition of the operation.

If you can make any sense of that, you might fit in well with a communist society, which at its core is rooted in total insanity and delusion. In fact, the very structure of communism makes society highly vulnerable to pandemics, since no truth tellers are allowed to warn anyone about the outbreak. Censorship gets people killed, both in communist China and in the USA where the evil tech giants are also complicit in covering up the truth about the coronavirus pandemic.

Bottom line: Governments of the world know this is going global and they are activating their military forces to be prepared for anything

So, as is now becoming rather obvious, the coronavirus pandemic is going global. Every nation that’s paying attention is ordering its military to activate pandemic readiness measures.

U.S. military commanders and national defense experts are already well aware that the coronavirus will inevitably be deployed against the United States of America as a biological weapon. They are also aware that deliberate contamination efforts cannot be stopped in any way whatsoever. There is no defense against an infected person covertly entering the USA and walking around a city, infecting public surfaces and shared air in public transport vessels such as trains or subways.

This means America will almost certainly find itself in a rapidly worsening pandemic situation in the coming months, and medical martial law will no doubt be declared in the USA as well. Expect full-blown quarantines, gunpoint arrests of suspected carriers, the complete revocation of all civil rights (including the Second Amendment, if they can get away with it) and mandatory coronavirus vaccines once commercial availability is met.

In other words, America will sooner or later be turned into a medical police state, and everybody at the highest levels of the government, the CDC and the military is already fully aware of this. Just like in China, quarantine death camps will be called “hospitals,” too.

No one in a position of power will admit the truth, because the public can’t handle the truth

As all this is unfolding at the highest levels, the public is being kept in the dark so that they “don’t panic” by learning the truth.

We’re basically in a situation where a metaphorical 100-mile wide asteroid is plunging toward New York City at a relative velocity of 10,000 m/s, and the impact is triple confirmed but nobody in the government wants to alarm the public, since it’s pointless to warn people about an event of such magnitude. (That would be a planetary extinction event.)

The coronavirus won’t cause mass extinction, but it could very easily cause devastating, even catastrophic disruptions to human-driven economies, resulting in waves of death, chaos and instability that threaten the very existence of ruling governments. Once the full impact of the virus becomes realized, today’s delusional stock market bubble will absolutely implode, and that’s a result the Trump administration doesn’t want to see happen, at least not before the election.

Things are about to get very interesting, in other words. Plus, it’s an election year, and that’s when the party in power wants to project the illusion that everything’s awesome.

Truth be told, everything isn’t awesome. In fact, it’s downright apocalyptic to anyone who can do the math and see where this is going.

Just remember, we told you first. Now everybody else in the establishment media is catching up, as usual. If you want to stay ahead of the sheeple, read NaturalNews.com to get the news today that the rest of the media will finally come to realize two weeks later.",2/13/20 0:00,
Sen. Cotton DEMANDS China prove that coronavirus isn’t a biological weapon as outbreak continues to spread and kill,"(Natural News) In recent days, the very same Left-wing establishment media beholden to the deep state and for years reported the “Trump-Russia collusion” hoax even in the face of conflicting evidence were triggered by suggestions that the coronavirus could be part of a Chinese biological weapon that simply got away from the People’s Liberation Army.

But this week the questions over whether the virus is linked to a dangerous weapons program belonging to Beijing are getting a second look, and from none other than a Republican senator not noted for crazy conspiracies or hyperbole.

As Zero Hedge reports, Sen. Tom Cotton, a former U.S. Army infantry officer with two combat tours and a law degree from Harvard, raised the issue anew as China continues to try to contain the spread of the virus, which has now reached the United States.

Indeed, adding further credence to the theory, a pair of ‘mainstream’ financial publications have also raised the question, the news site noted: Is coronavirus a Chinese bioweapon?

Zero Hedge noted:

Is it merely a coincidence that the Canadian scientist at the center of a bio-espionage probe was recently found dead in Africa, as we reported last week? Or that a doctor who helped draft a critical international bioweapons convention has said that the virus might be tied to “biological warfare?”

Or an Israeli bioweapons expert?

Cotton believes that Chinese leaders must step up and answer these and other questions, especially after he was accused of engaging in “xenophobia” against Chinese people — a ridiculous assertion and one meant only to deflect — by China’s Ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai.

In fact, as The National Sentinel reported this week, Cui was asked about Cotton’s concerns regarding a potential bioweapon on a Sunday network news magazine and pointedly did not directly deny it.

Outbreak of virus occurred near location of a ‘super lab’

CBS News’ Margaret Brennan said to the ambassador, “That’s an extraordinary charge. How do you respond to that?”

“I think it’s true that a lot is still unknown and our scientists, Chinese scientists, American scientists, scientists of other countries are doing their best to learn more about the virus, but it’s very harmful,” Cui said.

“It’s very dangerous to stir up suspicion, rumors and spread them among the people. For one thing, this will create panic. Another thing that it will fend up racial discrimination, xenophobia, all these things, that will really harm our joint efforts to combat the virus,” he continued.

“Of course, there are all kinds of speculation and rumors,” Cui said. “There are people who are saying that these virus are coming from some- some military lab, not of China, maybe in the United States. How — how can we believe all these crazy things?”

When pressed by Brennan as to where the virus did come form, Cui answered, “We still don’t know yet.”

So — not a real denial.

China's ambassador to the United States just went on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" and DID NOT deny that coronavirus stemmed from the Chinese military's biological warfare program. Amb. Cui Tiankai then suggested that the virus could come from a US military lab. pic.twitter.com/z2g254iccz — Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) February 9, 2020

On a separate-but-related subject, Cui was also asked by Brennan about what happened to Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who disappeared after he began covering the outbreak of the virus at ground zero in Wuhan City.

His response: “I have never heard of this guy, so I don’t have any information to share with you.”

But a U.S. journalist knew about ‘this guy.’

As for Cotton, he took to Twitter to make some statements of his own. For instance, he pointed out the “fact” the Chinese government lied about the coronavirus starting in a Wuhan food market.

[email protected], here’s what’s not a conspiracy, not a theory: Fact: China lied about virus starting in Wuhan food market https://t.co/Jgpy1Oh75Y — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 9, 2020

He also noted another “fact” that a “super-lab” just happens to be located a few miles from the market.

“Where did it start? We don’t know. But the burden of proof is on you & fellow communists,” he wrote.”

Why is the World Health Organization engaged in bioweapons research?,"(Natural News) In a recent interview with Infowars‘ Owen Shroyer, Dr. Francis Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law, talked about novel coronavirus, the Biosafety Level 4 laboratory (BSL-4) in Wuhan, China, where it appears to have originated, and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) questionable involvement in bioweapons research.

It’s the latter topic that’s of particular interest for this article, as the WHO is supposed to be an agency that responds to global health crises, not creates them. But it would seem as though the WHO not only knew in advance that 2019-nCoV was created in a lab, but may have also been involved in its creation in the first place.

If this is true, it would constitute a serious crime against humanity, not to mention a total violation of the Geneva Convention. But that’s what we’re up against, here, as Boyle warns that the WHO has been knowingly complicit in unleashing what’s shaping up to be one of the worst global pandemics in decades.

“The Chinese government has been lying about it from the get-go, covering it up, just like they did on SARS,” Boyle stated during the interview, which you can watch below and at Brighteon.com. “The WHO is in on it. You can’t believe anything the WHO is telling you because this is a WHO special designated research lab. The WHO is up to its eyeballs in biological warfare research.”

In other words, the BSL-4 lab in Wuhan where many now suspect novel coronavirus originated was actually designated for such purposes by the WHO itself. And what’s worse, there are a number of BSL-4 labs here in America as well, which is why Boyle drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was unanimously approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law by the late President George H.W. Bush.

As for President Trump’s current handling of the crisis, or lack thereof, Boyle blames those surrounding Trump for not giving him the full scoop about what’s going on. In Boyle’s view, there are evil factions here on our soil that, just like in communist China, are trying to cover up the truth about what really happening.

“I don’t believe President Trump is getting proper scientific advice about how dangerous this really is and that it is an offensive biological warfare weapon,” Boyle stated during the interview. “Basically, he has surrounding him all these scientists who have been up to their eyeballs in this dirty biological warfare work here in the United States.”

“So, I have no idea what they’re telling President Trump, but I suspect they’re spinning it to protect their own rear ends here. In my opinion, every BSL-4 laboratory here in America should be shut down immediately.”

Boyle also discussed a report put out by the GreatGameIndia journal that exposes novel coronavirus as a Chinese biowarfare agent, and not some random disease supposedly being spread by snakes and bats.

“On biowarfare programs they want to cover up, they always blame it on bats,” Boyle contends. “You know, bats have been around forever, so give me a break.”

Francis Boyle’s contentions about novel coronavirus being a Chinese bioweapon constitute “synthetic news” in the eyes of Big Tech

You’ll want to watch the entire interview with Boyle because it’s a real eye-opener, and something you won’t find anywhere in the mainstream media. That’s because any information that even remotely suggests foul play with this whole saga has been deemed “synthetic news” by Google, Twitter, Facebook and the rest of Big Tech, along with communist China which wants to be fully in charge of the narrative.

There’s an obvious cover-up going on with this whole thing, which Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, also discussed during a recent episode of The Health Ranger Report, which you can listen to below (you can also access this video directly at Brighteon.com):

Keep in mind that Boyle isn’t the only one talking about this. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas has also publicly warned that the official narrative surrounding coronavirus is questionable, at best. At worst, it’s an absolute farce that’s keeping everyone in the dark about how a viral pandemic has been unleashed not by wildlife but by evil men and women who develop and test biological weapons for a living.

“As one epidemiologist said: ‘That virus went into the seafood market before it came out of the seafood market.’ We still don’t know where it originated,” Sen. Cotton is quoted as saying.

“I would note that Wuhan also has China’s only bio-safety level four super laboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.”

US reports first case of COVID-19 reinfection,"(Natural News) A 25-year old Nevada man is the nation’s first case of COVID-19 reinfection. This makes the U.S. the fourth country to report COVID-19 reinfection. Just last week, the world’s first case of COVID-19 reinfection was reported in Hong Kong, followed by cases in Belgium and the Netherlands. The new case is detailed in an online preprint on the Social Science Research Network. In addition, the study has also been submitted to The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

According to the case, the young adult first tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-April. While he recovered, he got sick again in late May and this time, his illness was more severe. Other cases of reinfection, in comparison, were either milder than the patient’s initial bout or even asymptomatic.

Still, despite what happened to the man in Nevada, it’s too early to draw conclusions on the matter.

“It is important to note, that this is a singular finding,” explained Dr. Mark Pandori, director of the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory and a co-author of the case study. “It does not provide any information to us with regard to the generalizability of this phenomenon.”

Based on genetic sequencing, researchers indicated that the Nevada man’s case is a true reinfection, as he was infected with a slightly different strain of SARS-CoV-2 than his initial infection. It’s still unclear why he was reinfected; a theory that the team is looking at is that the person’s initial exposure to the virus did not give him immunity. (Related: Scientists say coronavirus has higher affinity for human cells than bat cells – does this prove it was laboratory made?)

Reinfection a rare – but real – possibility

Earlier studies on COVID-19 have shown that people generally develop a healthy immune response post-infection. This includes antibodies, which block pathogens from infecting cells, and T cells, immune cells that help wipe out the virus. The body’s immune response also creates “memories” of the virus, protecting the body from a second attack.

This means that people who had a COVID-19 infection are protected from another case for some time. For other coronaviruses, these usually last for less than a year to around three years. Experts, however, are still figuring out how long immunity will last with SARS-CoV-2 until people start getting reinfected. This includes understanding the mechanisms behind a person’s immunity against SARS-CoV-2, as well as measurable levels of antibodies or T cells that signal a person has developed an immunity – better known as correlates of protection.

According to experts, while cases like that of the Nevada man are rare, it still raises the possibility of being infected a second time around.

“The evidence so far suggests that if you’ve been infected and recovered, then you’re protected for some period of time,” added Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. Jha, who wasn’t part of the case study, also noted that researchers like him are also looking for cases of people that have been reinfected by the coronavirus.

Nevada reinfection is unique

It’s worth noting that immunity doesn’t just vanish – it loses its strength over time. According to experts, this means that the body may not be able to defend against the virus, but it may prevent a person from getting really sick. The COVID-19 reinfection in Hong Kong demonstrates what the immune system is supposed to do, they added. The man initially had a mild case of COVID-19, but he was asymptomatic the second time.

“You’d expect the second time around people to have much milder or ideally no symptoms,” said Jha.

But that wasn’t the case with the Nevada reinfection. According to the researchers, the man showed typical symptoms – headache, cough, sore throat, nausea and diarrhea – during his initial bout with COVID-19. His symptoms cleared up after 10 days, and he tested negative for the virus. A month later, however, he reported feeling sick again with the same symptoms – plus dizziness. Unlike his first infection, his symptoms did not clear up. In fact, these became markedly worse, as he needed help breathing after his oxygen levels fell dangerously low. He tested positive again for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

But if the current trend of reinfections means that a person can be reinfected in such a short amount of time, it can spell trouble for vaccine developers, Pandori added. “After one recovers from COVID-19, we still do not know how much immunity is built up, how long it may last, or how well antibodies play a role in protection against a reinfection.”

The U.S. currently has over 6 million COVID-19 cases and more than 183,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

AOC demands coronavirus relief money be used to pay “reparations” to “black” and “brown” people because the disease is racist and bigoted or something,"(Natural News) In keeping with the far-Left Democratic mantra of never letting a good crisis go to waste, freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (DS-N.Y.) is making an odd and inappropriate demand on a chunk of relief money aimed at stemming the financial and economic damage caused by Wuhan coronavirus-related business closures.

Because the coronavirus is ‘racist’ and ‘bigoted’ — or something to that effect — she believes that “black and brown people” ought to get a bigger share of the pie because…”inequality.”

As Paul Joseph Watson of Summit News reported:

[AOC] has called for coronavirus “reparations” for black and brown people, claiming that “environmental racism” is an “underlying health condition.”

Yes, really.

COVID deaths are disproportionately spiking in Black + Brown communities. Why? Because the chronic toll of redlining, environmental racism, wealth gap, etc. ARE underlying health conditions. Inequality is a comorbidity. COVID relief should be drafted with a lens of reparations. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 3, 2020

“COVID deaths are disproportionately spiking in Black + Brown communities,” tweeted the New York socialist. “Why? Because the chronic toll of redlining, environmental racism, wealth gap, etc. ARE underlying health conditions. Inequality is a comorbidity. COVID relief should be drafted with a lens of reparations.”

As usual, this lunatic provided no source data for her accusations, nor any definitions for her wholly fabricated terms and concepts.

Like “environmental racism.” What, exactly, does that mean? How can ‘the environment,’ as most of us understand it, be ‘racist’ or bigoted? Moreover, how does money help alleviate this alleged condition?

But of course, AOC has her sycophantic supporters, and many of them specialize in also making issues of out non-issues by pointing out things that may or may not have anything to do with anything at all.

Yet…they notice such things.

I've also noticed that stores that mostly serve white customers are enforcing social distancing more than those in some black and brown communities. I have no idea why, it was just something I noticed while driving past grocery stores in different areas. — Alexandra MacArthur (@alexgoesthere) April 3, 2020

Great. Now there’s a racist conspiracy among white business owners who ‘enforce social distancing rules’ (as they are being requested to do by the president, his health policy advisers, governors, and mayors)? Who thinks like this?

The political equivalent of a cesspool

Oh, yeah. AOC supporters. Because she thinks like that.

No, wait. It’s white supremacy.

Their bodies also WORK DIFFERENTLY, and we blatantly IGNORE THIS in medicine and don't study the differences and then adjust treatment for. White supremacy pervades EVERYTHING. — Mainely Liberal (@MainelyLiberal) April 3, 2020

Stupidity.

USA Features Media notes further that AOC just isn’t a happy camper these days, even with members of her own party whom she feels are not sufficiently giving away the country’s future economic viability (as if coronavirus hasn’t been destructive enough):

Also, she’s used the outbreak as a platform to push her socialist agenda of universal healthcare, taxpayer-funded free college, instituting what she calls a “living wage,” and guaranteed housing.

On Tuesday, she blasted Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo for suspending mortgage payments but not rent payments during the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, he halted evictions for 90 days, though renters will still be responsible for missed payments, he said, because landlords have bills and payments too.

“We’re kind of creating a class and race issue,” Ocasio-Cortez said on WNYC’s “The Brian Lehrer Show,” Fox News reported Wednesday. “We’re essentially rewarding and offering preferential treatment to landowners and folks who are more wealthy, and we’re not offering that same kind of relief to renters.”

“There’s absolutely … racial and class inequities baked into the crisis,” she said. “If you are able to stay home. You are a privileged person in this moment.”

No, there aren’t.

This nonsense is a figment of a young socialist mind that has been polluted with the political equivalent of a cesspool. Nothing America does, tries to do, has done, or will do will ever suffice or be enough or be worthy of praise by AOC and her ilk.

America sucks, in other words, because it’s always going to be unjust, racist, bigoted, unforgiving and lousy — even when it has been attacked by a Chinese virus.

With these kinds of ‘friends,’ America has no further need of enemies.

This kind of nonsense isn’t helpful. At a time when a lot of Americans are smarting financially — and a lot more will begin to, soon enough — we need leaders who are uniting, not dividing.

Obviously, when it comes to this one, that’s asking too much.

Infected patients develop long-term immunity to coronavirus,"(Natural News) People infected by the coronavirus develop long-term immunity to COVID-19. A new study published August 14 in the journal Cell presented evidence that the immune system is capable of preventing the recurrence of the disease, thanks to specialized immune cells that commit the virus into memory.

Memory T cells are a type of white blood cell trained to recognize specific antigens — molecules unique to a particular virus or bacteria that evoke an immune response. The main function of memory T cells is to protect the body from a previously encountered pathogen, and they do so by triggering a faster and stronger immune response the next time they encounter the same pathogen.

According to a team of researchers from Sweden, Denmark and the U.K., people who have been exposed to the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) develop adaptive immunity to it, regardless of whether their symptoms were mild or severe. Even COVID-19 survivors and patients who tested negative for coronavirus-specific antibodies have this type of immunity, thanks to their body’s resident memory T cells.

The team’s findings of robust memory T cell responses in a mixed pool of COVID-19 patients and survivors in Sweden back these claims.

“SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune protection against COVID-19,” they wrote in their study. (Related: 5 Effective ways to boost immunity during the coronavirus outbreak.)

Virus-specific T cells or antibodies – which one is better?

Antibodies are well-known for their role in immunity. These Y-shaped proteins are produced by white blood cells called B cells to neutralize toxins and block pathogens from infecting cells. Antibodies recognize antigens and bind to them. While they don’t kill viruses or bacteria on their own, antibodies initiate responses that lead to the destruction or removal of pathogens from the body by specialized immune cells.

Owing to their ability to neutralize viral infectivity, scientists have explored the possibility of using SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies produced by COVID-19 survivors to develop a treatment for the disease. The threat of a possible second infection by the coronavirus also forced them to look at whether patients developed long-term immunity with the help of specific antibodies.

Unfortunately, recent investigations all revealed one thing: Coronavirus-specific antibodies don’t stick around for long. They usually disappear two to three months after recovery. According to some experts, these findings highlight the need for strong vaccines, since the immune system cannot provide immunity that lasts long enough to allow people to achieve herd immunity.

But in a new study, European researchers showed why they disagree and reminded people that antibodies are not the only components of the immune system capable of providing pathogen-specific protection. Memory T cells, which can remember previously encountered pathogens, can easily detect SARS-CoV-2 through its signature antigen and initiate a strong immune response in case of a reinfection.

After examining blood samples from patients with mild or severe COVID-19, patients who have recovered from either, and healthy volunteers, the researchers reported that exposure to the coronavirus elicits robust T cell responses. In patients with mild or severe COVID-19, they found that cytotoxic T cells, which are primed to destroy infected cells, were highly activated, while in recovered patients, the less destructive memory T cells were present.

Interestingly, the researchers detected SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in the blood of both current and recovered patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Altogether these findings show that infected people develop adaptive immunity to the virus. Their robust, highly functional memory T cell responses also suggest that they have active virus-specific protection against a possible second infection. And because memory T cells stick around for years, this protection can be expected to last for a long time.

Built-in immunity even without exposure

Two separate studies published in Nature in July also discussed T cell immunity in patients with COVID-19. Two research teams detected functional T cells that reacted to coronavirus proteins in their respective sets of patients. Both teams reported the same interesting finding: They detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells even in uninfected individuals.

In the first study — published two weeks earlier than the second study — researchers found that the T cells in uninfected participants behaved slightly differently from those found in recovering patients. While both sets recognized the coronavirus, the former targeted different regions of the viral protein than the latter. The second study also reported a similar pattern.

According to both teams, this unusual finding can be attributed to cross-reactivity. This phenomenon refers to when T cell receptor proteins recognize more than one antigen. Cross-reactivity in the human immune system has been documented by previous studies, but scientists are still unsure why it happens.

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, they believe that the T cells they found in uninfected individuals were originally activated because of previous exposure to other coronaviruses. And thanks to cross-reactivity, these T cells recognized fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 protein. In the first of the two studies to be published, the researchers noted that the protein regions recognized by T cells in uninfected individuals can also be found in animal betacoronaviruses.

If this hypothesis involving cross-reactivity is confirmed, then this strange phenomenon may help explain why there are mild and severe cases of COVID-19.

White House: 100 million coronavirus vaccines could be ready in October,"(Natural News) As many as 100 million coronavirus vaccines could be ready for distribution as early as October, according to the White House. Speaking to reporters on Sept. 17, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said that the initial tranche of 100 million vaccines would be sent to individuals with the highest risk of contracting the virus. He added that the second tranche of about 200 million could be ready by January next year.

Meadows’ statement follows remarks by both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, both of whom have said that the administration is on track to have 100 million coronavirus vaccines before the year ends.

Scientists are racing to test vaccine candidates, with a number of them currently in phase III — the last testing phase required before approval and distribution. A number of vaccines are already being manufactured through the administration’s Operation Warp Speed program, in case the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves them.

The Trump administration also released a strategy and playbook for distributing the FDA-approved vaccine to all Americans. According to the playbook, the vaccination campaign is to commence gradually in January 2021 or earlier than that period.

Meanwhile, Director Robert Redfield of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasized the necessity of a vaccine during a U.S. Senate hearing. When asked about the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine, Redfield gave an estimate of “[about] late second quarter [or] third quarter [of] 2021.” (Related: COVID-19 vaccine may not be generally available “until next summer”: CDC chief.)

Commenting on Redfield’s answer during the hearing, Meadows said that the CDC director “hasn’t had intimate discussions” on the vaccine production timeline as his office isn’t directly involved with vaccine development.

Democrats accuse Trump of fast-tracking the vaccine

Meanwhile, Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden said that a vaccine “will not be available for most of the population until well into 2021” during a speech. Biden added that the development cycle for vaccines don’t adhere to election cycles and reiterated that their timing, approval and distribution “should never … be distorted by political considerations.”

President Trump announced Operation Warp Speed in May to fast-track the development of a COVID-19 vaccine by early next year. Based on a fact sheet by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Operation Warp Speed brings different federal departments together to produce and deliver 300 million doses of “safe and effective” vaccines – at a fraction of the duration it typically takes to develop a new vaccine.

However, rushing to finish a vaccine comes with corresponding health risks.

In early September, pharmaceutical company Astra Zeneca hit a roadblock in its trials for the coronavirus vaccine after a test subject experienced a “serious adverse reaction.” Almost a fortnight later, another test subject experienced the same reaction from AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine.

The company has remarked that transverse myelitis, an inflammation of the spine, is a “rare” disease and had nothing to do with the coronavirus vaccine trials. AstraZeneca is one of the companies participating in Operation Warp Speed, and it would be too soon to say whether its coronavirus vaccine would see widespread use after these adverse effects emerged.

The U.S. has the highest worldwide COVID-19 caseload at 6.8 million with 200,814 fatalities, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.

How the left is using the coronavirus to make the world a twisted dystopia,"(Natural News) If you were living in a dystopia, how would you even know it?

(Article republished from LifeSiteNews.com)

The current situation certainly raises the question, as we experience unprecedented restrictions on individual freedom adopted in response to the Chinese coronavirus, coupled with left-wing riots that undermine the legitimacy of America’s core institutions. It’s becoming clear that these social changes are dystopian, not merely because they are harmful and coercive, but because they seek to replace the American way of life with a new social order rooted in utopian visions.

In a January 2019 essay on the overuse of the word “dystopia” in American political discourse, Miami University of Ohio professor Ryan J. Barilleaux wrote that the defining features of an actual dystopia are “social regimentation, dehumanization, abuse of technology, state terror, a new class of rulers, propaganda instead of truth, inevitable totalitarianism, and the tragedy of the individual.”

“When combined, these features sketch the map of dystopia,” wrote Barilleaux.

“Dystopia is what results from the attempt to create utopia,” he explained. “Consider the society of Brave New World, which is horrible precisely to the extent that the World State was designed to be exactly as it is.”

This year’s warp-speed cultural transformation has brought about all of Barilleaux’s hallmarks of a dystopia. The utopia today’s bureaucrats and elitists are striving toward is a global, communistic police state. This police state is sold to ordinary people not as that, but as a safe, virus-free society. Who wouldn’t want that?

Its architects admit that they won’t stop at a vaccine. “We will not, we cannot go back to the way things were,” World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said August 21.

Nonsensical “virus prevention” measures — forcing people to wear masks alone outside, curfews suggesting that the virus is more deadly at night than during the day — are priming the public to submit to increasingly arbitrary forms of government control and surveillance.

Social regimentation

The social regimentation of our new COVID world is ritualistic and religious. Hand-washing, staying physically away from others, walking only in certain directions at the grocery store, and not socializing are sacrosanct practices.

Snitch lines, bizarre rules about which doors students can use, all-online classes but no cancelation of room and board fees, “testing pods,” and COVID “symptom-tracker” apps are all part of the American college experience now.

So are “social distancing” rules limiting human contact, dorm visits, and parties. Will this mean the death of hook-up culture? Will “virtual” sex and more pornography simply fill its gap? Or will sexual license trump Wuhan virus prevention measures, just as Antifa and BLM riots have been exempt from the supposedly anti-coronavirus standards now applied to churches?

Dehumanization and the tragedy of the individual

Face masks, now required in public or to enter businesses in many places, are one of the most obvious mechanisms of dehumanization. Other people are now faceless potential virus-carriers to be avoided at all costs.

Enforcing limited or no social gatherings also dehumanizes the population. Humans are social creatures. Can existence be joyful, meaningful, and fulfilling if human contact is as severely limited as it has been ordered to be?

The crushing discouragement of family life is not only dehumanizing, but also one of the coronavirus power-grab’s greatest contributions to the tragedy of the individual.

As Barilleaux explained:

The ultimate result of dystopia can be seen in the tragedy of an individual. In dystopian stories and novels, the [protagonist] (such as John the Savage or Winston Smith) is crushed — or nearly so — as a way to make clear just how brutal the prevailing order is. In the real dystopias of modernity, individuals come to symbolize the oppression of the regime: the survivors of Hitler’s death camps, figures such as Andrei Sakharov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, or Otto Warmbier, the American student who died from mistreatment while in North Korean custody.

Today’s suffering individual is best exemplified by Shelley Luther, the Texas beauty salon–owner arrested and jailed for opening her business. A judge said she could avoid jail time by apologizing for being “selfish” and paying a fine, but she refused to “bend the knee,” as her lawyer put it.

For every fighting Shelley Luther, how many Americans are there who simply gave up their dreams of running a small business because the coronavirus and its accompanying restrictions robbed them of all ambition and hope?

Abuse of technology and state terror

Big tech and liberal establishment media censor any news that counters the narrative that the coronavirus — which the vast, vast majority of healthy people survive — is the most serious disease of the century.

A press conference by the pro-hydroxychloroquine America’s Frontline Doctors group was infamously scrubbed from social media despite its massive support, even from President Trump.

At the beginning of the lockdown, authorities in the United Kingdom used drones to capture footage of and subsequently shame people who were exercising. A “social distancing” robot dog — which looked eerily like a machine from Black Mirror — prowled a Singapore park telling people to stay apart.

In Kentucky, supposedly virus-positive individuals have even been fitted with electronic ankle monitors.

Unmasked Utah kindergarteners now face misdemeanor charges.

Police in Victoria, Australia have been granted authority to enter homes without a warrant to carry out “spot checks.”

The combination of 21st-century technology and petty, power-hungry bureaucrats (as my grandmother astutely put it, “some people like to exercise what little authority they have”) has created a perfect storm. And terror isn’t coming only from the state: tech companies voluntarily pick up the slack for government incompetence.

A new class of rulers

“[D]ystopia empowers a new class of rulers and uses propaganda and state terror to maintain the power of the regime,” wrote Barilleaux. “Dystopian regimes employ propaganda (‘Freedom is Slavery,’ ‘Community, Identity, Stability,’ ‘Workers of the world, unite!’) to mislead the populace and state terror (disappearances, reeducation camps, gulags, the Thought Police, the Firemen of Fahrenheit 451) to enforce conformity.”

Our new class of rulers are “public health experts.” Many of these people say there are an infinite number of genders, men can get pregnant, a human in the womb with a beating heart is just a “clump of cells,” and children should be able to attempt to “change” their sex.

They are now the ones whose interpretations of data and projections (projections being guesses) are infallible. Questioning them is to deny science, a cardinal sin.

Propaganda instead of truth

The coronavirus outbreak has produced a host of creepy “war is peace” phrases such as “staying apart keeps us together” and “social distancing.”

Actually, staying apart…keeps us apart. Staying as far as possible from other people isn’t social…it’s anti-social.

This has never been about a virus

For today’s revolutionaries, this was never about any virus; rather, it is about a crisis that can be used to usher in a new world order, a “new normal,” where human beings live in fear and under constant surveillance by an all-powerful regime.

In this atomized, isolated state, the populace is easier to control, and the supposedly “virus-free” utopia can be brought about.

However, nothing in history is inevitable. Dystopias are created only by and through the consent of those who stand by and say nothing while their liberties are taken. Americans mustn’t give tyrants a single inch. The time to fight is now, before it’s too late.

"Green tea, zinc, and hydroxychloroquine: Coronavirus cure?","(Natural News) The alt-media is all over the coronavirus – hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) scandal, with some news outlets even bravely talking about the importance of supplementing with zinc for maximum immune protection. But there is another healing component that few are mentioning, and it is probably already stocked away in your kitchen pantry.

We are talking about green tea, or more specifically epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol component of green tea that research suggests might be substantially more powerful than HCQ and zinc at protecting against viral infections.

Ionic zinc, as a quick background, helps to modulate both the innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways inside the body to ward off pathogenic invaders, including the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). And HCQ is said to help zinc ions more easily and effectively do their job in supporting healthy immune function.

There has been a whole lot of bickering recently over the alleged benefits of HCQ, with the anti-Trump left insisting that it does not work. Those on the right, primarily, say that HCQ works surprisingly well, and peer-reviewed science would seem to back this.

But the real power is in the zinc which, among its many other functions, acts as a protective nutrient for preserving natural tissue barriers, including in the respiratory epithelium. In essence, zinc helps to block pathogenic entry into the body while optimizing the immune system.

Zinc deficiency, in other words, is a major risk factor for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. We already know that about 16 percent of all deep respiratory infections worldwide are linked to zinc deficiency, and Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection is no exception.

“As a virus, SARS-CoV2 (Wuhan coronavirus) is highly dependent on the metabolism of the host cell,” one paper explains. “Direct antiviral effects of zinc have been demonstrated in various cases … Examples include coronaviridae [i.e. coronaviruses].”

“Zinc supplementation improves the mucociliary clearance, strengthens the integrity of the epithelium, decreases viral replication, preserves antiviral immunity, attenuates the risk of hyper-inflammation, supports anti-oxidative effects and thus reduces lung damage and minimizes secondary infections.”

Drinking green tea and taking zinc is BETTER than taking HCQ

Where HCQ comes into play has to do with its role as a zinc ionophore, meaning HCQ helps to deliver otherwise bio-unavailable zinc across the lipid boundaries of cells. Another drug known as clioquinol is said to be an even more potent zinc ionophore, delivering up to 10 times more zinc into the cells than HCQ.

As for green tea, its natural EGCG content is also a zinc ionophore. Not only that, it is a much more powerful zinc ionophore than HCQ which, it is important to keep in mind, is still a pharmaceutical drug.

While EGCG is only about 60 percent as powerful as clioquinol, it is substantially more powerful than HCQ which, due to political strife, remains largely inaccessible to Americans. Green tea, on the other hand, is widely available without a prescription.

“Fortunately, the main active ingredient in green tea, epigallocatechin gallate (“EGCG”) has been shown by a team of Spanish scientists to be 60% as powerful a zinc ionophore as clioquinol, which is the world’s most powerful zinc ionophore,” reports Zero Hedge.

“Dr. Juan Bautista Fernández Larre – a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology at the Universitat Rovira i Virgili – and his team have published several scientific papers on the topic.”

Another beneficial zinc ionophore in the natural category is quercetin (QCT), which is said to be about 30 percent as effective as clioquinol. This is still more effective than HCQ, though, providing yet another potential option for healing that avoids the political red tape and questionable safety of prescription drugs.

Getting vaccinated for coronavirus could make the pandemic worse,"(Natural News) Until a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine becomes publicly available, some government officials have indicated that they want to keep everything under indefinite lockdown. But a vaccine could end up making the plandemic even worse, according to Anthony Fauci.

In case you missed it, Fauci is on record as having stated in the past that earlier vaccine candidates for other coronaviruses produced a “suboptimal response.” He went on to explain that they actually “enhanced pathogenesis of the disease, which is always worrisome.”

The Citizens’ Council for Health Freedom (CCHF) in Minnesota has issued an urgent plea calling on government officials and health authorities to take note of Fauci’s words in addressing current vaccine policy.

“First, there’s ‘no guarantee’ a COVID-19 vaccine will work and second, it could ‘backfire,’ strengthening the virus,” the group has said, as reported by WND.

It was on May 12 that Fauci warned about “two major unknowns” concerning a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which for all intents and purposes is little more than a mutated cold virus.

“I think we should very carefully listen to Dr. Fauci’s concerns,” says Twila Brase, R.N., president and co-founder of CCHF. “No coronavirus vaccine has been developed despite earlier coronavirus pandemics.”

While it would normally take years for a newly developed vaccine to come to market, President Donald Trump has promised fast-tracked vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) as part of his “Operation Warp Speed” plandemic response.

“The American public should be concerned about the possibility that a COVID-19 vaccine may ‘backfire,'” Brase further warns.

2012 study found that SARS coronavirus vaccines made virus worse in test mice

A case-in-point was the infamous SARS pandemic of 2012. The global spread of this earlier iteration of coronavirus was used as an excuse to try to develop a corresponding vaccine, a project that utterly crashed and burned.

Test mice that were given the experimental jab appeared to develop some antibodies, but they also got sicker than the other mice that were not treated with the vaccine.

“Researchers discovered the mice, who were believed to have developed antibodies, had actually gotten sicker,” CCHF says. “The study concluded the vaccines had made the coronavirus more virulent, and issued ‘caution in proceeding to application of SARS-CoV vaccine in humans.'”

Despite all the vaccinated mice developing antibodies, injection with the vaccine resulted in the occurrence of what is known as Th2-type immunopathology, which suggests hypersensitivity to the components included in the SARS-CoV jab.

In lieu of favorable science, Yale wants to coerce people into getting coronavirus jabs by spreading “shame” and “guilt”

Since there is no evidence whatsoever that any Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine will be safe or effective, the plan, at least at Yale University is simply to “guilt” and “shame” resisters into getting jabbed.

A study conducted by Yale researchers concluded that the best way to enforce compliance is to call those who refuse the vaccine “not brave,” and to further suggest that they are selfish and do not “trust in science.”

In contrast to firefighters, doctors and front-line medical workers, all of whom are “brave,” according to Yale, vaccine resisters are cowards, this negative label representing a tool that the vaccine-pushers hope will compel more people to get vaccinated.

“Despite the danger of the vaccine backfiring, and before any of the vaccine trials have proven a vaccine to be safe and effective, proponents are busy figuring out how to force the public to get vaccinated,” Brase says about this desperate attempt to use character assassination as a tool to force vaccine compliance.

“Proponents want the unvaccinated banned from airplanes, buses, or trains, and want everyone to provide ‘evidence of immunization’ to enter public and private auditoriums and spaces. But Americans should be concerned about these proposals, this vaccine, and those who wish to ‘plunge it into their arm.’ People have no idea what they’re signing up for with this vaccine.”

Sweden Close To Victory Over Coronavirus; Never Had A Lockdown Or Mask Mandate,"As the rest of Europe and the world remains under the grip of draconian rules and the threat of new lockdowns, Sweden, which allowed its citizens to remain free throughout the entire pandemic, has pretty much declared victory over the coronavirus.

The country now has one of the lowest infection rates on the planet, and it’s difficult not to admire how it has handled the past year, with no strict lockdown or compulsory face mask rules. All businesses, schools and public places remained open in Sweden for the duration.

“Sweden has gone from being the country with the most infections in Europe to the safest one,” Sweden’s senior epidemiologist Dr. Anders Tegnell commented to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

“What we see now is that the sustainable policy might be slower in getting results, but it will get results eventually,” Tegnell clarified.

“And then we also hope that the result will be more stable,” he added.

Tegnell previously warned that encouraging people to wear face masks is “very dangerous” because it gives a false sense of security but does not effectively stem the spread of the virus.

“The findings that have been produced through face masks are astonishingly weak, even though so many people around the world wear them,” Tengell has urged.

Last week, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control confirmed Sweden’s drop in infection rate, with only 12 cases per million, compared to 18 in neighbouring Denmark and 14 in nearby Norway.



Graphic: The Sun

At the peak of the Sweden’s outbreak, it was seeing 108 new infections per million people, as it pursued a “herd immunity” strategy.

The figures also show that out of 2500 randomly selected and tested people in Sweden, none tested positive, compared to 0.9 percent positive in April, and 0.3 percent in May.

“We interpret this as meaning there is not currently a widespread infection among people who do not have symptoms,” said Karin Tegmark, deputy head of the Public Health Agency of Sweden.

When compared to the rest of Europe, Sweden’s death rate sits somewhere in the middle. However, officials are confident that playing the long game will see this improve drastically.

WHO Chief Warns Of “Vaccine Nationalism” As 172 Countries Sign Onto Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution Scheme,"World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned Monday that “vaccine nationalism” poses a threat to the globalist effort to administer coronavirus vaccines to the entire world.

“Vaccine nationalism only helps the virus. The success of the COVAX facility hinges not only on countries signing up to it, but also filling key funding gaps,” Ghebreyesus said, likely referring to President Trump and America, during the WHO’s latest coronavirus vaccine briefing.

So far, he said, 172 countries representing 70% of the world population have signed up for the coronavirus vaccine distribution scheme, where 2 billion doses of the vaccine will be distributed across the world by 2021.

“There is light at the end of the tunnel. As I said last week, together we can do it,” Ghebreyesus stated.

WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan also criticized President Trump’s recent effort to authorize emergency use of convalescent plasma treatment for coronavirus patients, saying there’s “very low evidence” that it would be effective.

“The results are not conclusive. The trials have been relatively small and the results in some cases point to some benefit but have not been conclusive. We have been tracking this and do ongoing… reviews to see where the evidence is shifting or pointing at and the moment it is still very low evidence,” she said.

But Swaminathan admitted earlier this year that the WHO doesn’t “really have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries, and this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions because we’re not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask about the deaths that have occurred due to a particular vaccine, and this always gets blown up in the media.”

However, Swaminathan was still quick to claim that the coronavirus vaccine, which is being fast-tracked by many years through safety trials by several countries and agencies, is the only safe bet.

“Generally, to develop a new vaccine for a disease, under normal circumstances, it will take anywhere between five to 10 years. In this case of a pandemic, with the joint efforts by WHO and other agencies, it might take at least one to one-and-a-half years, minimum, as finding a new vaccine involves a testing process,” she told reporters last week.

But don’t worry, this fast-tracked experimental vaccine will be much safer than well-known treatments that have been around for decades.

President Trump withdrew America from the UN-backed WHO in June over its poor response to the coronavirus pandemic and efforts cover up Communist China’s involvement in spreading the virus across the planet.

“China has total control over the World Health Organization despite only paying $40 million per year compared to what the United States has been paying, which is approximately $450 million a year,” the president said.

22 Colorado children die from coronavirus,"At least two youths in Colorado have died after developing a rare coronavirus-linked inflammatory condition known as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), health officials in the state said this week.

A total of seven children in the state have developed the syndrome, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) confirmed to Fox News on Friday. The cases have also been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

No other details on two deaths were revealed, including the children’s ages, with health officials citing privacy concerns.

“To protect family privacy, we cannot share any other details at this time,” CDPHE said in a statement to Fox News.

MIS-C is an inflammatory condition that is similar to Kawasaki disease, which causes swelling in arteries throughout the body. However, the two conditions are not the same, and MIS-C has largely been reported in children who have been infected with or exposed to COVID-19.

MIS-C typically causes inflammation in the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. MIS-C can also cause persistent fever, rashes, vomiting, and diarrhea, among other symptoms, such as a red tongue and eyes.

At least two children in Colorado have died after developing a rare coronavirus-linked inflammatory condition known as multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

At least two children in Colorado have died after developing a rare coronavirus-linked inflammatory condition known as multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

“We still think this is a relatively rare disease,” Dr. Sam Dominguez, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, told The Colorado Sun. “We still are in a learning phase about what this syndrome really is.”

A recent study found that MIS-C is indeed a new condition, with researchers in a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifying the main symptoms and clinical markers.

A recent study funded by the CDC also reaffirmed reports of MIS-C and its relation to COVID-19.

Researchers involved in the study surveilled pediatric health centers across the U.S. from March 15 to May 20. Of 186 MIS-C patients in 26 states, researchers found that 73 percent had been previously healthy, and 70 percent tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes a COVID-19 infection. The median age was 8.3 years, and patients were hospitalized for about a week.

Most patients had a fever lasting four or more days. For a small number of patients, 25 days had passed between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and hospitalization for MIS-C.

“These findings suggest that a substantial proportion of the patients in this series were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least 1 to 2 weeks before the onset of MIS-C,” the study’s authors wrote.",2020-07-24 22:09:40+00:00,
The Dark Side of Onlyfans They Don’t Tell You About [VIDEO],"You may have heard of OnlyFans, the membership app popular among Gen Z which allows fans to pay to see content from their favourite performers. Any influencer can use the app but it’s mainly utilised by people who work in porn. With many of us forced into self-isolation due to coronavirus, OnlyFans has become a lifeline for those working in the adult entertainment industry, with cam girls, adult models and porn creators all generating income by charging their ‘fans’ a fee to unlock their content.

OnlyFans has over 17.5 million users worldwide, and has seen 1.85 million new registrations since 29th February thanks to the pandemic, with performers reporting significant growth in their subscriptions in the last few weeks. While this may be good for the future of the British-based company, a new BBC Three documentary has zeroed in on the effects that selling explicit content can have on performers.



ViralCocaine takes a deep dive into OnlyFans and its part in the adult entertainment industry. We meet 23-year-old Lauren from Northamptonshire, one of OnlyFans’ top creators who brings home a whopping £37,000 a month selling explicit content. There’s also 24-year-old Beth, who earns £3,000 a month by selling naked content.

However, while Lauren and Beth’s incomes look impressive, presenter Ellie Flynn reports that for every ‘success’ story on the app, there are many more which are the opposite. Bespoke and exclusive research commissioned by the BBC for the documentary found that on a single day, a third of Twitter profiles globally advertising ‘nudes4sale’ (or similar) appeared to belong to an underage individual and many of those used OnlyFans to share their content.

Flynn meets Hannah*, a 17-year-old girl from Scotland who has been selling explicit content of herself since she was 16. Hannah initially set up an account on OnlyFans using a fake ID. Her account was then reported for being underage and was kicked off the site, but she managed to set up a new profile and continues selling nudes.

More young women are interviewed, like 20-year-old Sasha*, who earns a few hundred pounds each month on OnlyFans and uses that money to put a roof over her head. At age 15, Sasha sent explicit photos to boys on Snapchat, but things spiralled when one of her photos was leaked. “Unfortunately, my parents kicked me out and they are not ready to deal with how I lead my life.”

She’s still trying to find somewhere to live and is in desperate need of emergency accommodation from the council. But when she applied for it, her request was denied. “I’m not considered a priority and I can appeal it but that’s just going to take longer,” she says, holding back tears.



Using OnlyFans to make money is a financial lifeline for Sasha. In her content, she uses sex toys, collaborates with other performers and has even fielded requests to make videos of herself going to the toilet for £50-£60. “I do most things, I’m just not really into anything that involves extreme bodily fluids. I’ve spoken to customers about [filming toilet-based content] but I’ve never followed through,” she says.

I DO MOST THINGS, I’M JUST NOT REALLY INTO ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES EXTREME BODILY FLUIDS. A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL REQUEST VIDEOS OF YOU GOING TO THE TOILET. I’VE SPOKEN TO CUSTOMERS ABOUT IT BUT I’VE NEVER FOLLOWED THROUGH.

SASHA*

“It’s a very slow month. I’m making an extra £100-£200 a week, which obviously sounds a lot to some people but when you have to start spending that on finding somewhere to sleep and food and transport, you definitely need to get some content out and make some extra money.”



Moving her content from Snapchat to the fee-paying OnlyFans, Sasha admits that it could be very easy to fall into the trap of adult sex work. “It’s a rabbit hole. You can go further and further. Something that could’ve started as innocent fun can turn sour more quickly.”

As it stands, UK law states that you must be over the age of 18 to sell or distribute explicit content. However, there is no legal requirement or regulation to compel OnlyFans to scan content on its app for such material. All legal and potential criminal liability lies with the individual who uploads and/or receives/distributes said content.

Sasha says she receives messages from other underage girls wanting advice on how to create content like hers. But she warns the impact could be detrimental as they don’t see the whole picture. “I’m not going to put a photo of me wearing pyjamas without makeup on OnlyFans as it’s not going to get me anything. So they are only seeing the ‘good’ things.”

Flynn tells Refinery29: “Sasha was young, alone and suffering from serious mental health issues – yet was still left homeless, and to me this suggests there is a greater need for councils to protect vulnerable members of society to prevent more young women ending up feeling desperate.”

She says she is concerned that with more and more young people out of work and struggling to make ends meet, more will turn to sites like OnlyFans out of desperation, instead of choice. “It is so important to remember that while some people will do extremely well on sites like [this], there is absolutely no guarantee of success – and it seems to me the personal cost of selling nudes can at times be high.”",2020-07-19 02:09:45+00:00,
WOMAN INFECTED WITH COVID-19 GIVES BIRTH TO TWINS AND NAMES THEM CORONA AND VIRUS,"A Mexican woman who has contracted the coronavirus has miraculously given birth to twins reports El Heraldo.

Annamaria José Raphael Gonzalez, 34, gave birth to twins while she was infected with the coronavirus at Hospital General La Villa in Mexico City.

Gonzalez gave birth to two healthy babies at approximately 2 am this morning, a girl named Corona José Miguel Gonzalez and a boy named Virus José Miguel Gonzalez.

“I didn’t have any names planned and one doctor suggested I called them Corona and Virus because I was infected with COVID-19 and I thought it was a wonderful idea,” Gonzalez told reporters.

“I told her she should call them Corona and Virus as a joke but it seems she took it seriously,” Doctor Eduardo Castillas said laughingly.

Annamaria Gonzalez had planned to give birth in the United States next week but was forced into labor before she could reach the border.

“I knew I was infected with COVID-19 but I wanted to give my children a chance to have a U.S. citizenship by crossing the border,” she told reporters.

Mysterious new coronavirus outbreak hits China – MILLIONS back in lockdown MUTATING-symptoms don’t show for DAYS more,"Chinese officials have imposed quarantine restrictions on two cities in the province of Jilin located in northeast China. Jilin is part of a wider province located in the Dongbei region – which is home to more than 100 million residents. The threat level in the area has been raised to “high-risk” by health authorities.

Health officials have identified two emergency hospitals to treat the suspected spike in COVID-19 infections.

Around 40,000 residents in the cities of Jilin and Shulan have been tested for coronavirus after officials were alerted to a possible new outbreak. In Jilin, authorities stopped all major transport links to and from neighbouring cities until further notice.

Fresh COVID-19 cases in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang in the north-east of the country are displaying different symptoms, suggesting the disease is changing as it moves across the country once more. Dr Qiu Haibo, who is an expert in critical care medicine at the National Health Commission, said the cluster of cases in the cities – which have a combined population of five million – were proving a cause for concern.

People in the two cities were carrying the virus for longer before becoming symptomatic than cases among the population of Wuhan, to the south, where the disease was first identified towards the end of last year.

Dr Qiu told state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV): “This causes a problem, as they don’t have any symptoms.

“So when they gather with their families they don’t care about this issue and we see family cluster infections.”

In addition, he warned infected patients were taking considerably longer to recover.

In contrast to previous cases, new patients rarely displayed high temperature, and suffered lung damage rather than across, Dr Qiu said.

Intriguingly, he suggested the mutated strain seemed to have been imported from overseas.

He did not specify which country he was referring to – but both cities are close to China’s border with Russia, which now has the second-highest number of cases in the world, 317,554, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center.

They are also close to China’s border with North Korea – although, officially at least, the Hermit State has no cases of COVID-19.

Both Jilin and Shulan, located in the province Jilin, are subject to fresh lockdown restrictions.",2020-05-26 15:40:14+00:00,
More virus outbreaks including “EBOLA” erupt alongside coronavirus worldwide,"It’s a good time to be a virus, it seems. While everyone is likely well aware of the coronavirus pandemic, other viral diseases are also thriving, spreading locally and threatening already overwhelmed healthcare systems.

In Indonesia, dengue—which is spread through mosquitoes—has infected some 40,000 people so far this year, a nearly 16% rise from last year. Compounding the problem, most of Indonesia’s hospitals are now tasked with prioritizing patients with Covid-19, leaving those suffering from the painful and sometimes fatal symptoms of dengue without treatment.

In Latin America it’s even worse. The region saw the highest number of dengue cases in recorded history in 2019. And 2020 is on track to be bad too. Argentina right now has more reported cases of dengue than coronavirus. And experts worry that Brazil is about to become the next epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic just as its own dengue outbreak peaks.



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting large dengue outbreaks in Singapore, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is scrambling to contain a new flare-up of an Ebola outbreak that began in 2018. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a new series of cases there in April. As of May 5, there have been more than 3,500 confirmed or probable cases of Ebola in the region.

Health workers are also racing to vaccinate against yellow fever in Ethiopia, where an outbreak killed four people at the end of April. Both Mexico and Burundi are facing large outbreaks of measles and Saudi Arabia continues to battle an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, commonly known as MERS.

Viral outbreaks are hitting animals around the world, too. India and South Africa are both fighting outbreaks of African Swine Fever, which is highly contagious. In 2018, the virus shot through Asia, killing some 10% of the total pig population in some countries.

In the US, officials confirmed in April that a fatal strain of avian influenza had infected a commercial turkey flock in South Carolina. If it spreads, the disease could be devastating for a poultry industry already struggling with the economic impacts of Covid-19. In 2014 and 2015, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys across 15 states were killed to stop the spread of the virus, and much of the world banned American chicken and turkey products to avoid transmission.",2020-05-11 02:41:55+00:00,
All of These States Listed Are Headed for a “Full Shutdown”,"It was only a short time ago that the entire country was under some form of lockdown to help stop the spread of COVID-19. But as states across the U.S. began reopening—some much earlier and faster than others—new epicenters of the pandemic have emerged, with hotspots spanning east to west. To show where COVID risk level is the highest, researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute (HGHI) created an interactive map. The map gives each state one of four color distinctions to indicate their risk—green (on track for containment), yellow (community spread), orange (accelerated spread), and red (tipping point). According to the HGHI, “once a community reaches the red risk level, stay-at-home orders become necessary again.”

On July 11, Ashish Jha, MD, the director of the HGHI, tweeted that the “data on COVID in our nation is very concerning,” as the red states on the HGHI map posted troubling numbers. Jha stated that he wasn’t sure what would “turn it around” besides a “fully enforced mask order” and the closing of bars, clubs, restaurants, and all but essential retail. According to their numbers, these are the seven states that Jha says are “heading towards full shutdown.” And for more places in danger of sliding into critical territory.



1. Arizona

Arizona has not had a good run in the news lately. According to the HGHI data, the state is seeing nearly 48 new cases per day per 100,000 people. The state is also facing a supremely high positive test rate at about 26 percent, which indicates not enough testing is being down, and a critical shortage of ICU beds, according to Covid Act Now. The dire situation has led Arizona hospitals to institute “crisis standards of care,” which forces doctors to triage patients and decide who will receive full care based on their likelihood of survival.

While Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey did order gyms, bars, movie theaters, and water parks to shutter again for at least 30 days on June 29, Arizona’s numbers are still surging and further lockdown may be necessary. And for more on states that are suffering, check out The 2 States Where Coronavirus Is Spreading Fastest Will Surprise You.

2. Florida

Unfortunately, the news coming out of the Sunshine State has been anything but sunny lately. Besides showing 46 new cases per day per 100,000 people, according to the HGHI data, Florida saw the highest ever single-day of coronavirus cases for any state on July 12. Florida’s 15,299 new positive cases that day surpassed New York’s previous record set in April. Coincidentally, the news came the same weekend Disney World reopened to guests.

A couple of weeks prior, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered bars to stop serving alcohol on site. And while the mayor of Miami-Dade County has rolled back reopening, a further statewide shutdown could be coming.

3. Louisiana

Louisiana is one of the states that saw an early victory against the spread of the virus erased after reopening. The state is seeing about 40 new cases per day per 100,000 people, according to the HGHI data. Covid Act Now scores their infection rate of 1.26 as “high,” and the state saw their new cases double in just a week recently.

Now, a return to lockdown might already be in motion: On July 13, a statewide mandate closing bars and requiring face masks went into effect. And for more states that now require masks, These 4 States Just Made Face Masks Mandatory.

4. South Carolina

Recently, South Carolina was given the grim designation of holding the third highest COVID-19 rate in the entire world when compared with other countries and states. HGHI reported a rate of about 33 new cases per day per 100,000 people in the state, along with a critically high risk of hospital overload and a low number of contact tracers, reports Covid Act Now. Overall, South Carolina has seen over 60,000 total cases and nearly 1,000 deaths, The New York Times reports. Its cases have gone up a staggering 999 percent since reopening.

5. Texas

The Lone Star State may be one of the few places arresting people who refuse to self isolate after testing positive for COVID-19, but Texas’ coronavirus figures right now are still alarming. There are about 31 new cases per day per 100,000 people in the state, according to the HGHI, with a critically high risk of hospital overload and a dangerously low number of contact tracers, according to Covid Act Now. Short of a state shutdown, officials in certain hard-hit counties recently began telling citizens to “shelter in place” again.

Gov. Greg Abbott shut bars back down and scaled back restaurant capacity to 50 percent on June 26 and when numbers still surged, he also issued a statewide mask mandate on July 2. “If we do not all join together and unite in this one cause for a short period of time of adopting masks … it will lead to the necessity of having to close Texas back down,” he recently said. And for more on Texas, check out This Is the “Only Way” to Avoid Another Lockdown, Texas Governor Warns.

6. Georgia

Georgia was one of the quickest states to reopen, but since dropping their stay-at-home orders on April 30, they’ve seen their coronavirus new case numbers pick up. HGHI reports that there are nearly 29 new cases per day per 100,000 people, with a high infection rate and positive test rate that is trending upwards, according to Covid Act Now. That might mean they’re headed for another state shutdown. And for more states on the verge, check out These 10 States’ Coronavirus Outbreaks Are Now “Critical,” Experts Say.



7. Alabama

Alabama has roughly 28 new cases per day per 100,000 people, according to the HGHI data. But a growing shortage of ICU beds, a high infection rate, and a low number of contact tracers has earned Alabama a “critical” ranking from Covid Act Now. Local health officials recently warned that the northern part of the state in particular was on the verge of “going off the cliff” due to surging numbers.

2nd Ebola Virus Outbreak Confirmed in DCR & Makes Covid-19 Look like a Joke,"A second outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has struck Congo, even before an earlier outbreak in a volatile eastern region has formally ended.

The Congolese health ministry said Monday it had identified six cases of the Ebola virus in Equateur Province, a region along the Congo River on the border with the Republic of the Congo. Four people have died.

The Equateur Province was the site of a relatively small Ebola outbreak in 2018, which infected 53 people and killed 29. That outbreak was brought under control when health officials rapidly deployed a vaccine to several towns and villages, including Mbandaka, a trading port on the Congo River.

The new outbreak appears unrelated to another that erupted in North Kivu Province, along Congo’s eastern border with Uganda and Rwanda, in 2018. That incident became the second-worst Ebola outbreak in modern history, fueled by violence and unrest in a war-torn region where about a million people are displaced.

The World Health Organization said the health ministry had identified 3,406 cases, and 2,243 had died.

Days before the health ministry was set to declare the end of the North Kivu outbreak, several new cases were detected in the region. No new cases have appeared for several weeks, and the last patient stricken with the virus has been discharged from the hospital.

The new outbreak adds to an already perilous moment for Congo. The health ministry is already dealing with the world’s largest measles outbreak, and the ministry said Monday it had identified 3,195 confirmed coronavirus cases. Most of the coronavirus cases, 2,896, have hit Kinshasa, one of Africa’s most populous cities.

Onlyfans Boyfriend Makes $9Million from 6 Girlfriends Since Pandemic Started,"“I’m Making More Money then the President, I’m thinking about giving the government a loan since I’m making money faster than they can print it” — Choosy

Since the coronavirus pandemic began close to 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment and are struggling to survive. One man Jay Mendoza aka Choosy the P is living the life most men can only dream about. He’s made over $9 million in only 8 short weeks since the pandemic started with 6 girlfriends on Onlyfans.

“I haven’t left the house in 2 months all I do is get my d*ck sucked, F*ck and order DoorDash, while I record my bitches eat each other out”

Said a jovial enthusiastic Choosy the P when we asked him what his day entails. He started with one Instagram model and she brought a friend and before he knew it he was 9 deep with no sleep.



“You can’t write new a chapter in your life with empty thoughts and a dull pencil” — Choosy

Many woman have signed up on onlyfans but only a small percentage actually make any significant amount of money. We asked Choosy what was his secret and he told us:

We were a little confused so we asked him to elaborate and he simply told us “if they knew better they would do better”.",2020-05-27 03:10:39+00:00,

The coronavirus is spreading faster than ever and people are starting to panic like it’s the end of the world. Trump declared a state of emergency and people are losing their minds.

One group of people that most Americans forgot about are prostitutes. Ever since the birth of the internet and things like onlyfans most prostitutes wouldn’t dare pay a pimp. This corona outbreak has changed everything as now thousands of lost prostitutes are searching for some good ole fashioned Pimpin in their life to make things alright.

“I was solo for years when Craigslist shut down I kept hoeing when BP Shut down I kept on hoeing but this corona shit is teww much like where the f*ck are the tricks?

Onlyfans Biggest Competitor Onlypunks Created By Thugger is on the Rise,"Onlyfans has around 9 million registered users and over 100,000 content creators, who have received over $175 million since the company launched in 2016. Years after tube sites like Pornhub began streaming free videos, OnlyFans is helping to re-monetise adult content.

The platform has a big competitor called onlypunks.com that is doing record breaking numbers since its conception in January of 2020. The company already has 1 million registered users in only a few short months and has grown 300% since the coronavirus pandemic started.

It is exclusively for Gay & Lesbian content creators and they are raking in the big bucks in a major way. One content creator Gump “Twinker put it in my Stinker” Gonzalez spoke with us to tell us about how onlypunks changed his life:

“I was broke homeless and sucking d*ck on megapersonals for a whole year living in the motel 6, but within a month of me signing up with onlypunks I bought my first home, 3 cars and money in my bank account, I love my life and now men pay to see my boyfriend pound this @ss out and I no longer have to f*ck for weed and molly doing $70 specials I’m so grateful for onlypunks” — Twinker

The coronavirus crisis is way worse than anything you could have imagined the end is near!,"It’s deflating, but it would be derelict to ignore: The hope of anything approximating normal in the coming months — and probably well beyond — is gone.

Why it matters: It’s great and normal to cheer for a miracle cure or sudden coronavirus retreat. But the experts who study the virus closest seem unanimous in their verdict that our health, economic and social pain will persist for many months to come.

It’s time to recalibrate expectations based on this stark reality:

Bill Gates warned in a blog post this week: “[I]t is impossible to overstate the pain that people are feeling now and will continue to feel for years to come.”

director of the Centers for Disease Control, told the WashPost he imagines a one-two punch this winter of “the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.” Every big business and school in America is privately planning for the possibility of working and learning at home this fall. Schools have no choice but to contemplate the risks of kids picking up the virus in school, and infecting parents and grandparents at home. CEOs are having the same conversations about the workplace.

The true U.S. unemployment rate is estimated at 20% to 45% — possibly exceeding the Great Depression peak of 25% in 1933.

S&P now says the jobs recovery will take until next year, and we likely won’t get back to pre-coronavirus levels for a couple of years.

We cheer the idea of restaurants reopening — but, according to Bill Gates and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, likely with half as many tables.

Ask yourself this: How many restaurants, which already operate on thin margins, can survive with half the business?

How many restaurants, which already operate on thin margins, can survive with half the business? “The whole business model, the whole point of a restaurant, is to get as many people as possible into the space on a given night,” Edouardo Jordan, owner JuneBaby and other restaurants in Seattle, told the N.Y. Times.

Airlines, if and when they return to the skies, may have to leave middle seats open.

Ask yourself this: Would you travel if the threat of the virus remains?

Would you travel if the threat of the virus remains? If so, ask yourself: Can these airlines, already flirting with bankruptcies, survive with 33% fewer seats to sell?

The big picture: One of the most sobering reads of the past week was a synthesis by the N.Y. Times’ Donald McNeil of his gloomy conversations with 20+ experts about the next year or two:

“[T]he scenario that Mr. Trump has been unrolling at his daily press briefings — that the lockdowns will end soon, that a protective pill is almost at hand, that football stadiums and restaurants will soon be full — is a fantasy, most experts said.”

"Coronavirus Lockdown Is Only the Beginning it Will Last 12 to 24 Months, World Will Never Be the Same","“It’s like a fire… You have to keep suppressing it,” one expert said.

Strips of red tape, six feet apart, line the sidewalk outside the walk-up window at Chocolati Cafe. Business is steady on this sunny Sunday, despite the tables and chairs stacked up inside. Three baristas scramble to keep up with orders from an array of customers that stretches out more than 30 feet.

Geordie Glass has just ordered his eight-ounce latte. He’s on his way to walk a lap of Green Lake across the street. “I do this almost every day now,” Glass, 45, told Viralcocaine. “I’m running out of things to do at home.”

At the lake, a steady stream of walkers, runners, skaters, and bikers share the three-mile path with gaggles of geese. Here, too, most people—if not the congregating geese—are adhering to the international trend toward social distancing.

A reminder is posted by the trail: “Stay 6 feet or at least arm’s length away from others.”

But what was a sort of Northwestern curiosity as recently as a few weeks ago may not only outlast the wishes of GDP-fixated politicians like Donald Trump, but also become a regular—that is, intermittent—fact of American life. Taken together, recent COVID-19 forecasts suggest Americans should be ready not just for a months-long shutdown, but also to potentially return to the practice again.

In other words, some epidemiologists and other scientists closely studying the pandemic increasingly seem to be veering toward a long-term, multilayered approach—including repeated periods of social distancing.

“It’s like a fire. If you don’t completely put it out, it will come back. You have to keep suppressing it,” Michael Osterholm, professor and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told The Daily Beast.

More than 250 million Americans have been ordered to “shelter in place” or stay at home in hopes of quelling COVID-19. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D)—whose initial order in America’s first state with a confirmed case of the disease was set to expire on April 8—said last week that the effort would be extended. He and local authorities have also introduced piecemeal measures: In addition to schools, dine-in restaurants, bars, and other nonessential businesses, closures now include many trailheads, playgrounds, even boat-launch sites.

New data suggest the social-distancing efforts have slightly slowed the rate of increase in new COVID-19 infections across the state—that there’s hope here. “We have to hammer this until we can be assured it will not spring back up,” Inslee said.

But just how hard and how long to hammer remains up for debate. A pair of reports released Monday by the Bellevue-based Institute for Disease Modeling found that social-distancing policies have curtailed the movement of people around King County, Washington, and significantly slowed the spread of COVID-19. Still, the models suggest “evidence of fluctuating adherence” leaves the county in a “precarious position,” according to its authors.

That data followed analyses released Thursday by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine. As of Tuesday, it forecast U.S. deaths to total more than 83,000 by July, even with social-distancing measures in place. “It’s working and it will work even better if we do much more of it,” Ali Mokdad, a scientist at IHME and contributor to the analyses, told The Daily Beast. “In many places, even in Seattle, people are not 100 percent adherent to staying at home. We have to stay vigilant at least through mid-May.”

Even that may not be enough. Still more research released last week by a Harvard team suggested a successful battle against COVID-19 was also unlikely to be waged in a single shot.

The authors of the paper, a preprint posted at medrxiv.org that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed, determined that one long period of stringent social distancing could potentially backfire in a greater resurgence of infections come fall and winter, unless other interventions are put in place. The finding was consistent with the course of the 1918 influenza pandemic, during which cities that had low peaks during the first wave of infections—thanks in large part to social-distancing measures—were at a greater risk of a higher second wave after those interventions were lifted.

Models detailed in the Harvard paper point to cycled periods of social distancing as a potentially better way to minimize the overall toll on the population, achieve greater “herd immunity,” and take pressure off already-strapped intensive-care units (ICUs).

The approach may also provide a welcome summer respite for Seattleites, New Yorkers, and other Americans who are going stir crazy—or facing economic hardship, large or small. “Any kind of reprieve would be welcome,” said Glass, who works as a physician assistant in radiology—now 30 hours a week due to reductions in elective surgeries in response to the pandemic. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs entirely, and millions more are expected to in the coming days.

Rather than fully releasing the brakes, according to the Harvard models, officials may eventually want to start pumping them—strategically letting up on social distancing as ICU beds empty, and then re-enacting measures as beds fill back up. The idea, in part, would be to steadily build up population immunity while not overwhelming critical-care capacity.

“What we find is that those social-distancing efforts that are relatively successful in flattening the curve end up pushing the peak out,” Yonatan Grad, an infectious-disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of the paper, told The Daily Beast. “If there is seasonality, and if the peak gets pushed into the fall, we will see an even higher peak.”",2020-04-25 21:29:14+00:00,
"Hantavirus, a New Threat? Man in China Tests Positive and Dies of Virus","While the world is still dealing with the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a man in China has just recently reportedly died of another virus, called Hantavirus. Along with the man, there were 32 other people on the bus he was on that tested positive for the virus as well, which is quite rare because the virus does not usually pass from human to human.

Hantavirus

The Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome or HPV has a 36% fatality rate that is an alarming number for an otherwise small virus.

What is Hantavirus?

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have defined this virus as belonging to the family of Hantavirus pathogens that spreads mainly through rodents. According to the CDC, “Infection with any hantavirus can produce hantavirus disease in people,”

The agency explains that every single strain of Hantavirus is linked with a specific rodent and that this virus is passed through airborne transmission when the particles that contain the virus from the animal’s feces, urine, or even saliva travel in the air and infect an individual.

The infection from this virus is quite similar to other viruses as a person could get this by touching their mouths or nose after being in contact with contaminated surfaces with urine, saliva, or feces from the host. Eating contaminated food could also be another way this virus travels.

The Hantavirus is more likely to be caught in rural areas such as forests, farms, or even fields where the rodent carriers are most likely to be found.

The ‘New World’ Hantavirus versus the ‘Old World’ Hantavirus

People within the Americas infected with the ‘New World’ Hantavirus can possibly develop what is more popularly known as the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome or HPV. The ‘Old World’ Hantavirus, on the other hand, can be found in either Asia or Europe, which can trigger Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome or otherwise known as HFRS.

The CDC has stated that the Hantavirus within the U.S. cannot pass from person to person, while only rare cases of human to human transition have been found in Chile and Argentina in people who had quite a close contact with those positive of the Andres virus.

The symptoms of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome or HPS include fever, fatigue, and muscle aches, especially in thighs, hips, the back, and also the shoulders. People who are infected may get headaches, chills, vomit, and even experience diarrhea and stomach pain.

After four to ten days, the person might then experience shortness of breath, cough, and certain fluids that may even fill their lungs.

The details of the man were withheld

Whether or not the man experienced certain HPV symptoms or HFRS symptoms is unclear, but the fact that the virus was able to transfer through human to human contact is quite alarming and is a rare case as reported by the CDC.

The name and other personal details of the victim are still being withheld.",2020-03-24 20:17:16+00:00,
President Trump Likely Has Coronavirus – Faces Hospitalization!,"There’s a new report from Slate magazine, that claims that President Donald Trump is “likely” to have contracted the coronavirus.

This is bad news for Trump, because ViralCocaine News has learned he’s at high risk for developing serious complications if he’s contracted the virus. Trump has a number of risk factors, which will all but guarantee that the virus will be devastating for the president.

First off, he’s obese. According to researchers in China, obese patients are at high risk for developing complications with the virus. Trump weighs more than 320 pounds and is 5’10. According to the CDC calculator, he is 50% body fat and considered “severely obese.”

Second, the president is 72 years old. Doctors say that the elderly – defined as those over 70 – are at a much higher risk of death or becoming seriously ill.

Third, he’s a man. The disease is a lot more severe in men than in women. Researchers don’t know why, but the epidemiological reports are clear – men face more complications than women.

Finally, the president has serious heart disease. The last publicly available cardio calcium report of Trump showed that he had extensive heart disease. So much so, that he now takes daily medication to keep it at bay.

So what are his chances of death or serious outcome for the President – VERY high. Some doctors on social media estimate that if the President did contract the disease there was a 50% chance or more of a serious complication that required hospitalization.

Here’s the Slate article discussing why they believe Trump has contracted the coronavirus.

Coronavirus Has 2 Strains Type S Strains Spread Disease Without Them Even Knowing Plus More on the Way,"The deadly coronavirus now confirmed to have two strains which would make it harder for medical experts to contain the spread and find the cure. The virus is evolving and experts say it’s a normal occurrence that viruses’ do when transferring from animal to humans.

70 percent of the infected have caught the more aggressive and communicable strain which quickly spreads to one host to another as the studies have shown.

Type L and Type S Strains

Type L strains that make up for 70 percent of the infected patients are the most lethal, aggressive and contagious types. If you have this strain you will be highly contagious to others and the symptoms will immediately show and medical assistance is required ASAP.

Type S strains that make up the remaining 30% of the infected patients are similar to a slow build-up. This means that it will take more time for the symptoms to show and will less likely be detected even by devices built to detect and deter the spread of the deadly virus.

Possible Reason as to the Rapid Spread of the Virus

Type L strains are becoming less prevalent now and seem to be waining off compared to its sister strain due to “human intervention”, it is safe to say that the human intervention is quickly isolating, treating and warding off the infected which deterred the spread of the coronavirus Type L strain.

If Type S infected to take a longer time to show symptoms but are still contagious than it is safe to say that they are the ones spreading the sickness without the health authorities knowing it as well due to the discreetness of the disease. Type S infected end up infecting more and more people until they too show signs of having the virus and thus transported to quarantine or hospitals for treatment.

The problem now is with the Type S infected, how many people have they came across and have had physical contact or indirect contact with before they were diagnosed. That question alone is disturbingly high enough for you to even take a guess.

Two Strains Confirmed, Possible More on The Way

As the research team only were able to study 103 samples, there are still any more combinations that can lead to more breakthroughs to help the fight of the sickness, worst is they will find out more strains of the virus since it is still evolving right now and shows no sign of stopping regardless of the full force of the medical professionals and the full weight of multinational governments resources.

The Study and The Lead Scientists Discoveries

The team led by Professor Jian Lu and Dr Jie Cui, said in their research paper: ‘Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020.

‘Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly.

‘On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure.’

Coronavirus: Symptoms & Natural Solutions,"The coronavirus is all over the news and social media. It seems like it’s one of the top things people are talking and feeling concerned about. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronaviruses that first started in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It causes fever, coughs, shortness of breath, and upper-respiratory symptoms. Though the majority of the cases are still in China, the virus is spreading around the world and we may be facing a pandemic soon.

But what is the coronavirus anyways? Is it really that dangerous to call for panic? What if the coronavirus starts spreading in the United States? What can you do to protect yourself from the coronavirus? So many good questions – I aim to address everything today.

In this article, you will learn what the coronavirus is, how it spreads, what are its symptoms, and who is at risk of the infection. You will learn about some major lifestyle factors that can cripple your immune system and put you at greater risk of any virus or respiratory infection. I will also share some natural solutions that can help to prevent viruses, respiratory infections, and illness this season and help you recover quickly if you do get sick.

What Is the Coronavirus Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large group of viruses. Different strains may cause different illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV, or SARS) or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV, or MERS). Coronaviruses tend to be zoonotic viruses, which means that they can be transmitted between people and animals. For example, SARS was transmitted from civet cats to humans, whereas the MERS originally spread from camels to humans. There are various strains of coronaviruses that are circulating between animals but have not infected humans so far. If you open the news and read about the coronavirus, they are referring to the novel coronavirus (nCoV) or Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new strain of coronaviruses that haven’t been previously seen in humans and has been spreading since late 2019. In this article, I will specifically be covering the COVID-19 and will simply to this strain as ‘coronavirus’ or ‘coronavirus infection’. The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak first started in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While we know that the infection spread from animals, it is not yet clear which animal it has come from. It is a strain of coronavirus that we have not encountered before and it’s different from other strains, including the previously seen SARS or MERS. Symptoms are similar to the flu and the common cold, however, may become severe and lead to complications in those with chronic health issues or in older people. The mortality rate is at 2 percent in Hubei providence in China where the outbreak started and less elsewhere. This is much better than SARS, which had an over 10 percent mortality rate or MERS which killed about 35 percent of those infected.

Coronavirus in the United States

While most cases are located in China, the virus is spreading, which over 300 new cases recently appearing in Northern-Italy. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern, however, not yet declared a pandemic, which is a term referring to an epidemic of disease that has spread worldwide.

Though the United States has only seen 14 confirmed cases, several cities, including San Francisco, declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus to allow hospitals, healthcare professionals, schools, and businesses to prepare. The aim is to help prevention, treatment, and for scientists to find effective vaccines or antiviral medications. However, personal responsibility is also critical, this is why I will go over some natural strategies to boost your immune health later in this article (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).",2020-03-05 04:35:58+00:00,
San Diego lab discovered a coronavirus vaccine in 3 hours but testing it will take months,"Researchers at a San Diego lab say it took them just three hours to come up with an experimental vaccine for the coronavirus — a potential weapon against the illness which has infected tens of thousands of people worldwide.

Inovio Pharmaceuticals is now scrambling to test the vaccine, first in animals and then in people, and if it succeeds they hope to get it to the public as soon as possible, CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB-TV reports.

Chinese scientists released the genetic sequence for the coronavirus on January 9, and researchers at Inovio and other labs around the world immediately got to work.

“We have an algorithm which we designed, and we put the DNA sequence into our algorithm and came up with the vaccine in that short amount of time,” Dr. Trevor Smith, Inovio’s director of research and development, told KFMB.

“It’s something we are trained to do, and the infrastructure is here and the expertise is in house,” Smith said. The company has also worked on vaccines for Zika virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola.

Scientists hope the vaccine will work like a piece of biological software, according to KFMB — giving the human body instructions to launch a targeted attack in the form of T-cells and antibodies against the virus.

“I think it’s every promising, and Inovio has very advanced technology that they’re using with making a DNA vaccine, which is different than our traditional vaccines,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told CBS News.

So far, KFMB reports Inovio’s coronavirus vaccine has been tested on mice and guinea pigs. A clinical trial in humans could come next, perhaps by early this summer — which the company describes as record time. The scientists say they feel a sense of urgency to get an effective vaccine to the public. But even if all the testing proves successful, it would still take time to meet federal regulatory requirements and gear up for manufacturing.

The lead researcher of the company is at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Sweden, working on a plan of attack against coronavirus.

Previously thought that you will need to have direct contact or contact transmission is now confirmed that it can be caught by just being near an individual who is infected. Tech giants are pulling out from the MWC 2020 that is worrying this year’s lineup.

The Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau deputy head stated over the weekend during the Saturday press briefing that “Aerosol transmission refers to the mixing of the virus with droplets in the air to form aerosols, which causes infection after inhalation, according to medical experts,”

“As such, we have called on the public to raise their awareness of the prevention and control of the disease caused by family gatherings.”

Direct transmission: breathing in the air close to an infected patient who sneezes or coughs, and

Contact transmission: when a person touches an object tainted with the virus before infecting themselves by touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.

Grim News for MWC

The Mobile World Congress(MWC) is the largest mobile tech show there is. Companies big and small use that even as a platform to showcase what they have in-store for potential customers as well as create a buzz in the tech world. Sadly, Amazon, LG, Ericson, Ericsson, and potentially more will not be attending this year’s event in Barcelona, Spain.

As more and more major investors pull out of the event, management has decided to put stringent rules and health safety measures to encourage people to come. Despite the efforts, it seems that MWC 2020, for now, will not be as grand as people who had hoped for. Regardless, it will still push through as there is no news or press release indicating otherwise.

nCov update around the world:

The death toll from the virus in the globe as of the time of this writing is 910. Officially making it more deadly than the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS that wreaked panic and massive outcry.

China’s National Health has already confirmed new cases of over 3000 and almost about 100 deaths already in their care. The infection rate has drastically scaled up, which is causing concerns, and governments are doing what they can to control the spread and prevent mass hysteria.

Total of infected people is about 40,000 already, and the cure is still not a viable option.

The main goal for the MWC 2020 right now is to keep as many investors as possible since it’s always been a staple of companies showing their innovations and compete with the best of the best on a world stage setting. The spread of the nCov virus that really can be fatal is going to be a hindrance, to say the least for people to go out and actually go to any events. Some governments around the world are starting to postpone public events due to this news of the virus being airborne.

Ms. Harwood is one of the top earners on OnlyFans, where subscribers — mostly male; straight, gay and beyond — pay models and social media influencers a fee, generally $5 to $20 a month, to view a feed of imagery too racy for Instagram. With that access, subscribers can also direct message and “tip” to get pictures or videos created on demand, according to their sexual tastes.

Models who join the site often presume that their subscribers will increase in number if they post more often and make the content more explicit. The “more often” part is true. The “more explicit” part is not.

At a time when anyone with a smartphone or small studio can become his or her own pornographer, and content is often free, the hottest site in the adult entertainment industry is dominated by providers who show fewer sex acts and charge increasing fees depending on how creative the requests get.

That’s the first paradox at the center of the OnlyFans phenomenon.

Jem Wolfie and Matthew Camp, Businesspeople

The most popular OnlyFans personality is Jem Wolfie, of Perth, Australia.

She can’t help but laugh when people call her a “fitness model.” As she noted in an interview, “70 percent of my fans are men.” So the bulk of them aren’t looking for exercise tips, although she may provide them, for an added fee (along with healthy recipes — she used to be a chef).

According to OnlyFans, she has 10,000 subscribers who pay $10 a month for access to a feed in which she shows off her Kardashianesque proportions, squatting in really tight leggings and squeezing her breasts together, strategically covering her nipples. “I’m a thick girl,” she said matter-of-factly.

It doesn’t go much further than that.

“Basically, OnlyFans is online go-go dancing,” said Matthew Camp, a 34-year-old model on the men’s side who broke into the business a decade ago writhing on platforms around downtown Manhattan for the party promoter Susanne Bartsch.

If the four main quadrants of the gay approval matrix were daddy, twink, bear and boy next door, he seemed to sit smack in the center, not falling neatly into any of those categories but appealing to the potential audiences for each.

With a G-string and a strobe light, he could make as much as $1,000 on a good night. Porn studios like Lucas Entertainment began calling.

Mr. Camp was intrigued. “Having sex for money is appealing,” he said. But $1,000 seemed low for something that would sit on the internet and brand him for life as a porn star.

So he turned them down and instead used a PG-13 feed on Instagram to build a following of more than half a million. About a year ago, as the club scene continued its slow death, he moved to Hudson, N.Y., and signed up for OnlyFans.

Weeks often went by without him posting a single picture or video. He didn’t show a full penetrative sex clip for the first nine months, yet he still regularly took home more than $10,000 a month.

“Tumblr was filled with the most extreme sexual experiences you could see,” he said. “And I think a lot of people were turned off by that. It’s not what they’re looking for. They want more intimate experiences. They want a boyfriend experience. They want to fantasize about someone that they want to have sex with and not feel disgusted by it.”

How the Internet Destabilized Pornography

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, dreamers in the porn industry, centered in the San Fernando Valley of California, openly described their multi-million-dollar futures in the business. There was actually a history of this happening, at least for a small number of models signed to lucrative long-term contracts with studios like Vivid and Wicked.

They could make north of $5,000 a scene and shoot a couple of those each week, according to Brian Gross, a well-known industry publicist. That income could be supplemented with five-figure sums doing nightclub appearances around the country on the weekends, he said.

Jenna Jameson — the Julia Roberts of straight porn — even parlayed her notoriety into a memoir released by HarperCollins, “How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale,” which was a New York Times best seller. The title turned out to be eerily prescient. As its publisher, Judith Regan, pointed out: “Porn went the way of all media.” It turns out, everyone could do it.

Except that because porn was an industry of people already living on the margins of society, the effects for the performers were in many ways worse.

The primary culprits were so-called tube sites: YouTube-like platforms that aggregated stolen pornographic content, disseminated it for free and sucked up revenue from banner and video ads.

Jem WolfieLauren Fleishman for The New York Times

Since porn studios did not have the capital or political connections to sue their most threatening adversaries out of business (as the record industry did), rates for scene work dropped. Fewer scenes were shot overall. Eventually, the studios began selling themselves to the tube sites at fire-sale prices.

It was as if the entire music business had been subsumed by Napster.

By 2015, a handful of companies were able to exert monopolistic control over the industry. MindGeek is the biggest player of all. The crown jewel of its empire is Pornhub (perhaps the most popular tube site in the world), which is supplied with content from numerous in-house production companies of the straight (Brazzers.com, Reality Kings) and gay varieties (SeanCody, Men.com).

MindGeek knows all about porn habits by doing comprehensive data analysis. It has shown less of an affinity for the product or the people who appear in it.

The MindGeek website makes no reference to the fact that the overwhelming majority of its customers are consumers of hard-core pornography.

The technocrats who built the company got rich. Many of the performers who helped enable their success became prostitutes, offering their services on websites like RentMen.com and The Erotic Review when scene work ceased to be a viable way to make a living.

It’s a fitting but unfortunate parable in an era of rampant economic inequality.

“If you have a known name, it’s much easier to market your services,” said Dirk Caber, a porn star who has filmed close to 40 scenes for MindGeek’s most popular gay site, Men.com, since 2013. Most of his income comes from his work as an escort, because this scene work pays so little.

“The whole industry did a 180,” Mr. Gross said. “When I started, there were actually websites that would out famous porn stars if they escorted, because it was shocking, for lack of a better word. Now, all talent is looked at as if they are escorts, and those who aren’t have to come out and say so.”

Your ‘Online Girlfriend’

One alternative to escorting is webcamming. In England, there are even TV stations, like Playboy and Babestation, on which models talk live with thousands of customers and earn several hundred dollars a day.

That’s what Ms. Harwood did before OnlyFans came along.

She grew up in Wales, with a mother who stocked supermarket shelves and a father who was a factory worker.

It was a “typical working-class” household, she said recently, while on a vacation in New York that included a trip to the 9/11 memorial and the taking of many hotel room selfies.

As a little girl, Ms. Harwood was a relentless attention seeker, the sort who appeared in school plays, competed in beauty pageants and studied dance. She also had reservoirs of empathy that would serve her well later in life.

She could spot pain in others and find ways to make them feel better. She also was capable of identifying her limitations and finding ways to chart new paths for herself. “I was raised well,” she said.

She studied dance at Laine Theatre Arts, a prestigious drama and dance college near London. Then, “I went to audition after audition,” she said. “Eventually, I realized I wasn’t good enough. And it was quite hard to accept at first.”

Around 2005, Ms. Harwood posed topless on Page 3 of The Daily Sport, a second-tier British newspaper that she said “was popular with day laborers and construction workers.”

This apparently included the guys her father worked with.

One morning, he went into work and saw the picture of his daughter plastered to his locker.

On her face, his colleagues had drawn his mustache and glasses. That’s how he found out she was modeling nude. That’s why he warned her about being disowned.

Ms. Harwood felt terrible. Although she likes taking off her clothes for other people, she seems driven less by the desire to transgress than the desire to please. If she were reincarnated as a Disney character, she’d be Jessica Rabbit, not Miss Piggy.

But it wasn’t like her father had the money to support her. His warning was sort of an empty threat. So she kept going, with appearances in Playboy and British so-called laddie magazines.",2020-04-11 17:51:19+00:00,
Lifesaving’ lupus drug in short supply after Trump claims it’s a possible coronavirus cure,"For nearly 30 years, Bonnie Lieberman has relied on a drug called Plaquenil to prevent a flare-up of symptoms associated with lupus: rashes, debilitating fatigue, “swollen, hot, painful joints.”

“This drug is lifesaving for me because it helps me function,” she said.

But when Lieberman, a preschool teacher from California, called her pharmacy Friday to check whether her new prescription was available, she got a startling reply.

“I physically don’t have any medication,” Lieberman, 46, said she was told. “It’s back-ordered everywhere.”

Lieberman didn’t have to be told why. She knew that President Donald Trump had touted the drug, known by its generic name, hydroxychloroquine, as a possible treatment for the coronavirus the day before.

Clinical tests are only just beginning, and infectious disease experts say it’s too soon to reach a conclusion. Still, the publicity surrounding hydroxychloroquine, which began well before Trump’s remarks, has fueled shortages across the country, NBC News found.

“To affect lupus patients this way is irresponsible and dangerous,” said Lieberman, a mother of two from Sunnyvale.

“I hope they find something that helps people,” she added, “but it’s more that it’s an unfounded thing at this point.”

Hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial medication, has long been used by people who suffer from lupus. The autoimmune disease afflicts about 1.5 million Americans, predominantly women and African Americans.",2020-03-24 01:42:11+00:00,
President bans sex for the next 6months to prevent coronavirus spread,"The Kenyan government has told members of the public to avoid unnecessary sex and have at least two beds in one household.

The government also discouraged any close contact of people with their partners saying that will increase the chance of spreading coronavirus.

Kenya has confirmed three more coronavirus cases, meaning the country now has seven patients with Covid 19.

Health Cabinet secretary Mutahi Kagwe on Wednesday confirmed that three more patients had tested positive for the virus.

Two of the cases were a couple that travelled from Madrid, Spain on March 4 through Dubai arriving in Kenya on March 5.

The tired case is a Burundian national who travelled from Dubai, UAE, to Kenya. He arrived on March 17 and was picked up by a surveillance team, Mr Kagwe said.

We are tracing persons who may have been in contact with the patients” he said.

The tested were done by the National Influenza Centre and the Kenya Medical Research Institute.

Eighteen patients are currently admitted at Mbagathi. Of these, the CS said seven have been screened and are negative. Samples of 11 others are still being processed.

The Kenya government is now appealing to Kenyans to report anyone who is not self-quarantining.

“Any Kenyans travelling into the country must sign a legal form to assure the gov’t that you will be self-quarantine,” he said.

Mr Kagwe also stressed the importance of strict hygiene in curbing the spread of the pandemic.

“Washing hands and social distancing is the key reasons Chinese cases are coming down.”",2020-03-21 22:06:07+00:00,
Rabbi: Coronavirus outbreak is divine punishment for gay pride parades,"Meir Mazuz claims Arab states spared, because they ‘don’t have this evil inclination’; modern Orthodox group blasts him for ‘inciting against the LGBT community’

An Orthodox Israeli rabbi has claimed the spread of the deadly coronavirus in Israel and around the world is divine retribution for gay pride parades.

The remarks by Rabbi Meir Mazuz, reported by the Israel Hayom daily on Sunday, drew condemnation from rights groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, which urged him to apologize.

An influential Sephardic rabbi, Mazuz is the former spiritual leader of the defunct ultra-nationalist and homophobic Yachad party, and is head of the Kiseh Rahamim yeshiva in Bnei Brak.

On Saturday night he gave a talk at the yeshiva, during which, according to the report, he said a pride parade is “a parade against nature, and when someone goes against nature, the one who created nature takes revenge on him.”

Mazuz said that countries all over the world are being called to account because of their gay pride events, “except for the Arab countries that don’t have this evil inclination.” That was why, he claimed — falsely suggesting there has only been one case of infection in the Arab world — they have not seen a spread of coronavirus.

The outbreak in Iran, one of the most serious in any country, he explained as being due to the wicked ways of Iranians and “their hatred of Israel.”

According to the newspaper, Mazuz had earlier claimed Israel would be protected from the coronavirus.

“It is regrettable that in times like these when the whole world comes together to eradicate coronavirus, Rabbi Mazuz finds it appropriate to blame the virus’s outbreak on the LGBTQ community. We harshly condemn his statements and urge him to apologize,” the ADL’s Israel branch said in a statement.

The modern Orthodox Ne’emanei Torah Va’Avodah group also condemned Mazuz’s remarks.

“Using this time of need to incite against the LGBT community is unacceptable. Trying to get people to return to religion cannot come at the price of harming others,” it said in a statement.

Israel has thus far had 39 cases of coronavirus, including 14 new cases announced on Sunday night, but no deaths.

Mazuz is no stranger to controversy or hateful rhetoric. In November 2015 he claimed gay pride parades and other forms of “sinful behavior” were the reason terrorists murdered Eitam and Naama Henkin on October 1, 2015.

At a memorial event for the Henkins, Mazuz said that their shooting death at the hands of Palestinian terrorists had been a form of divine retribution.

In 2016 Mazuz attributed the collapse of a Tel Aviv parking garage that killed six people and an explosion that destroyed the Amos-6 satellite to Shabbat desecration.

Israel has two major gay pride parades each year, one in Tel Aviv and another in the capital, Jerusalem, which is billed as promoting tolerance.",2020-03-20 04:35:16+00:00,
Barber Dies From Coronavirus After Continuing To Cut Hair During Pandemic,"Damn: Barber Dies from COVID-19 After Taking House Calls

Y’all, please stay home. A Mississippi barber has died from the coronavirus after his family says he continued to cut customers hair during the pandemic. Black people are dying at a disproportionate rate from COVID-19 in several states across the country, especially the south.



Eugene Thompson tested positive on March 22, and felt symptoms as early as March 17. However, it appeared that he was still accepting clients at his shop as well around that time, social media posts show. It also appears he was at a barber competition on March 15th.

Patrons of strip clubs are encouraged to check themselves into a health clinic to get screened. The CDC reports that strip clubs are breeding grounds for coronavirus due to all of the flesh, sweat, booty grease and silicone running rampant in the clubs.

NYC Man Drops Dead In Middle Of Street – Suspected Coronavirus! [VIDEO],"An Asian man wearing a surgical mask passed out yesterday in the middle of a crowded street in Queens. The man was rushed to the hospital, where according to social media reports, he is believed to have died.

The man’s cause of death has not yet been determined, but plenty of people suspect that he may have died of the coronavirus.



The incident occurred in Flushing Queens, an area of the city filled with Chinese immigrants.According to reports, a man was walking down the street, when he was suddenly overcome with a bought of coughing. He collapsed onto the floor, and after a few seconds, he stopped moving.

As the video shows, officers quickly arrived on the scene, but seemed unwilling to physically assist the man, perhaps out of fear.

Coronavirus lockdown could last 10-12 WEEKS: Treasury Secretary will pump $1TRILLION into economy and give families $3K each,"The lockdown affecting 80 million people – nearly one in four of the American population – to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus is likely to last 10 to 12 weeks, or until early June, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said.

Americans are adapting to the biggest change in daily life since World War Two with schools closed, sports canceled and economic upheaval as job losses mount with the shuttering of businesses across many industries.

Hospitals are scrambling for protective equipment for healthcare workers and ventilators as they brace for a wave of patients who will need help breathing. U.S. cases climbed to over 25,000 on Sunday morning and at least 325 people have died, with about half the cases in New York state, according to a Reuters tally.

The virus has killed over 13,000 globally and infected more than 300,000, prompting the likes of California, New York, Illinois and Texas to close non-essential business and ban large gatherings.

Asked how long state-wide stay at home orders could last, Mncuhin said on Fox News Sunday ‘we’re looking at a 10 to 12-week’ scenario’.

Lawmakers in Washington are nearing a deal that could pump a record $1 trillion into the economy to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that he hopes Congress will vote on the bill on Monday. Proposed payments to an average family of four would be $3,000 and would only be one-time for now, he said.

Mnuchin also said the additional liquidity measures for the Federal Reserve aims to help a broad base of U.S. businesses get through next 90 to 120 days.

Questioned about the time it took the US to react to the virus, Mnuchin defended the government’s actions.

‘The intelligence community was giving the White House warnings back in January that the situation coming out of China was very, very serious and would likely end up in a pandemic,’ guest host John Roberts said.

‘Were you ever warned that something like this was coming down pipe because the initial White House reaction appeared to be, “Oh, don’t worry. It’s over there in China.” I was told, why do we need to respond robustly because there’s only 16 cases here.

‘Were you ever warned early on by the intelligence community that this was coming?’

‘You know, I want to be careful talking about specific intelligence. But let me be clear — and this is not just in the U.S., this is around the world. Nobody expected this to take off at the rate it did.’

He added: ‘The situation has changed very quickly and the president has responded to that.’

Time periods for atate-wide shutdowns are indefinite.

But Mnuchin shared lockdown plan details with Roberts when asked whether the time frame was more like six to eight weeks.

‘Well first of all I hope that this gets passed soon as we need the money now,’ Mnuchin began. ‘ I would say that we’re looking at this anywhere from a 10 to 12-week scenario. But again, this situation is moving quickly.’

He added: ‘We need to get the money into the economy now, if we do that we can stabilize the economy. We’re putting a lot of money into the hospitals. I think the president has every expectation this is going to look a lot better four or eight weeks from now.’",2020-02-23 12:48:08+00:00,
Corona Virus Outbreak Due To Use Of Dog Meat in Chinese Wuhan Wet Markets,"The coronavirus spreading in China and the SARS outbreak of 2003 have two things in common: Both are from the coronavirus family, and both likely started in wet markets.

At such markets, outdoor stalls are squeezed together to form narrow lanes, where locals and visitors shop for cuts of meat and ripe produce. A stall selling hundreds of caged chickens may abut a butcher counter, where meat is chopped as nearby dogs watch hungrily. Some vendors hock skinned hares, while seafood stalls display glistening fish and shrimp.

Wet markets put people and live and dead animals — dogs, chickens, pigs, snakes, civets, and more — in constant close contact. That makes it easy for a virus to jump from animal to human.

On January 22, authorities in Wuhan, China — where the current outbreak started — banned the trade of live animals at wet markets. The specific market where the outbreak might have begun, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, was shuttered on January 1. The coronavirus that emerged there has so far killed at least 360 people and infected more than 17,400.

“Poorly regulated, live-animal markets mixed with illegal wildlife trade offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spillover from wildlife hosts into the human population,” the Wildlife Conservation Society said in a statement.

Coronaviruses are zoonotic diseases, meaning they spread to people from animals. In the case of SARS, and likely this Wuhan coronavirus outbreak as well, bats were the original hosts. The bats then infected other animals, which transmitted the virus to humans.

Here’s what Chinese wet markets look like.

The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan closed on January 1 after it was found to be the most likely starting point for the outbreak of this coronavirus, called 2019-nCov.

A 61-year-old man was the first person to die from the virus. According to Bloomberg, he was a regular shopper at the Huanan wet market, which sold more than seafood.

Reports indicate that before the Huanan market closed, vendors there sold seafood, meat, and live animals, including chickens, donkeys, sheep, pigs, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs, and snakes.

Wet markets like Huanan are common in China. They’re called wet markets because vendors often slaughter animals in front of customers.

“That means there’s a lot of skinning of dead animals in front of shoppers and, as a result, aerosolizing of all sorts of things,” Emily Langdon, an infectious disease specialist at University of Chicago Medicine, wrote in an article.

A report published on Friday challenges the idea that virus emerged in the Huanan wet market, however.

Chinese scientists found that the first reported case of the Wuhan coronavirus from December had no link to the wet market, according to Science, which cited a report published in the medical journal, The Lancet.

What’s more, 13 of 41 coronavirus cases had no link to the Huanan marketplace, the researchers said. More research is needed to pinpoint the outbreak’s starting point with certainty.",2020-02-08 00:50:11+00:00,
China Accused Hiding Number of Corona Virus Deaths Cremating Bodies,"China has today admitted it was too slow to react to the coronavirus outbreak which has sparked a global panic and left at least 213 people dead – amid claims that Beijing could be covering up a higher death toll.

The secretary of the ruling Communist party in Wuhan admitted he felt ‘remorse’ over the outbreak, saying the virus’s impact ‘would have been less’ if measures had been taken sooner.

The killer virus has spread around the world with the first cases in Britain confirmed today as governments scramble to close their borders and retrieve their worried citizens from Wuhan.

China has since imposed a drastic quarantine on Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market and infected humans.

Officials today raised the death toll to 213 with nearly 10,000 people infected, but there are fears that the official figures are ‘way too low’ – sparking claims of a cover-up.

California Governor:’I don’t think the schools are going to open again’,"SACRAMENTO — California’s schools will likely stay closed for the rest of the academic year over coronavirus concerns, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday in a jaw-dropping prediction for families barely settling into new weekday routines with children at home.

“This is a very sobering thing to say,” Newsom said, as he warned that schools are unlikely to reopen in the coming weeks and will more than likely remain closed until the summer break. “I don’t want to mislead you.”

If it holds true, more than 6 million California public school students would remain home for an unprecedented length of time unless the state finds alternatives.

Nearly 99 percent of the state’s schools have closed, though Newsom has not issued a state mandate requiring them to do so, citing concerns about the impact on low-income families.

Newsom also announced Tuesday that he has requested a waiver from the U.S. Department of Education to pause standardized testing.

The governor said he told his daughter Monday night, “‘Honey, I don’t think the schools are going to open again.'”

“Boy, I hope I’m wrong, but I believe that to be the case,” he added.

Newsom said he wanted to be candid with families in California, and that he felt he should explain to everyone what he’s telling his own children based on the information he has.

Earlier Tuesday, Kansas became the first U.S. state to officially close schools for the remainder of the academic year.

The governor signed an executive order last week assuring school districts that they will receive their funding if they close due to the coronavirus and instructing them to use the money for distance learning and other resources for students and families. Days into widespread closures, schools and teachers are blazing their own path on remote instruction, a situation almost no program fully prepared for because K-12 classes are almost universally held in person.

The order requires that closed schools provide meals to students in “non-congregate” settings, continue to pay employees and “to the extent practicable,” arrange for supervision of students during school hours.

Newsom said Tuesday that further guidance will be issued to schools on how to conduct distance learning for the time being.",2020-03-18 20:06:04+00:00,
"Coronavirus fears have spurred a stock market sell-off, Potential Market Crash Looming","Wall Street is waking up to the threat of the coronavirus.

The stock market took a dip Monday morning in the face of increasing fears about the coronavirus’s potential impact on the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all ended the day down by more than 3 percent. The Dow tumbled by more than 1,000 points, erasing its gains for the year.

There have been concerns about the coronavirus for months, but worries about itapproaching pandemic status have been building in recent days. As Vox’s Julia Belluz explained, as of Monday, there were more than 79,000 cases of Covid-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus strain) in 29 countries.

While most cases have been found in China, countries around the world have reported surges in recent days, including Italy, Iran, and South Korea. Italy quarantined multiple towns and canceled the Venice Carnival and several football events. And an outbreak on a cruise ship outside Japan has increased concerns, too. “The likelihood that we’re in a pandemic, a new disease that spreads around the world — or that we’re hurtling toward one — seems higher than just a week ago,” Belluz wrote.

The World Health Organization said it believes there’s still time to contain the virus and that its epidemic peak may be declining in China, but other experts believe the virus has already spread widely and anticipate epidemics around the world. Either way, the threat is causing ripples across global stock markets and economies.

An investor survey conducted by the market insight and research firm DataTrek Research released on Sunday found that most investors still believe coronavirus will not cause a global economic recession, and only about one-third of them had made changes to their or their clients’ portfolios, taking into account the risks of the disease. But it’s worth noting the survey was collected between Tuesday and Saturday of last week, before the latest wave of fear-inducing news hit.

In a note to clients on Monday, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at the research firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned that “virus-induced nerves will persist until non-China cases decline” and said there’s still a lot of uncertainty on the impact of the coronavirus. “At this point, no one knows — and no one can know — whether these fears [around the virus] will prove justified, which means that markets are now slaves to the news,” he wrote.

The spread of the disease in China and elsewhere has already impacted global supply chains and travel, and the situation could worsen. Last week, Apple said it would slash sales expectations, noting its smartphone supply was going to slow because so much of its production is based in China, and saying that demand for its devices in China had been harmed. As CNBC noted on Monday, the coronavirus-induced market slide was specifically felt by airlines and chipmakers. And it’s not just US stocks that are suffering — markets around the globe shuddered, too.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Monday told CNBC that the US economy still looks pretty solid, but President Donald Trump’s trade war and coronavirus are cause for concern. “Tariffs — the tariff situation was a big question mark for all kinds of companies. And still is to some degree. But that was front and center for a while. Now, coronavirus is front and center,” he said.

While the coronavirus news and its potential effects on the global economy and markets are worrying, it’s important not to panic. (Today is perhaps not the day to look at your 401(k) balance.) The Dow is just slightly below where it started in 2020, and it’s about 2,000 points above where it was this time a year ago.",2019-02-25 05:53:37+00:00,
5-Year-Old Girl Tests Positive for Coronavirus Possibly Infected Other Classmates,"HOWARD COUNTY, MD — Maryland’s first child to test positive for the new coronavirus is a 5-year-old from Howard County who attended Elkridge Elementary School. The state has 107 confirmed cases, up from 85 on Wednesday, the same day the state reported its first coronavirus death, a Prince George’s County man in his 60s with underlying health issues.

“We have our first pediatric case of coronavirus. Coronavirus, as we know, does not discriminate … we are going to continue to see more confirmed cases. We must do our part to flatten the curve and ultimately save lives,” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said at a Thursday afternoon press conference. “Avoid group gatherings, playdates and visitors to your home. Do not congregate in any public private spaces. This means walking trails, basketball courts, playgrounds and more.”

Howard County Health Officer Dr. Maura Rossman said the child was evaluated by medical professionals and sent home to recuperate. They do not believe she shared the virus at school. All schools in Maryland are tentatively closed through March 27.

“Given the timeframe of onset, the child was not an exposure risk to children and staff at school. While this is the first coronavirus case in a child in Maryland, we know that children, teens and young adults are all able to get the virus. It does not discriminate,” Rossman said. “Anyone can get sick regardless of what country and what state and what county they live in and what age they are. We must recognize when children or anyone is sick with the virus that a larger concern is they pass the disease along to seniors or those with underlying health issues. They are the groups more adversely effected and may require hospitalization — and may not recover.”

Rossman emphasized that “now is the time to stay home.”

“In capital letters, STAY HOME. As difficult as it may be, staying home the next couple of weeks will help flatten the curve, slow the virus and save lives,” she said.

People must re-evaluate how they live their lives, Rossman said.

“If you must go out into public, use social distancing … continue to wash your hands and do it frequently. We know this is the single most effective way to prevent getting sick,” she said.",2020-03-20 00:53:44+00:00,
Government Considering Sending Every American $1000 Right Away as Global Recession Looms,"The idea of quickly sending every American adult a $1,000 check in order to stimulate the rapidly faltering American economy began to gain some traction on Monday in the halls of power in Washington D.C. with Republican Senator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) coming out in favor of it even as the stock market sustained its largest single-day percentage drop ever on top of what had already been a bad week.

A thousand-dollar-a-month “Freedom Dividend” had been the centerpiece talking point of Andrew Yang’s campaign for the Democratic nomination for president in recent months before he dropped out of the race. What just a few weeks ago seemed like a quixotic idea may actually happen far faster than anyone ever anticipated, albeit for only one or perhaps two months, depending on how long Americans find themselves stranded at home with severely reduced job activity until the threat of the coronavirus is deemed past.

Despite the seeming similarity to Yang’s proposal, there is a big difference between a one-of stimulus check for $1,000 and the long-debated theories surrounding a “Universal Basic Income” which calls for such a program to continue month-after-month for every adult citizen in perpetuity. There are; however, a couple of precedents: In 2001 and again in 2009 the government mailed out checks to some taxpayers in order to try and directly counter the effects of a recession.

US jails begin releasing prisoners to stop spread of Covid-19 infections,"US jails are to let out inmates as cases of coronavirus infections are being reported in prisons.

New York City is releasing “vulnerable” prisoners, the mayor said on Wednesday, days after Los Angeles and Cleveland freed hundreds of inmates.

Prison reform advocates say those in jail are at higher risk of catching and passing on Covid-19.

There have been more than 9,400 cases of Covid-19 and 152 deaths in the US so far, according to estimates.

Globally there are some 220,000 confirmed cases and over 8,800 deaths.

What happened in New York City?

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday that city officials will this week identify individuals for release, including people who were arrested for minor crimes and those most vulnerable to infection due to underlying health problems.

His announcement came hours after a guard and a prisoner tested positive for coronavirus at Rikers Island prison, where disgraced former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, 68, is a high-profile inmate.

Weinstein will be moved to a different state prison, an official said on Wednesday.

Other New York prisons, such as Sing Sing, have had inmates test positive for coronavirus and one employee for the state’s corrections department has died from it .

What have other US jurisdictions done?

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department reduced it’s inmate population by 600 in the last two weeks, officials said on Tuesday.

“Our population within our jails is a vulnerable population just by who they are, where they are located, so we’re protecting that population from potential exposure,” Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters earlier this week.

The LA County jail system is the largest prison system in the world with an average population of around 22,000 prisoners.

Mr Villaneuva disclosed that arrests in the county are also down, from an average of 300 per weekend to only 60 in mid-March.",2020-03-20 00:22:39+00:00,
People are Snorting Cocaine & Drinking Bleach to Cure Coronavirus,"Jesus Christ, sometimes I really hate the internet. People come up with the strangest and most stupid things I’ve ever heard of. Like this nonsense. Apparently, there are rumors going around on social media that drinking chlorine dioxide and snorting cocaine can cure the coronavirus. WHAT!?

Reality check, guys this is not true. If you actually believe this, you seriously need to go back to school. It really blows my mind that we have to remind people about something like this. As far as I know, snorting cocaine has absolutely no medical benefits and well, it happens to be illegal. Not only that, but the FDA has been warning people for years that drinking bleach not only ruins your system, but causes severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, life-threatening low blood pressure which is caused by dehydration, and acute liver failure.

Now, all though chlorine dioxide isn’t exactly bleach, it is toxic, and well, you should not be ingesting it to cure Covid-19. I get it guys, this whole coronavirus outbreak is scary, the whole world is freaking out. Which is why we shouldn’t even joke about fake cures things like this. This is dangerous, there are a lot of people who actually depend on the internet for information and there could be serious side effects.

These two factors will not kill the coronavirus, rather they will kill you. Bleach isn’t a miracle mineral solution. According to the CDC,the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. What does that mean, well, the virus is spread mainly from person to person between people who are in close contact with one another within 6 feet. Health officials state it can also be passed through respiratory droplets which are produced when an infected person sneezes or coughs on another person. So what can we do to prevent getting sick?



Even though you’ve probably heard this a million times, the best way is to wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or more and after you’ve been in a public place, you sneeze, cough, or blow your nose. If you don’t have water accessible to you, you can use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and covers all surfaces of your hands. You should also avoid touching your nose, mouth, eyes, and face overall.

If you start to feel ill, it’s better to stay at home and get medical care so you don’t expose others. If you are sick, you should wear face masks when you’re around other people and before you enter a Health Care Provider’s office. No, you do not need to wear a face mask if you are not sick unless you’re caring for someone who is sick. Last but not least remember that cleaning will be your best friend. This includes doorknobs, tables, light switch, handles, yes, countertops, phone, I can go on and on and on.

Moral of the story, just be aware of your surroundings people. Oh and also, don’t do cocaine and don’t drink bleach, that’s just stupid y’all",2020-03-19 20:15:31+00:00,

US President Donald Trump on Monday suggested to his supporters that he might fire Anthony Fauci, the country’s chief expert on infectious diseases, from his second-term cabinet.

While holding a campaign rally in Florida in the early hours of the day, Trump took issue with the media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting the crowd to chant “Fire Fauci.”

“Don’t tell anybody but let me wait until a little bit after the election”, Trump replied, as quoted by CNN, thanking his supporters for the advice.

A video of the moment has been circulating in social media.

The security boost is in preparation for election day and mass protests and rioting that may follow, especially if the outcome is not immediately certain. Many business owners in large US cities, including Washington DC, have similarly pessimistic expectations and have been boarding up their shops against possible vandalism and looting.

The White House used additional barriers earlier this year when mass protests were happening near the complex in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota.

Anti-Lockdown Protests Erupt Across Spain,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Social unrest erupted across Spanish cities for the second consecutive night on Saturday after the government’s decision to extend a six-month state of emergency in response to the second wave of COVID-19 infections.

Anti-lockdown protesters flooded the streets of Madrid and Barcelona on Saturday night. At least 32 people were arrested and 12 injured when demonstrations turned violent with police in Madrid. Other protests were seen in Malaga, Vitoria, Valencia, Santander, and Burgos, reported RT News.

On Saturday evening, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, called for calm as the violent protests intensified. He tweeted:

“Only from responsibility, unity, and sacrifice will we be able to defeat the pandemic that devastates all countries. Violent and irrational behavior by minority groups is intolerable. It is not the way.”

The extension of the national state of emergency order comes as coronavirus infection cases, on Saturday alone, topped 26,000, one of the highest totals since the start of the pandemic.

“Lawlessness” was the best way to describe the chaotic events in Madrid, tweeted Insider Paper.

RT New said, “protesters clashed with police in the capital city of Madrid, vandalizing ATMs, as well as breaking and burning trash cans in the city center.”

Meanwhile, in Barcelona, anti-lockdown protesters were upset about the nationwide curfew and how it would continue to crush the economy.

Keep up to date with our latest:

US President Donald Trump has criticized several European countries for announcing fresh nationwide lockdowns, describing the measures as “draconian.”

“What the hell are they [Europe] doing?” Trump told a campaign rally in Michigan. “I think I’ll go over and explain it to them.”

He warned voters that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, would mimic those tough measures and pledged to never shut down parts of the US again.

“I am delivering the great American comeback and we are not having any lockdowns. That I can tell you, there’s no lockdowns,” he said to loud cheers from the crowd.

On Saturday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a strict new lockdown would take effect across England from Thursday until early December.

The country follows Germany, Austria and France who announced new curbs on movement this week amid a huge surge in coronavirus infections.

Both candidates for Tuesday’s US presidential election made a last-minute scramble to attract voters in battleground states. Biden — who polls say is maintaining an overall lead over Trump — hit back over the president’s record on the pandemic.

“More than 230,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 — and Donald Trump has given up on trying to get the virus under control,” he said on Twitter.

“He may have quit on you, but I promise I never will.”

As well as Michigan, Trump was visiting Iowa, North Carolina; Georgia and Florida for further rallies Sunday. Biden was traveling to Pennsylvania to address his supporters and will be joined on stage in Philadelphia by Lady Gaga and John Legend.

US ‘positioned poorly’

Meanwhile, the US government’s top infectious diseases expert said the country should prepare for “a whole lot of hurt” in the weeks ahead due to surging coronavirus cases.

Dr. Anthony Fauci told the Washington Post that the US “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” to stem rising cases as more people gather indoors during the colder fall and winter months.

Fauci, who is on the White House coronavirus task force, added that he believes Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden “is taking it [the pandemic] seriously from a public health perspective,” while Trump is “looking at it from a different perspective.”

In response, White House spokesman Judd Deere said Fauci had decided “to play politics” right before Tuesday’s presidential election.",11/2/20 9:41,
Report: Biden Presidency Would Add $11 TRILLION To National Debt,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

If Joe Biden were to be elected his Presidency would cost American taxpayers $11 trillion dollars, according to a study by The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.

The conservative 501 found that Biden’s proposals on social security, health care, climate and infrastructure could plunge the US into a debt crisis.

Speaking to the Daily Caller, author of the report Brian Riedl noted that “The policies he’s proposing are going to endanger the economy over the long term,” adding “$4 trillion in new taxes, which is the biggest tax increase since the end of World War II, as well as $11 trillion in new spending, certainly more regulation, a higher minimum wage. All of that is going to weaken the economy.”

For those interested, I've released the new 2020 version of my budget chartbook. 100 pages of charts that defy conventional wisdom on budget, spending, tax, and deficits. You can download the chartbook here – https://t.co/rKZ20fxvuk — Brian Riedl 🧀 (@Brian_Riedl) October 27, 2020

Biden has proposed $2.4 trillion in coronavirus stimulus spending, as well as $2 trillion for climate and infrastructure, and a $1.5 trillion health care expansion. It is estimated that education spending will amount to $750 billion under Biden, which includes a free college plan.

Biden has offered little in the way of explaining how the costs will be covered, other than tax hikes, which he claims will be targeted at large corporations.

The problem is beginning with a $13 trillion baseline deficit over the decade, adding $11 trillion in new spending promises, and then hoping a $3.5 trillion tax increase on the rich will make the numbers work. Eventually, big middle-class benefits require big middle class taxes. https://t.co/G6AmsbfytG — Brian Riedl 🧀 (@Brian_Riedl) October 5, 2020

Bets are in, and the odds look heavily in Trump’s favor and it’s because the betting tables have all the right data.

The numbers were crunched using figures from Biden’s campaign website, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Congressional Budget Office.

“It’s absolutely unsustainable,” Riedl noted adding that “The danger is that eventually the interest costs will bury us. When you borrow that much money, all it takes is a small increase in interest rates to completely bury the federal budget.”

“Ultimately, we’re going to face a reckoning that requires either significant reforms to programs like Social Security and Medicare, or a possible doubling of middle class taxes,” Riedl warned, declaring that “There’s really no third option.”

“The worst case scenario is that politicians continue to pour gasoline on the fire by enacting even more spending, which just accelerates a debt crisis,” Riedl urged.

Under President Trump, the deficit has remained under $1 trillion each year. However, it is projected to jump to almost 4 times that this year due to coronavirus spending.",11/2/20 5:28,
UK government justifies 2nd national lockdown using outdated death scenarios that may be 4 times too high – researchers,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

The British government has used out-of-date death-scenario modelling to illustrate the coronavirus crisis and justify a second national lockdown, new research shows.

The selection of data has not been based on the current reality, Carl Heneghan, the director of the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University said, in comments published on Monday.

The death forecasts could be four to five times too high, Heneghan insists.

I cannot understand why they have used this data, when there are far more up-to-date forecasts from Cambridge that they could have accessed, which show something very different.

The government’s scientific advisers showed a scenario from Cambridge University at a Downing Street press conference on Saturday, and graphs suggested England could see 4,000 daily deaths early next month. But this data was based on different models from at least three weeks ago, Heneghan and Daniel Howdon of Leeds Institute of Health Sciences explained on Monday.

In a insightful Interview with the BBC in 1999, David Bowie properly predicts the terrifying reality of what the internet has done to our society.

The Cambridge estimated projection for November 1 is 1,000 deaths, the experts said.

The most recent research from Cambridge forecasts 240 daily deaths for next week, while this figure stands at around 500 in the second half of November.

Two model estimates presented by the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) have already proven to be invalid, according to Heneghan and Howdon. They say these analyses need checking to verify whether the lower estimates could reflect the actual data.

Britain’s PM Boris Johnson on Saturday ordered England back into a national lockdown from Thursday morning, until December 2, and the SAGE figures were behind the decision.

How Long Will It Take To Count All The Votes?,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

For months the American people have been told that we may not know the winner of the presidential election right away like we normally do.

So if we aren’t going to have a winner on November 3rd, when will we finally have a clear result?

Well, that is going to depend on how long it takes to count the votes, and that is going to be different for each state.

I know that is a frustrating answer, but every one of our 50 states has different election laws, and things have been greatly complicated in 2020 by the fact that so many people will be voting by mail.

A new Project Veritas video exposes even more corruption now taking place in the Republican party!

So far, more than 46 million Americans have already voted by mail, and that number just keeps growing with each passing day.

Some states allow mail-in ballots to be counted before Election Day, but a majority of states do not…

A majority of states won’t start actually counting ballots until the morning of Election Day or after polls close. Most counting rules have remained unchanged this year, though some states have adjusted their timelines due to the pandemic to ease the burden of increased absentee ballots.

So that means that there will be tens of millions of mail-in ballots that will be piled up waiting to be counted in addition to all of the ballots that come in on Election Day.

I feel sorry for those that have to open up all of those ballots and get them counted, because that is going to be a monumental task.

As I discussed yesterday, there are six key swing states that are pretty much going to determine the outcome of this election. In three of them, the lack of a sufficient head start in counting ballots is likely to greatly delay voting results…

But final results in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan could be unclear on election night because these states are expected to be the three slowest to count the high volume of absentee ballots. The reason: Pennsylvania and Wisconsin don’t allow the processing of mail-in ballots to begin until Election Day and Michigan only has a 10-hour start, compared to other states that start that can start the process days or weeks in advance.

Whoever wins Pennsylvania is probably going to win the presidency, but it could be quite a while before we get a final result from that state.

You see, the truth is that counting mail-in ballots is much more tedious that running normal ballots through a machine. There are several steps involved, and each step takes time…

Processing absentee ballots generally includes steps short of tabulating them — such as removing them from the envelope, confirming voter eligibility, matching signatures to what’s on record and scanning them.

And on top of everything else, sometimes unexpected problems occur.

For example, ballot counting machines in one county in Texas have been “rejecting about one-third of mail-in ballots” and authorities are scrambling to get this issue resolved…

Ballot scanning machines are rejecting about one-third of mail-in ballots returned by voters in Tarrant County. The problem has impacted more than 22,000 ballots so far. Ballot board members are now working in 12-hour shifts to accurately replicate the ballots so they can be counted.

As I have warned before, you will want to vote in person to give yourself the best chance of having your vote actually count.

In addition to everything that I have already discussed, it is important to remember that mail-in votes will continue to be accepted in many states long after Election Day is over.

I know that sounds really bizarre, but this is what is actually going to happen. In fact, Washington State will count votes that are received as late as November 23rd…

The last day to vote in-person in the general election is Nov. 3. Absentee and mail-in ballots also typically must be received or postmarked by that date, if not earlier, depending on a state’s rules. That leaves some room for mail-in ballots to be received after Election Day. In Washington State, mail-in ballots received as late as Nov. 23 are still valid, as long as they were postmarked by Nov. 3.

National polls have shown that Biden voters are much more likely to vote by mail and Trump voters are much more likely to vote in person.

The votes that are cast in person will be counted very quickly. Meanwhile, the votes that are sent in by mail will take weeks to fully count.

The mainstream media and the big tech companies have been working very hardto mentally prepare us for a massive “blue shift” after Election Day. One of the reasons why they are so adamant that Trump should not declare victory on November 3rd is because they are confident that Joe Biden will ultimately win once all of the mail-in ballots are finally counted.

In some states we will have final results almost immediately, but in other states counting could take quite a few weeks.

But the counting cannot take too long, because by law election results must be officially certified by certain deadlines…

According to Ballotpedia, citing state laws, six states must certify election results within a week of the general election; 26 states and Washington, D.C., have a deadline between Nov. 10 and Nov. 30; 14 have a deadline in December, and four do not have deadlines in their state laws. Among key battleground states, those deadlines range from Nov. 11 (Pennsylvania) to Dec. 1 (Nevada and Wisconsin). For potential battleground Texas, it is Dec. 3.

I don’t know how some of those states are going to possibly meet those deadlines.

In particular, I have no idea how Pennsylvania is going to be done counting by November 11th. Hopefully they have a vast army of counters and a whole lot of coffee.

To give you an idea of how long it takes to count mail-in ballots, just consider what we witnessed in California earlier this year…

Consider this year’s California primary, in which 5.8 million people voted for president. Only 3 million of those ballots were counted by election night; the other 2.8 million votes took an additional seven weeks to count, said John Couvillon, a pollster and political analyst.

If it took California seven weeks to count a couple million mail-in ballots, how in the world is Pennsylvania going to count a similar number of mail-in ballots in just one week?

Personally, I am anticipating that this election is going to be a colossal mess. As I have been documenting on The Most Important News, voting anomalies have already been popping up all over the nation, and I think that counting all of the mail-in ballots is going to take much more time than anticipated.

And any legal battles over the counting of the votes will just make the process even more painful.

We were once a great example for the rest of the world, but in 2020 we are going to show the rest of the planet the exact wrong way to conduct an election, and that is a real shame.",10/28/20 2:30,
Sniffer Dogs Could Be Used to Detect if Someone is Infected With COVID,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Sniffer dogs that can detect if someone is infected with COVID-19 could be used to patrol public areas such as airports and other busy venues in the near future.

Health minister Lord Bethell praised an “extremely exciting” trial taking place in the UK that tests whether dogs can be trained to identify unique odours associated with the coronavirus infection.

With Finland having already deployed corona-sniffing dogs at its main international airport, similar measures could soon be rolled out across the west.

UK Secretary of State Matt Hancock, an ardent lockdown advocate, will visit the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to see for himself the accuracy of the tests.

“Dogs can be used as a way of screening crowds in places like airports and high-density venues,” said Lord Bethell.

And there you were thinking you’d just have to tolerate masks, mandatory government apps and vaccines to get about in the “new normal”.

ROGER STONE: How the Democrats Plan to Steal the 2020 Election,"It is now just a few days until America finally renders its fateful choice for President on on Election Day 2020. But Democrat manipulations to buy time to conduct as much voter fraud as possible have made it more like Election MONTH 2020.

As President Donald Trump tirelessly barnstorms the country, firing up voters from all walks of life at increasingly massive rallies that epitomize political Americana, Democrat Joe Biden is staggering around the political stage, desperately hoping to run out the clock and avoid any of the exploding controversy around his treasonous secret business dealings with the communist Chinese, among other appalling revelations.

Biden’s campaign communications team – also known as the entire corporate “mainstream” media and all major social media and information platforms – are scurrying about crazily in an unprecedented suppression and censorship rampage to ensure that the growing body of authenticated evidence of Joe Biden’s active complicity in his son Hunter’s influence pedaling in Ukraine, China and Kazakhstan receives zero coverage, effectively bamboozling the American electorate.

While his cynical media protectorate shields the doddering Delaware Democrat from long-overdue exposure of his appalling corruption and greed, Biden cowers in the basement bunker of his sprawling multimillion dollar estate in Chateau Country, Delaware. Biden’s “campaign” is now pretty basic: no rallies, no press conferences, no exposure to media questions, no impromptu (or any) interaction with actual voters, and not a peep about any of the sludge now bubbling up out of the Biden Crime Family sewer.

Every once in a while Biden’s handlers (controllers) prop him up and drag him out to a contrived platform appearance somewhere in Pennsylvania just a short drive from the Biden bunker/compound, where the cognitively-impaired 78 year old bumbles his way through jumbotron teleprompted remarks to some small highly-screened group of voters, from a safe distance of course (no handshaking, baby kissing, or even elbow bumping), just so his media army can show the world proof of life.

Before going dark (and into hiding) Biden explicitly promised (threatened) to raise taxes (a bit of bravado that didn’t not work out so well for another former Democrat Vice-President running for the top job four years too late, Walter Mondale). In a bit of uplifting optimism, the mask-pusher from Scranton-Claymont predicted a “dark winter” for America – nothing like gloom and doom to inspire a country suffering under Democrat lockdown mania. In short, Biden is doing the worst thing any political candidate can do – he’s sitting on a lead, trying to run out the clock. Biden’s effort is so lifeless and lackluster that I am reminded of something President Nixon used to say to me: “Stone, in politics the only thing worse than being wrong is being boring.”

Donald Trump, by contrast, has stolen (or brilliantly rewritten) a page from the last landslide Republican president, Ronald Reagan, by bombarding Democrat strongholds with an upbeat message of hope and sunny optimism. The endlessly-energetic Trump lays out his impressive record and reassures voters that, contrary to Joe Biden’s vision of a Dark Winter for America, ‘the best is yet to come.’

Touting his extraordinary record of job creation and wage growth, this president dominates the political stage as a happy warrior, but also one who is equally fearless in excoriating the Democrats and their propaganda fluffers in the corporate mainstream (fake news) media. His tireless come-from-behind effort is interesting, entertaining and inspirational.

His Trump Rallies are becoming the stuff of political legend. But even moreso, they are presidential campaign rocket fuel. While the President draws strength and resolve from the enormous crowds of fired-up Americans who flock to see him, they, in turn, are infused with his infectious energy, moved to action by the confidence and enthusiasm he imparts with his every word and his commanding presence.

Democrats know their candidate is weak and that his ‘supporters’ have the intensity of a room full of dental patients waiting for a tooth extraction. Their sum total of their message is “we hate Trump”, higher taxes, more regulation and a re-constituted reign of error by the Democrats’ bellicose, ossified political lifers, only now with a burgeoning splinter of aggressive proto-communist zealots driving their demagogic ideology.

Desperate Democrat power-seekers and their Trump-deranged RINO fellow travelers know Biden’s lead is dwindling (if he ever really had one, given the Trump-hate media and political class’s pathological inability to utter so much as a breath that does not denigrate or diminish the object of their endless scorn and vicious hatred). The leftist Democrat shock troops are already torquing up their (well-organized, well-funded) mob violence on the streets of New York and Philadelphia – a glimmer of the diabolical plans by which they will to go to any lengths and use any means necessary to defeat Donald Trump…or destroy the country in the process.

They are already in the process of resorting to widespread voter fraud to stop the quickly rising Trump and have troweled up a practical army of at least 600 sleazy lawfare specialists from the bottom of the Democrat lawyer cesspool, eagerly scheming to pressure election boards to ratify various Democrat election-stealing fraud schemes like ballot harvesting. While this noxious army of political ambulance chasers swarm over the land seeking to manufacture delay, disarray and uncertainty until or unless they can rig the defeat of Donald Trump, the Biden Democrat-fomented criminal street mobs will augment this chaos-driven pressure with violent “protests” and destructive riots.

From all of the polling I have examined, this presidential race may be as close as the Bush v Gore race in 2000 and the 1960 contest between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Bush v. Gore was, of course, resolved in the U.S. Supreme Court. Kennedy versus Nixon was resolved by the magnanimity and patriotic fidelity of Vice-President Richard Nixon. Attorneys for Nixon had already gathered more than enough evidence of widespread and systematic Democrat voter fraud in Illinois and Texas (which was extremely well-documented at the time in a detailed series of articles in The New York Herald Tribune), but Nixon selflessly decided against putting the country through the agony of a divisive, drawn-out legal process to eliminate the fruits of Democrat fraud and honestly determine who was the rightful President. Interestingly, American war hero and straight arrow, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, joined a number of prominent Americans urging Nixon to wage a no holds-barred legal challenge to the questionable victory of Democrat John Kennedy.

If my premonition of a razor-thin margin of victory by one candidate or the other turns out to be accurate, it is absolutely imperative that the Trump Campaign, the Republican National Committee and the “Stop The Steal” organization of Republican lawyers working to ensure the integrity of this election, ready to sort out the what and the who of the Democrats’ election fraud, immediately mobilize around one effort. They must have voters lined up and ready who have standing to file the appropriate legal petitions, pleadings and motions to challenge questionable results and expose fraudulent activities wherever they have occurred. They must be prepared to collect and submit persuasive hard evidence detailing all voter fraud and expose those who planned, paid for, solicited or perpetrated these crimes.

As I said, Democrats have an illegal ballot harvesting plan in full swing and are coordinating with the foreign-funded domestic terror groups BLM and Antifa to foment violence and political instability in order the steal the 2020 election. Behind all of this organized Democrat corruption is a sleazy legal trickster and Democrat hatchet man named Norm Eisen, who actually wrote a manual or guidebook outlining how he was behind the same type of violent insurrection in other countries – and how he plans to use the same tactics to hijack our election next Tuesday. Eisen’s international trademark is a scenario in which insurrectionist forces engineer various contrivances to loudly contest a national election, while also mobilizing massive protests in support of seizing the election in their favor. These astro-turfed riots are falsely portrayed as “peaceful protests” or acts of civil disobedience, when they are in fact violent destructive mobs.

Eisen wrote a detailed “how to” book for radical revolution, literally called the “Playbook”. This diabolical manual for mass manipulation lays out scenarios for the overthrow of democratically elected governments overseas, which Eisen sought to topple. It includes plans for engineering election fraud scenarios and then using election fraud as the pretext to engineer mass protests intended to cast doubt on the legitimacy of election result.

This un-American slimeball Eisen has been a chief architect of the underhanded, dishonest and even seditious impeachment efforts waged against President Trump, as well as over 180 frivolous or malicious lawsuits against Trump and his political allies. He had already authored ten articles of impeachment against President Trump before the President’s phone call to the President of Ukraine, which Democrats absurdly distorted, misrepresented and inflated into their laughable grounds for impeachment, had even taken place. Eisen was Special Counsel to the Democrats for the impeachment process he had himself engineered.

This ruthless lawyer thug and Democrat zealot Eisen will employ the usual Democrat lawfare tricks to try to steal or overturn the 2020 election, with street thugs as his Plan B. Republicans must be prepared to fight this effort both in the courts and through mobilization of legitimate peaceful protests.

The big stash of ballots that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar got caught with trace directly to Eisen’s ballot-harvesting operation. This is but one strand in a sprawling vote fraud web which can be traced, and proved if necessary, to similar criminal operations underway in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia and Arizona.

I firmly believe, and can look to their long history of engaging in it, that Democrat criminals are, and will be, engaging in widespread voter fraud in various forms including mail-in voting abuse, illegal ballot harvesting, multiple votes cast by one individual, votes cast in the name of persons who are deceased or no longer reside in the voting jurisdiction and manipulation of computerized voting machine tabulations. I know that there will be credible evidence of this everywhere it is perpetrated, if for no other reason than, while Democrat masterminds like Eisen may be crafty little manipulators who slither around in the shadows undetected, the average Democrat thug hired, or otherwise willing, to carry out the necessary election fraud tasks is going to reflect the Democrat base in being either sloppy, stupid, or both, and will leave a trail of evidence behind.

The President’s lawyers and a supporting network of diligent attorneys willing to join the fight against this criminal effort to steal the presidency and more, must be prepared and organized to collect and catalog credible evidence showing the Democrats’ systematic vote fraud campaign, while preserving all available legal options to challenge the results, even if (when) the fake news media works overtime to stampede the public into rubber-stamping a fraudulent election, stealing the presidency if not the Congress too.

To pull off their version of a “color revolution”, Democrats and their fake news propaganda machine in mainstream media have set up a cynical diversionary effort. In recent weeks, corporate-owned Democrat shill media has been in overdrive falsely and maliciously smearing and defaming a fraternal organization called the “Proud Boys,” an extraordinarily small group of mostly young men of all races and identities (the national chairman is a black latino of Cuban descent) who are essentially a drinking society. Truly vile Democrat stooges in media have published libelous and slanderous statements falsely labeling these men as “white supremacists.” Having absolutely ZERO evidence to substantiate this defamation, all they do is cite a criminal front group run by leftist zealots called the “Southern Poverty Law Center” or SPLC (an organization whose name is three lies in one).

The radical leftists behind this shady defamation factory disguised as a public interest group are neither neutral nor objective, and are a credible arbiter of absolutely nothing on this planet. They have been a malicious propaganda generator against anyone with views that are anything right of the Chamber of Commerce. This evil organization was essentially setup as a money-making scam for left-wing fundraiser Morris Dees, used to fleece well-intentioned low-dollar liberal donors of their money, thinking they were sending money to fight extremists on the right, like Gerald Ford. Meanwhile, they defame as a Nazi or Klansman anyone who doesn’t actively profess twisted hard left doctrine or bow down before the likes of Elizabeth Warren.

That said, their lies about the Proud Boys have been fodder for a despicable smear campaign by the corporate Democrat media which has progressed to totally-false utterly-fabricated insinuations that the Proud Boys are going to suppress votes by menacing , harassing and assaulting voters at polling places.

I predict here and now that no Trump-supporter anywhere of any kind will in any way intimidate or harass voters at the polls, nor even attempt such conduct. Because the left always accuses their opponents of whatever crimes or treachery in which they are themselves engaged, or planning to engage, I am concerned about the Norm Eisen – Mark Elias – Neal Katyal scheme to steal the 2020 election and the presidency, using Black Lives Matter and Antifa to intimidate and harass Trump voters at the polling places in order to suppress the Trump vote – particularly among older citizens.

The head Democrat election thief Eisen calls his ballot fraud/lawfare/street violence operation (what else?) a “Voter Protection Project”. It is anything but that, but one must acknowledge how clever these liberals can be in their nefarious scheming and scamming.

BLM and Antifa have demonstrated beyond question that they have the numbers, funding, structure and organization to stage such violent suppressive incidents at carefully selected polling locations around the country. The notion that Antifa is, per Joe Biden in the first presidential debate, merely “an idea” or “ideology” and not an actual organization is, aside from being lunacy, disproved by their criminally violent and well-organized actions in recent months. Someone is paying for trucks, buses, U-Hauls and pallets of bricks, as well as the lawyers who show up instantaneously with bail money whenever one of these violent terrorists is arrested.

That America is awash with dark money to fund these terrorist operations and the insurrection they seek to foment is beyond question at this point. These are the thugs who will lead the wave of violence that Mr. Eisen and his cohorts have planned to use the pressure tactic against the vote counters, while Mr. Katyal and his band of manipulative lawyer thugs badger and threaten them with legal maneuvers.

In recent days the Democrat propaganda fake news media juggernaut has taken on the practice of distorting virtually everything I say, ever since the Soviet-style show trial I was put through in Washington D.C. This has only escalated since President’s humanitarian act of justice and mercy, commuting the outlandish sentence slapped on me by the vicious partisan judge who made sure I would never receive a fair trial and sought to incarcerate me immediately in a prison rife with COVID-19 cases, literally putting my life at great risk to sate their partisan malice. The President’s clemency by which I was able to escape certain death in a federal penitentiary has degenerate leftist zealots feeling denied the fruits of their lawless abuses of power and corruption of our courts as their illegitimate tool for political score-settling. Many will surely attack me for revealing the truth in this article.

Since they now twist and distort anything I say publicly, let me state it clearly and unequivocally: I renounce violence of any kind as a solution to any dispute over the outcome of the election taking place just days from now. If there is credible evidence of voter fraud sufficient to distort the election results, and the fake news media and violent shock-troops of the Democrat Party should attempt to stampede the country into accepting the illegitimate election of Joe Biden as president, the dispute must nonetheless be settled in the courts, not in the streets.

"ACLU Suing Police Across US For “Brutality” in Response to Riots, Looting","Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

In addition to having to deal with inept politicians and their respective police forces being harassed and assaulted across the U.S., cities are also starting to face another hurdle: lawsuits are stacking up alleging “police brutality” in dealing with “peaceful” protesters.

The New York ACLU, for example, has sued Mayor Bill de Blasio and police leadership and officers for how the city responded to protests over the summer, claiming NYPD used “brutal force,” according to Bloomberg.

Which is funny, because all we remember seeing from the summer was property destruction, looting, boarded up businesses and all hell generally breaking loose while Mayor De Blasio appeared to do nothing at all.

But, we digress. Regardless of whether they have merit, the lawsuits in New York and in other cities create even more financial liabilities for many U.S. cities that are already under distress. Similar cases are also being filed in Omaha, Nebraska; Los Angeles; New York; and Minneapolis.

A lawsuit filed this week against the NYPD said that they “unnecessarily used tools like batons and pepper spray on demonstrators and deployed tactics like kettling, in which police surround and trap a group in a location.”

Otherwise known as maintaining law and order.

The lawsuit, which also claims false imprisonment, alleges that the tactics resulted in a broken arm for one plaintiff. Daniel Lambright, an ACLU attorney, said: “What everybody saw in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder was egregious police misconduct and violations of protesters’ rights across the country but particularly in New York City. We don’t think there was a ‘bad apple’ problem. We think these were part of policies and practices endorsed by the mayor and the commissioner.”

Yes, the same mayor who, as far as we can remember, has worked to decriminalize everything he can get his hands on, from turnstile jumpers to people who urinate in public.

De Blasio commented: “From what I’ve heard of the lawsuit’s allegation, it doesn’t sound right at all to me. You know, there’s been a conscious effort for seven years now to change the relationship between the NYPD and communities.”

The lawsuits put economic pressure on cities when they can least afford it. State and local governments face a $467 billion decline in revenue from 2020 to 2022 as a result of the pandemic, Bloomberg notes:

In some localities, public safety already exceeds a third of general fund spending. Louisville, Kentucky, where Breonna Taylor was killed by police in March, spends 29% of its general fund budget on police. In Minnesota and Omaha, it’s 35% and 36%, respectively. New York City spends nearly 6% of its vast general fund on police, which comes out to more than $5 billion. Misconduct payouts are a further way departments pull on city purse strings.

Ironically, Joanna Schwartz, a professor at the UCLA School of Law, said that the lawsuits – filed against several cities where “defunding the police” is being called for by protesters – would “force cities to spend more on police.”",10/30/20 9:40,
The Fed’s Balance Sheet May Be Headed to $40–$50 Trillion,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

President Trump has said often that he had “created the greatest economy the world has ever seen, until the China virus came.”

Maybe some people believe that, but if the economy was so great why did the Fed keep interest rates at zero and its balance sheet at $4 trillion?

The president is bragging about the third quarter GDP bump; however, as David Rosenberg tweeted, “Even with the Q3 GDP snapback, a snapback that is now stalling, 2020 likely goes down with a –4% print, by far the worst year for the economy in the post-WWII era.”

Maybe the economy wasn’t so hot. Danielle DiMartino Booth, who once worked for Richard Fisher at the Dallas Fed, told Raoul Pal on Real Vision,

September the 16th [2019], when they launched Not QE. Because the inversion of the 2s 10s had passed the 30-day mark, and they’re like, oh my god, history says that we’re in recession. Well, no kidding, we’re in recession. World trade was contracting for the entire year of 2019. Lacy Hunt will tell you, you have to go back to the double-dip recession of the 1980s or 2007- 2009, that era, before you had global contraction in global trade. Of course, we were headed into recession. But it was very slow.

There were the good old days when the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet footed to all of $800 billion in assets. In November 2008, the depth of the great recession, the Fed’s assets exploded to over $2 trillion. By 2015, Fed total assets had reached $4.4 trillion. Of course, when coronavirus hit, Fed assets popped to over $7 trillion.

Some people predict $10 trillion by year-end 2020. Who knows? Jerome Powell is pushing for fiscal stimulus and claims his operation has more ammunition if forced to use it. DiMartino Booth told Pal,

The Hippocratic Oath is nowhere in the Eccles building. They don’t understand Do No Harm. They don’t understand Do Nothing. They can’t. And the market and market participants, they need to know that the Fed is doing something, because if they don’t, they’re just staring at a pile of insolvent crap. So they have to know that there is something being done on behalf of them. And the reason that every Fed official has been begging for stimulus spending is they want $3 or $4 trillion of new product out there to buy and continue to aggressively grow the balance sheet.

To put it simply, the Fed needs more bond issuance to buy.

As it is now, the Treasury issues, primary dealers buy, and then the Fed buys what the rest of the market doesn’t. There is talk to take the primary dealers out of the equation, as DiMartino Booth said,

Even if they don’t reopen the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 to allow the Fed to buy Treasuries at auction, which would require the law to change, what difference does it make if—and you see, you see the ticks flow. You see foreign investors stepping back from our Treasury market, meaning the Fed had to step in. So if the Fed is effectively absorbing Treasury issuance, why wouldn’t you call it monetization by any other name, if it’s de facto?

Felix Zulauf, owner and president of Zulauf Asset Management, told Grant Williams and Peter Fleckenstein on The End Game podcast that the government can’t absorb higher rates. He said the world’s central banks must take whatever paper governments issue. The result by the end of the decade will be a Federal Reserve balance sheet totaling $40 to $50 trillion. Williams and Fleckenstein audibly gasped upon hearing Zulauf say this.

Once the world’s central banks reach their limit, Zuluaf believes sovereign interest rates will be capped and pension plans and individual retirement accounts will be forced to buy the paper.

Negative rates will continue in Europe, leading to a nationalization of the banks. The same will happen in the US, with real interest rates being negative for years to come. Negative rates punish banks, Zulauf said.

Today’s social unrest doesn’t surprise Zulauf given the central bank policies which have led to the huge divide between the haves and have-nots. He sees the US as the worst in this regard along with Brazil. The result is “the zeitgeist is turning left.”

Trump is a populist/socialist who speaks to the right wing, according to Zulauf. He believes Joe Biden would work better with the European socialists.

This splintering will lead to more nations being formed in the next twenty years, and even California, with the fifth-largest economy in the world, may break away.

This is an investment scenario like we’ve never seen. Good luck and be careful.",10/30/20 15:58,
Economist Raises Alarm Over Inflation,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

The mainstream isn’t worried about inflation. In fact, we’re told inflation is muted.

And that’s true, at least by some measures. We haven’t seen the rising consumer price index (CPI) you might expect as central banks inject trillions of dollars created out of thin air into the economy.

But just because government numbers don’t reflect it – yet – that doesn’t mean there isn’t inflation. In fact, defined correctly, increasing the money supply is inflation. And we certainly have plenty of that.

The fact is inflation is here and it will almost certainly find its way to consumer prices eventually.

Peter Schiff has been saying that we can’t avoid the inflationary impact of money printing forever. During an interview on RT last month, he said that ultimately the price of everything is going up “because the value of the dollar, the money that people are using to buy things is going down. So, everybody is going to need a lot more dollars to buy the stuff that they need.”

In a recent interview with Kitco News, Degussa chief economist Thorsten Polleit agreed with Peter, saying people should be concerned about inflation because it’s a major threat looming on the horizon.

The Federal Reserve was already increasing the money supply before the pandemic, but the response to COVID-19 has put money printing into overdrive. As governments locked down the economy in response to coronavirus, the Fed launched what many have called “QE infinity,” and has increased the money supply at a record pace. But the Federal Reserve isn’t alone. According to a recent IMF report, central banks worldwide have injected $12 trillion into the global economy.

Meanwhile, people are asking “where is the inflation?” Polleit said it’s there. You just have to look for it.

You just have to look at equity markets, real estate and bond prices. At the moment inflation is impacting asset markets. But the increase in the quantity of money that has been printed in the US as well in the Euro area inflation will sooner or later also push up consumer prices. It may take a while for inflation in asset markets to show up in consumer prices, but it will eventually happen.”

Most people reflexively agree that money printing and stimulus are necessary to deal with the economic impacts of the pandemic, but Polleit reminds us that printing money doesn’t create wealth. It merely debases the currency and erodes our purchasing power.

Money is just a means of exchange. The wealth of a nation comes from the products it produces, the apples it grows and the homes that it builds. More money doesn’t make a nation wealthier.”

With the economy mired in a recession, millions out of work and many governments still keeping the clamps on their economies, products aren’t being produced and services aren’t being rendered. “Right now there is very little production so very little wealth is being created,” Polleit said.

But inflation isn’t bad for everybody, at least not in the short-run. Wealthy investors with big portfolios see their wealth grow thanks to asset inflation. The stimulus and money printing have blown up a massive stock market bubble. Real estate prices have also spiked. But your average consumer doesn’t reap the benefits of asset inflation. Instead, they watch their purchasing power erode. As Polleit put it, “Inflation benefits some at the expense of others.”

As the quantity of money rises, it has various effects, but eventually, it will make the great majority of people poorer.”

So, how can we mitigate the pernicious effects of inflation? Polleit said own gold. After all, the yellow metal has thousands of years of history as a store of value.

Holding gold is the best way of getting a risk reduction and return enhancement in your portfolio. Holding gold, especially at current prices, is a wise thing to do.”

Iconic NYC Barbershop Closes After 73 Years in Business Due to Lockdown,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Astor Place Hairstylists is closing down after 73 years of doing business in the East Village.

The iconic hair salon has become the latest victim of both the coronavirus pandemic and the draconian shutdown measures that New York City has had to endure for months.

The shop has counted people like Robert de Niro, Kevin Bacon and Andy Warhol has clients over the years, according to the New York Post. But now, the shop is closing for good just before Thanksgiving.

Michael Saviello, the shop’s manager, told The Post: “We’re down 90% of our business. We’ve been open every day since reopening in June, but we’ve reduced our hours.”

The decision affected 40 stylists that work at the shop, including one named “Big Mike” who has been working at the shop for over 40 years. He said: “A lot of people cried when we told them the news. Some of our customers cried because they came here as kids and now bring their kids to get their hair cut.”

The shop has been owned by the same family for three generations and its message has always been diversity, embracing the idea that people from all different economic backgrounds still need haircuts. A sign near the door informs customers of the many languages the staff speaks.

“Maybe we’ll come back when the city comes back, but right now it’s not feasible,” Saviello concluded.

Unfortunately, for as long as De Blasio stays in office, we’re not sure the city has any chance of “coming back.”",10/27/20 9:55,
Anti-lockdown demonstrations intensify around Europe,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Anti-lockdown demonstrations intensified around Europe on Saturday night as protesters in Rome hurled Molotov cocktails, bottles and rocks at police and there were also rising tensions in Barcelona and Dresden.

Early Saturday evening in Rome, a sit-in at the famed Campo dei Fiori ended in a clash with police as some in a crowd of a few hundred protesters began throwing bottles and firecrackers, before being dispersed by police with riot gear and truncheons.

Protesters also wielded banners, flares and the Italian flag before clashes with police saw one officer fall to the floor as others charged at demonstrators.

In Barcelona, in Spain, protesters pelted police with rocks and other projectiles in what was a second night of disturbances in Spain’s second-largest city. Small fires also broke out as demonstrators set fire to wooden pallets.

There were also clashes in capital Madrid, along with the northern city of Logroño, where 150 people attacked police with stones, set fire to containers and looted shops, according to officers.

Although not as ill-tempered as elsewhere, there were also protests in the German city of Dresden organised by anti-lockdown group Querdenken 571.

The protests, which were a repeat of similar scenes in the past few days came in the context of new national lockdown measures across Europe in response to rising numbers of coronavirus cases and infections.

“We Are At War”: French Official Warns Country Must Brace For More Islamist Terror Attacks,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

For the second time in October, France has been hit with grisly knife attacks, forcing government officials to warn that more of these terror fueled incidents by “Islamist ideology” are coming.

The latest attack occurred in the French city of Nice on Thursday. Three people were stabbed to death at a church. While an investigation is underway, French President Emmanuel Macron was quick to say the French people are under attack by “Islamist and terrorist madness.”

Thursday’s killings follow the gruesome beheading of schoolteacher Samuel Paty in a northern Paris suburb earlier this month. A Chechen refugee beheaded Paty after he showed his students cartoons of prophet Muhammad in a freedom of expression lesson.

Besides Macron’s warning, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told RTL radio on Friday, quoted by RT News, that the country must be prepared for future attacks as it battles Islamic extremism.

“We are in a war against an enemy that is both inside and outside. We need to understand that there have been and there will be other events such as these terrible attacks,” Darmanin said on RTL radio.

Video: “France is at war. We are at war with an enemy outside and inside. We are at war with the Islamist ideology,” he said on RTL radio.

“The greatness of our democracy, its strength, lies in being able to tell the French that within a legal framework, we can defeat the greatest barbarities. Islamism is a form of 21st-century fascism, extremism that we must fight,” he said on RTL radio.

La grandeur de notre démocratie, sa force, c’est de pouvoir dire aux Français que dans un cadre légal, on peut battre les plus grandes barbaries.

The government raised the terror threat to the highest “emergency” level late this week. Soldiers have been deployed to schools and churches across the country. This also comes as Macron declared a second national lockdown Friday until at least the end of November due to rising coronavirus cases.

UK prime minister Boris Johnson said the Nice incident on Thursday was a “barbaric attack:”

“Our thoughts are with the victims and their families, and the UK stands steadfastly with France against terror and intolerance,” said Johnson.

President Trump said, “America stands with our oldest ally in this fight.” Pope Francis said he prays for the victims, for their families, and for France.

Turkey, which is embroiled in a diplomatic spat with France over the publication of cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, said they “strongly condemn the attack at the church in Nice.”

While 79% of French people believe Islamists have “declared war” on their country, this could drum up support for nationalist political leaders in the country who have had a tough stance on combating Islamic extremism – such as Marine Le Pen.

Responding to the beheading of a school teacher by an Islamist in Paris, French ambassador to Sweden Etienne de Gonneville told broadcaster SVT, “France is a Muslim country.”",10/31/20 11:09,
Joe Rogan Debunks Claims He Spread ‘Anti-Vaxxer’ Conspiracy Theories,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Joe Rogan responded to criticism that he was spreading “anti-covid vaccine conspiracy theories” during his podcast with Alex Jones by posting a CBS News clip in which Bill Gates admitted that in one COVID vaccine trial, 80% of participants suffered side-effects.

Following a failed outrage campaign to have Rogan’s podcast with Jones deplatformed altogether, critics then turned to the content itself, accusing Rogan of facilitating dangerous conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines.

Their specific gripe centered on Jones’ claim that a coronavirus vaccine trial left 80% of participants with side-effects.

“I knew people were going to criticize the content of the podcast without even listening and I was right,” said Rogan on his Instagram page.

“That’s why I fact checked every single crazy thing he said, and all of them were verified. People have said he spread “anti-covid vaccine conspiracy theories” because he said that 80% of the people who were given one of the vaccines got sick. Here’s the video of Bill Gates admitting it himself.”

Rogan posted a video of Bill Gates appearing on CBS News, during which the host explained how at least 80% of participants in a coronavirus vaccine trial experienced a “systemic side effect ranging from severe chills to fevers.”

Gates was then asked, “Are these vaccines safe?” to which he countered that the side effects were not “super severe”.

The host then emphasized that “everybody with a high dose had a side effect,” to which Gates responded, “Yeah but some of that is not dramatic, where you know it’s just super painful.”

“Now, I’m NOT anti vaccine, and if a safe and effective covid vaccine is created I’ll take it and encourage others to take it, but I wanted to put this video up to validate what he said,” wrote Rogan.

“He said a lot of crazy, but accurate things, and that’s what I’ve been saying about him for years. He’s most certainly fucked up in the past, but this episode and the subjects he exposed highlight why I chose to have him on.”

Health Expert: Mask Wearing Will Remain Mandatory Even After a COVID Vaccine,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

A top doctor who served as an expert witness for the U.S. Congress says that even after a COVID-19 vaccine is available, mask wearing and other social distancing measures will remain mandatory.

“I feel like there is this perception that once we have a #CoronavirusVaccine life will go back to normal,” tweeted Dr.Krutika Kuppalli.

“Life will not be like it was pre-COVID. Even after we have a #vaccine you will still need to use good hand hygiene, maintain physical distance, avoid crowds and wear masks,” she added.

I feel like there is this perception that once we have a #CoronavirusVaccine life will go back to normal. Life will not be like it was pre-COVID. Even after we have a #vaccine you will still need to use good hand hygiene, maintain physical distance, avoid crowds and wear masks — Dr.Krutika Kuppalli (@KrutikaKuppalli) October 24, 2020

As we have repeatedly highlighted, despite the original lockdown and social distancing rules being introduced on the basis of ‘getting back to normal’, we’re now being told life will never return to normal.

In a CNN article written by their international security editor Nick Paton Walsh, the author asserted that the mandatory wearing of masks will become “permanent,” “just part of life,” and that the public would need to “come to terms with it.”

Earlier this month, a senior U.S. Army official said that there’ll probably never be a return to “normal” post-COVID and that rules such as social distancing and mask wearing will likely become permanent.

Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates also warned that the world won’t return to normal until there is widespread take up of a second coronavirus vaccine and that this could take years.

The idea that life will never return to pre-corona normality is also being pushed by globalist bodies like the World Economic Forum, which has promoted the necessity of exploiting the pandemic to implement a “great reset.”

Why people should be prevented from buying bedding products during a coronavirus lockdown is anyone’s guess, but it’s par for the course given how much society has been deformed thanks to such petty restrictions.

As we previously highlighted, during the first lockdown back in April, a police force in the UK threatened to start searching people’s shopping baskets in order to catch coronavirus lockdown violators.

Northamptonshire Police chief constable Nick Adderley prompted outrage after he appeared in a video to warn people who were buying unessential items at grocery stores that their purchases may be scrutinized by the authorities.

“We will not at this stage be starting to marshal supermarkets and checking the items in baskets and trolleys to see whether it’s a legitimate, necessary item but again be under no illusion, if people do not heed the warnings and the pleas that I’m making today, we will start to do that,” said Adderley.

In the same month, one shopper was fined by police for buying wine and potato chips, which were deemed to be “non-essential” items.

Residents of Wales are currently under a ‘Tier 3’ lockdown, which means people are being urged to stay at home, must not visit other households, while pubs, restaurants, gyms, churches and shops deemed “non-essential” are all closed.

EU Chief Warns Europe Facing “Long Coronavirus Pandemic”,"Looking determinedly into the camera, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a virtual press conference from Belgium — which currently has the highest infection rate in the European Union — that the coronavirus pandemic remains “very serious.”

“We are deeply into the second wave,” said von der Leyen, who is a medical doctor with a background in public health and epidemiology. “And, this time, we face two enemies: the coronavirus and a growing COVID-19 fatigue.” She warned that it would be months at least before the first vaccines were available.

“We cannot let down our guard now,” von der Leyen said. “The situation is very, very serious, but we can slow down the spread of the virus if everyone takes responsibility.” She said that meant “every single one of us, regional and local communities, member states and the European level.”

Von der Leyen also called for better coordination between member states on strategies and measures to curb the spread of the virus, as well as for coordinated quarantine rules. The Commission recommends an EU register of hospital capacity to better organize cross-border patient care. Moreover, though member states have been asked to share COVID-19 data with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, this has not been happening as much as hoped for. The Commission has encouraged member states to agree on standards for travel and contact tracing.

‘Deaths are rising’

The Commission, which is negotiating with pharma companies to purchase hundreds of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines to distribute across the 27 member states of the European Union, has called on EU governments to draw up national vaccination strategies. “There are many issues to be considered for an effective vaccine deployment,” von der Leyen said. “But on one thing I will be very clear,” she added. “We will not compromise on the safety of vaccines.”

The Belgian microbiologist Peter Piot, the former executive director of UNAIDS and one of the scientists who identified Ebola, attended the press conference as a special adviser on COVID-19 to the president of the European Commission. He said 11 vaccines were currently in clinical trials, but he said that there would be no magic elixir.

Piot said it would take a long time before the population achieved sufficient immunity, adding that he was very concerned by polls that suggested that 25% of the EU population might refuse a vaccine. He said he understood that people were suffering from COVID-19 fatigue and were reluctant to follow the guidelines. However, he said, about 60% of people across the EU were wearing masks: Hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved if that rose to 95%.

“Deaths are rising also,” Piot said. “Last week about one-third more deaths than the week before, which means that about 1,000 Europeans die per day from COVID.”

Piot, who contracted the coronavirus at the beginning of the pandemic and suffered from complete exhaustion for months, said he knew what he was talking about. He said he was more optimistic now that that hospital treatment seems to be more effective than it had been at the beginning of the pandemic.

Tough times ahead

At a video summit hosted by European Council President Charles Michel on Thursday, EU heads of state and government will discuss the current situation. Michel said the European Union should conduct more rapid testing for travelers, careworkers and elderly people in care homes. The European Commission has put aside €100 million ($117.5 million) to buy rapid tests, and Michel has said member states should not have to compete for access.

Von der Leyen seemed a little perturbed by a question about why the European Union’s strategy so far had not succeeded. But then she admitted that perhaps member states had been “too fast” to ease certain measures in the summer that had been put in place to curb the spread of the virus. She also pointed out that though hospitals were better equipped than in spring, medical staff were “exhausted,” and it was no surprise that Europe was now witnessing a second wave, which might not even be the last.

The European Commission president concluded on a somber note, saying the cancellation of holiday markets, restricted travel and limited socializing would make for a tough winter. “

“I think this year’s Christmas will be a different Christmas,” von der Leyen said.",10/29/20 7:27,
"UK Police Chief Warns Lockdown Could Spark Riots, Civil Unrest","Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

A police chief in the UK has warned that lockdown is a “time bomb” that could eventually explode into riots and mass civil unrest.

The United Kingdom has placed its citizens under different ‘tiers’ of lockdowns depending where they are in the country, although anecdotal evidence suggests there is now mass non-compliance with the rules.

This could force authorities to become more draconian in enforcing the measures, which could in turn spark a violent backlash.

According to West Midlands commissioner David Jamieson, “We’re sitting on a time bomb here.”

“We’re getting very near the stage where you could see a considerable explosion of frustration and energy,” he added.

“Things are very on the edge in a lot of communities and it wouldn’t take very much to spark off unrest, riots, damage,” warned Jamieson.

The comments were made off the back of another warning – that people who violated the rules by organizing family Christmas gatherings could see their celebrations broken up by police.

The West Midlands is currently under a Tier 2 lockdown, which means that it’s illegal for two separate households to mix indoors, ruining Christmas for many families or at least those who choose to abide by the rules.

The prospect of video footage showing police officers entering homes to break up Christmas family gatherings is only likely to turn the public further against the lockdown, which was introduced under the guise of “getting back to normal” but has now become the new normal.

Whitmer Orders Restaurants Take Names of Customers For Contact Tracing Or Face Fines & Jail Time,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer’s administration has set forth new tyrannical coronavirus mitigation orders requiring restaurants and bars take down names of its customers “to aid in contact tracing and case investigation efforts.”

Michigan Department of Health and Human Services unveiled the order last week, stating that the new mandate would take effect on Monday.

“All dine-in food service establishments must maintain accurate records of the names and phone numbers of patrons who purchase food for consumption on the premises, and the date and time of entry,” the order reads.

Failure to follow these new orders is punishable by a fine of up to $1000 and up to six months in jail.

“While continuing to focus on encouraging voluntary compliance with its Emergency Orders, MDHHS has also issued rules that set forth fines for violations of these epidemic orders. Violations are punishable by a civil fine up to $1,000 and may also be treated as a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than six months or a fine of not more than $200, or both,” the order states.

Additionally, the department’s new orders also reduce the maximum gathering size for indoor gatherings, such as weddings, parties and banquets from from 500 people to 50 people — just in time for Thanksgiving.

Though the daily death rate has remained low since June, Whiter is using the increase in general cases as the pretext to implement this tyrannical contact tracing agenda.

Notably, the ACLU had stated in May that government contact tracing schemes are a risk “to people’s fundamental rights to privacy and association.”

This over-the-top government order is par for the course for Whitmer and Michigan.

Last month, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that Whitmer’s draconian lockdown orders were unconstitutional.

“The liberties protected by the Constitution are not fair-weather freedoms — in place when times are good but able to be cast aside in times of trouble,” U.S. District Judge William Stickman wrote.

Whitmer’s administration is encouraging residents to report such violations of this order and report non-mask wearers to police.

"Fauci Praises Biden, Knocks Trump Over Coronavirus Approach — WH Slams For “Playing Politics”","Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci praised Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden and criticized President Trump over their coronavirus response plans just days before the election.

Fauci told The Washington Post on Friday that America will experience “a lot of hurt” in the coming winter months due to a second wave of the pandemic.

“We’re in for a whole lot of hurt. It’s not a good situation,” Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said. “All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.”

But Fauci went on to suggest that Trump is to blame for a coming second wave and that Biden is “taking it seriously.”

From The Washington Post:

Asked about the difference between their approaches, Fauci said Biden’s campaign “is taking it seriously from a public health perspective.” Trump, Fauci said, is “looking at it from a different perspective.” He said that perspective was “the economy and reopening the country.”

The White House hit back at Fauci’s political grandstanding, saying that Fauci “making his political leanings known” just days before the election is indicative of “Swamp” behavior.

“It’s unacceptable and breaking with all norms for Dr. Fauci, a senior member of the President’s Coronavirus Task Force and someone who has praised President Trump’s actions throughout this pandemic, to choose three days before an election to play politics,” said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere.

“As a member of the Task Force, Dr. Fauci has a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy, but he’s not done that, instead choosing to criticize the President in the media and make his political leanings known by praising the President’s opponent — exactly what the American people have come to expect from The Swamp.”

“Dr. Fauci may have just admitted that he is afraid the cure will be worse than the disease and that unlike the president he has no confidence in the American people to make the best choice for themselves armed with CDC best practices,” Deere concluded

Operation Coronavirus Is Working Hand-in-Hand With The Nanotech Agenda,"Reddit Email WhatsApp More 20 Shares

The nanotech agenda – involving the placement of tiny sensors, devices and machines measured in nanometers inside the human body – is receiving a boost from the current fake pandemic which I have labeled Operation Coronavirus.

My earlier article Hydrogel Biosensor: Implantable Nanotech to be Used in COVID Vaccines? discussed the possibility that the coming COVID vaccines may incorporate nanotechnology funded by DARPA called hydrogel, a biosensor which would monitor your body as well as send and receive information to the 5G Smart Grid.

However there is much, much more to the story.

The NWO conspirators have not only been planning this scamdemic for decades but also have been planning the nanotech agenda for a long time too; now, with the advent of COVID, the two agendas are merging, with sinister implications for humanity.

This article will take a closer look at the nanotech agenda and the current state of nanotechnology inside existing products such as vaccines. The agenda is already far more advanced than many people realize.

2008 Paper Outlines Plan To Construct A Nanorobot Hardware Architecture

A 2008 research paper entitled Nanorobot Hardware Architecture for Medical Defense analyzes in fine detail how nanotech devices such as nanorobots could be used to for various purposes such as “medical defense” and “epidemic control.”

It states that it provides details on an “integrated platform and hardware architecture for nanorobots application in epidemic control, which should enable real time in vivo prognosis of biohazard infection.”

The idea is to place nanotech inside our bodies which communicates in real time with the Smart Grid (powered by 5G) to provide intimate information to the authorities about us. Wayne from Alchemical Tech Revolution does a great commentary here. Following are some quotes from the paper:

“Normally, for areas in public calamity or conflict zones, the absence of drinking water, any sort of fuel, electricity, and the lack of towers for network communication, including cable and wireless telephony, is a constant.

“In such a situation, the available infrastructure is far from ideal to enable a large scale medical laboratory with precise and fast analysis. For such aspect, nanorobots integrated with nanobiosensors can help to transmit real time information, using international mobile phones for wireless data transmission through satellite communication.

“In fact, nanorobots should mean an efficient and powerful clinical device to provide precious biomedical monitoring, both for soldiers as for civilian population.”

Notice how they admit that there is dual use (for military and civilians) which usually connotes a weapons system with another use. In this case, they are disguising the deeper purpose (embedded surveillance) with the superficial purpose (a medical application):

“Taking from the moment of infection, some contagious diseases may show the first symptoms after hours, a week, or longer time, like years or even decades. It means, for example, that when the public authorities noticed the infection from a contaminated person, showing external symptoms, a virus had enough time to spread itself through a circle of friends and workmates of the infected victim.

“Meantime, those mates were adversely driving the virus forward, and had started a catastrophic chain circle. The use of nanorobots with embedded nanodevices for real time epidemic control, as lab on a chip, can be useful to avoid serious contamination with large proportions.”

The above quote hypes the danger of contagion, and specifically a virus, as a reason for you to willingly submit to the nanotech agenda and get embedded with nanotechnology.

It appeals to the concepts of contagion and germ theory, however especially since the COVID scamdemic began, a number of brave independent researchers and doctors are questioning these ideas, which reinforce the current Medical Industry’s business model of petrochemical pills and vaccines.

“We implemented a system simulation and architecture of nanorobots for sensing the bloodstream, targeting biochemical changes against pathological signals.

“Actual advances in wireless technologies, nanoelectronics devices, and their use in the implementation of nanorobots applied to epidemic control, illustrate what upcoming technologies can enable in terms of real time health monitoring. The approach for in vivo monitoring chemical concentrations should also apply to other.”

As Wayne says, this stuff is next level contact tracing. Forget an app on your phone; the plan is for in vivo (taking place in a living organism) surveillance. There are many significant quotes from the paper, but here is one last one:

“Frequencies ranging from 1 to 20MHz can be successfully used for biomedical applications without any damage.”

Is the implication that there could be damage if frequencies are higher than 20MHz, such as in the 30-100 GHz range of 5G?

2017 Study Shows Nanotech Contaminants Already Widely Present In Vaccines

The nanotech invasion is already here. It’s not a question of “will they place nanotech in vaccines” since they already have.

This 2017 Italian study entitled New Quality-Control Investigations on Vaccines: Micro- and Nanocontamination details an astonishing array of nanocontaminants in vaccines, including particles made of lead, cadmium, cerium, iron, titanium, nickel, zirconium, hafnium, strontium, tungsten, gold, silver, platinum, antimony, bismuth and aluminum.

The study (which analyzes 44 types of 15 traditional vaccines) states that these contaminants are “non biodegradable and non biocompatible”, that their inclusion is “not declared” and that their presence is “inexplicable.”

It gives the benefit of the doubt to Big Pharma and its controllers when it concludes that “our hypothesis is that this contamination is unintentional, since it is probably due to polluted components or procedures of industrial processes (e.g. filtrations) used to produce vaccines, not investigated and not detected by the Producers. If our hypothesis is actually the case, a close inspection of the working places and the full knowledge of the whole procedure of vaccine preparation would probably allow to eliminate the problem.”

Knowing the background of the human microchipping and nanotech agenda, I would suggest there is another way to see things.

The study reveals how these nanoparticles can interact with the body in negative ways and cause harmful effects:

“… investigations revealed that some particles are embedded in a biological substrate, probably proteins, endo-toxins and residues of bacteria. As soon as a particle comes in contact with proteic fluids, a nano-bio-interaction occurs and a “protein corona” is formed.

“The nano-bio-interaction generates a bigger-sized compound that is not biodegradable and can induce adverse effects, since it is not recognized as self by the body. Figure 5a-5f show examples of these nano-bio-interactions. Aggregates can be seen (stable composite entities) containing particles of Lead in Meningitec, of stainless steel (Iron, Chromium and Nickel) and of Copper, Zinc and Lead in Cervarix.”

“After being injected, those microparticles, nanoparticles and aggregates can stay around the injection site forming swellings and granulomas … But they can also be carried by the blood circulation, escaping any attempt to guess what will be their final destination … As happens with all foreign bodies, particularly that small, they induce an inflammatory reaction that is chronic because most of those particles cannot be degraded.

“Furthermore, the protein-corona effect … due to a nano-bio-interaction … can produce organic/inorganic composite particles capable of stimulating the immune system in an undesirable way … It is impossible not to add that particles the size often observed in vaccines can enter cell nuclei and interact with the DNA …”

“In some cases, e.g. as occurs with Iron and some Iron alloys, they can corrode and the corrosion products exert a toxicity affecting the tissues …”

So here is the question to ponder: are these so-called accidental and dangerous nanocontaminants just particles that deleteriously affect human health in numerous ways, or are they also nanosensors that can receive and transmit data to the Smart Grid?

Nanotechnology Is At The Forefront Of Cutting-Edge Vaccine Research

The nanotech agenda is closely connected to vaccines. For example, this 2019 study Nanoparticle-Based Vaccines Against Respiratory Viruses touts the advantages of nanotech vaccines:

“Conventional vaccines based on live-attenuated pathogens present a risk of reversion to pathogenic virulence while inactivated pathogen vaccines often lead to a weak immune response. Subunit vaccines were developed to overcome these issues.

“However, these vaccines may suffer from a limited immunogenicity and, in most cases, the protection induced is only partial. A new generation of vaccines based on nanoparticles has shown great potential to address most of the limitations of conventional and subunit vaccines.

“This is due to recent advances in chemical and biological engineering, which allow the design of nanoparticles with a precise control over the size, shape, functionality and surface properties, leading to enhanced antigen presentation and strong immunogenicity.”

This July 2020 study COVID-19 vaccine development and a potential nanomaterial path forward explains how there are many nanotech platforms that will be included in future vaccines:

“Nanotechnology-based approaches offer enabling solutions to the delivery challenge by trafficking the vaccine to appropriate cellular populations and subcellular locations …

“Moderna’s mRNA vaccine is based on a lipid nanoparticle platform, but there are many other emerging nanotechnologies for delivery of nucleic acid vaccines … Nanotechnology platforms including cationic nanoemulsions, liposomes, dendrimers or polysaccharide particles have been employed for improving the stability and delivery of mRNA based vaccines.”

The coming Moderna COVID vaccine funded by NWO frontman and eugenics Bill Gates is a new type of technology: an mRNA vaccine that uses nanotechnology. This goes for other COVID vaccines that are being developed.

The COVID plandemic is being used as a pretext to rush forward even faster with nanotech vaccines, which ultimately accelerates the central NWO (New World Order) scheme: the human microchipping agenda. The nanotech agenda via COVID is on full display:

“Nanomaterials play an important role in all aspects of vaccine design, delivery and administration. Nanoparticles enable multivalent antigen presentation and stabilization of antigens upon administration, they can serve as adjuvants to boost the immune response, and they can act as carriers for the targeted delivery of antigens.

“Indeed, an mRNA vaccine delivered by a liposomal nanoparticle is amongst the candidates currently in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2. While it remains a fact that no mRNA or DNA vaccine is currently approved for any disease, the delivery of nucleic acids requires some form of modification or a nanodevice to prevent degradation in the body, and liposomal devices have indeed already been approved for RNA delivery, albeit not yet for vaccines.”

Final Thoughts On The Accelerating Nanotech Agenda

This is it! It’s game on! All the things that many alternative researchers have been writing, talking and warning about for years are arriving. Operation Coronavirus is the gateway to bring in the New World Order. COVID has been the excuse offered by tyrants for just about every draconian restriction under the sun.

Now, with the coming COVID vaccine, we know it will include some kind of nanotechnology, since as I have outlined above, there are a plethora of nanotechnology platforms being developed in addition to things like hydrogel. Various studies and the pharmaceutical companies themselves are openly stating that there will be nanotech COVID vaccines.

With plans to make this vaccine widepsread, administed by the military (as admitted in both the US and the UK) and “as mandatory as possible” (according to Aussie PM Scott Morrison), time is running out for people to wake up to the nanotech agenda – before it’s too late.

The Global Takeover Is Underway,"Reddit Email WhatsApp More 86 Shares

The World Economic Forum public relations video above, “8 Predictions for the World in 2030,” short as it may be, offers a telling glimpse into what the technocratic elite has in store for the rest of us. This includes:

“You’ll own nothing” — And “you’ll be happy about it.” Instead, you’ll rent everything you need, and it’ll be delivered by drone right to your door. “The U.S. won’t be the world’s leading superpower” — Instead, a handful of countries will dominate together. “You won’t die waiting for an organ donor” — Rather than transplanting organs from deceased donors, custom organs will be 3D printed on demand. “You’ll eat much less meat” — Meat will be “an occasional treat, not a staple, for the good of the environment and our health.”As detailed in many previous articles, this is a foolhardy idea, not just for health reasons but also environmental ones. Integrating livestock is a foundational aspect of successful regenerative farming that can solve both food shortages and environmental concerns at the same time. “A billion people will be displaced by climate change” — As a result, countries will have to prepare to welcome more refugees. “Polluters will have to pay to emit carbon dioxide” — To eliminate fossil fuels, there will be a global price on carbon. Vandana Shiva, Ph.D., discussed this in a recent interview. Rather than promoting organic and regenerative farming, the technocratic elite are pushing something called zero-budget natural farming. Bill Gates is part of this scheme.As explained by Shiva, the wholly unnatural setup works something like this: The state takes out large loans, which are then divvied out to farmers to grow food for free. The farmers make their money not by selling their crops, but by trading their soil carbon rate on the global market.Basically, carbon is being turned into a tradeable commodity, replacing the actual farm output of grains and other crops. Farmers with higher carbon in their soil will make more money than those with carbon-poor soil. Meanwhile, they’ll make nothing from the crops they grow. “You could be preparing to go to Mars” — Scientists “will have worked out how to keep you healthy in space,” thus opening up the possibility of becoming a space-faring race and colonizing other planets. “Western values will have been tested to the breaking point.”

Pandemics Are a Tool of Social Control

For decades, war and the threat of war has enriched the technocratic elite and kept the population going along with their agenda. War and physical attacks have been repeatedly used to foist ever more draconian restrictions upon us and remove our liberties. The Patriot Act, rammed through in the aftermath of 9/11, is just one egregious example.

Today, pandemics and the threat of infectious outbreaks are the new tools of war and social control. For years, Gates has prepared the global psyche for a new enemy: deadly, invisible viruses that can crop up at any time.1,2 And the only way to protect ourselves is by giving up old-fashioned notions of privacy, liberty and personal decision-making.

We need to maintain our distance from others, including family members. We need to wear masks, even in our own homes and during sex. We need to close down small businesses and work from home. We need to vaccinate the entire global population and put stringent travel restrictions into place to prevent the potential for spread.

We must track and trace everyone, every moment of the day and night, and install biometric readers into everyone’s bodies to identify who the potential risk-carriers are. Infected people are the new threat. This is what the technocratic elite wants you to believe, and they’ve succeeded to convince a shocking ratio of the global population of this in just a few short months.

If you’re unfamiliar with the term “technocracy,” be sure to go back and listen to my interview with Patrick Wood, author of “Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation” and “Technocracy: The Hard Road to World Order.”

A New Digital Currency System Underway

Two of the last pieces of the totalitarian takeover will be the transition to an all-digital currency linked to digital IDs. With that, enforcement of social rules will be more or less ensured, as your finances, indeed your entire identity, can easily be held hostage if you fail to comply.

Just think how easy it would be to automate it such that if you fail to get your mandated vaccine, or post something undesirable on the internet, your bank account becomes unavailable or your biometric ID won’t allow you entry into your office building.

An August 13, 2020, article3 on the Federal Reserve website discusses the supposed benefits of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). There’s general agreement among experts that most major countries will implement CBDC within the next two to four years.

An all-digital currency system also plays into social engineering, as it can be used to incentivize desired behaviors, very similar to what China is doing with their social credit system. For example, you might get a certain amount of digital currency but you have to buy a certain item or perform a particular task within a certain timeframe.

Many uninformed people will believe that these new CBDCs will be very similar to existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but they would be seriously mistaken. Bitcoin is decentralized and a rational strategy to opt out of the existing central bank controlled system, while these CBDCs will be centralized and completely controlled by the central banks.

If you have been intrigued about investing in Bitcoin as a safer alternative to the stock market, but just didn’t know how or understand the process, the video below is an excellent introduction on how to do this safely without losing your funds. My favorite crypto exchange is Kraken, which has far lower fees than Coinbase.

The Globalists

While I mention Gates a lot, he’s not acting alone, of course. It just so happens that as you trace the connections between the decision-makers of the world, you’ll find him in an astonishing number of places.

For example, In October 2019, Gates co-hosted a pandemic preparedness simulation for a “novel coronavirus,” known as Event 201, along with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the World Economic Forum.

The event eerily predicted what would happen just 10 weeks later, when COVID-19 appeared. Gates and the World Economic Forum, in turn, are both partnered4 with the United Nations which, while keeping a relatively low profile, appears to be at the heart of the globalist takeover agenda.

Gates is also the largest funder of the World Health Organization — the medical branch of the U.N., while the World Economic Forum is the social and economic branch of the U.N. Other key partners that play important roles in the implementation of the globalists agenda include:5

Foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Ford Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, the UN Foundation and George Soros’ Open Society Foundation Avanti Communications, a British provider of satellite technology with global connectivity 2030 Vision, a partnership of technology giants to provide the infrastructure and technology solutions needed to realize the U.N.’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. 2030 Vision is also partnered with Frontier 2030, which is a partnership of organizations under the helm of the World Economic Forum Google, the No. 1 Big Data collector in the world and a leader in AI services Mastercard, which is leading the globalist charge to develop digital IDs and banking services Salesforce, a global leader in cloud computing, the “internet of things” and artificial intelligence. Incidentally, Salesforce is led by Marc Benioff, who is also on the World Economic Forum’s board of directors

The Fourth Industrial Revolution Is the Technocratic Agenda

In decades past, the technocrats, the global, mostly unelected, elite that steer the management of nations worldwide, called for a “new world order.” Today, the NWO has been largely replaced with terms like “the Great Reset,”6 “the Fourth Industrial Revolution,”7 and the slogan “Build Back Better.”8

All of these terms and slogans refer to the same long-term globalist agenda to dismantle democracy and national borders in favor of a global governance by unelected leaders, and the reliance on technological surveillance rather than the rule of law to maintain public order.

As expressed by Matt Hancock, the British Minister for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, during a speech before the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Fourth Industrial Revolution in 2017:9

“One of the roles of Parliament is to cast ahead, to look to the horizon, and tackle the great challenges of our time. So, I applaud the creation of the APPG on the fourth industrial revolution, which surely is one of the greatest challenges we face, as a nation, and as a world.

The nature of the technologies is materially different to what has come before. In the past, we’ve thought of consumption as a one-off, and capital investment as additive. Yet put resources into the networks that now connect half the world, or into AI, and the effects are exponential …

I’m delighted to speak alongside so many impressive colleagues who really understand this, and alongside Professor Klaus Schwab who literally ‘wrote the book’ on the 4th Industrial Revolution. Your work, bringing together as you do all the best minds on the planet, has informed what we are doing …

Our Digital Strategy, embedded within the wider Industrial Strategy, sets out the seven pillars on which we can build our success. And inside that fits our 5G strategy, like a set of Russian Dolls.

Our Strategy covers infrastructure, skills, rules and ethics of big data use, cyber security, supporting the tech sector, the digitization of industry, and digitization of government.”

The Great Reset — A Techno-Fascist Recipe

If you listened to my interview with Wood, you will recognize the technocratic elements of Hancock’s speech: the focus on technology — in particular artificial intelligence, digital surveillance and Big Data collection (which is what 5G is for) — and the digitization of industry (which includes banking) and government, which in turn allows for the automation of social engineering and social rule (although that part is never expressly stated).

“The promised Utopia comes with a price — it sets shackles on our personal freedom.”

Then there’s the direct reference to professor Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum. Schwab is also highlighted in the June 29, 2020, Technocracy.news article,10 “The Elite Technocrats Behind the Global ‘Great Reset,” which reads, in part:11

“The UN Agenda 2030 with its Sustainable Development Goals is claimed to ‘ensure peace and prosperity for people and the planet.’ The actions are said to tackle poverty and hunger, bring better health and education, reduce inequalities, and save the oceans, forests and the climate.

Who can argue against such benevolent goals? But the promised Utopia comes with a price — it sets shackles on our personal freedom …

The leading partners of the United Nations Global Goals project reveal the real technocratic agenda that lies behind the polished feel-good façade — it involves a plan to fully integrate mankind into a technological surveillance apparatus overseen by a powerful AI.

The current pandemic scare has been a perfect trigger to kickstart this nefarious agenda … The current COVID-19 crisis is seen by the World Economic Forum and its chairman Klaus Schwab as the perfect trigger to implement their grandiose technocratic plan. Big Tech will come to ‘rescue’ the world.

In June 2020, Schwab declared … the need of a Great Reset to restore order in a world steeped in panic, conflict and economic turmoil:

‘The COVID-19 crisis has shown us that our old systems are not fit anymore for the 21st century. It has laid bare the fundamental lack of social cohesion, fairness, inclusion and equality. Now is the historical moment in time, not only to fight the real virus but to shape the system for the needs of the Post-Corona era.

We have a choice to remain passive, which would lead to the amplification of many of the trends we see today. Polarization, nationalism, racism, and ultimately increasing social unrest and conflicts.

But we have another choice, we can build a new social contract, particularly integrating the next generation, we can change our behavior to be in harmony with nature again, and we can make sure the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are best utilized to provide us with better lives.’

This techno-fascist recipe will then, in an utmost non-democratic fashion without any public debate or skeptic inquiry, soon be integrated into the agenda of G20 and the European Union — relabeled as the Great Green Deal …

Unsurprisingly, Klaus Schwab fails to mention his own and his cronies’ role in creating this global economic mess in the first place — as it was ‘foreseen’ with stunning accuracy in World Economic Forum’s and Bill Gate’s Event 201 (October 2019) and in the Rockefeller Foundation report12 Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development (2010).”

UN Calls for Nations to ‘Build Back Better’

The U.N.’s central role in the technocratic agenda is hard to miss once you start looking. As reported by the U.N.’s Department of Global Communications April 22, 2020, in an article about climate change and COVID-19:13

“As the world begins planning for a post-pandemic recovery, the United Nations is calling on Governments to seize the opportunity to ‘build back better’ by creating more sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies …

‘With this restart, a window of hope and opportunity opens… an opportunity for nations to green their recovery packages and shape the 21st century economy in ways that are clean, green, healthy, safe and more resilient,’ said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa in her International Mother Earth Day message … It is therefore important that post-COVID-19 stimulus packages help the economy ‘grow back greener’ …

As Governments approve stimulus packages to support job creation, poverty reduction and economic growth, UNEP will help Member States ‘build back better,’ and capture opportunities for leap-frogging to green investments in renewable energy, smart housing, green public procurement and public transport — all guided by the principles and standards of sustainable production and consumption. These actions will be critical to fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals.”

Here too, we see the technocratic agenda shining through. As described by Wood (see interview hyperlinked above), technocracy is an economic system based on the allocation of energy resources, which necessitates social engineering to control the population and the technological infrastructure to automate this control.

Rather than being driven by supply and demand and free enterprise, this system is one in which companies are told what resources they’re allowed to use, when, and for what, and consumers are told what they are allowed to buy — or rather, rent, judging by the World Economic Forum video above.

If you need something, you’ll be allowed to rent it. You probably won’t even own the clothes on your back. Everything will be “fair” and “equitable.” There will be no need for hard work, ingenuity or higher-than-average intelligence. Everyone will be the same — with the exception of the technocrats themselves, of course. And in true social engineering fashion, they tell us we will be “happy” in our 24/7 enslavement to boot.

The Encroaching Dystopia

It’s important to realize that one way by which this globalist plan is being pushed forward is through the creation of new global laws. Gates already wields powerful influence over global food and agriculture policy, in addition to his influence over global health and technology (including banking and digital IDs).

The Great Reset, or the “build back better” plan, specifically calls for all nations to implement “green” regulations as part of the post-COVID recovery effort. It sounds like a worthwhile endeavor — after all, who doesn’t want to protect the environment?

But the end goal is far from what the typical person envisions when they hear these plans. The end goal is to turn us into serfs without rights to privacy, private ownership or anything else.

To get an idea of just how dystopian a future we might be looking at, consider Microsoft’s international patent14 WO/2020/060606 for a “cryptocurrency system using body activity data.” The international patent was filed June 20, 2019. The U.S. patent office application,15 16128518, was filed September 21, 2018. As explained in the abstract:16

“Human body activity associated with a task provided to a user may be used in a mining process of a cryptocurrency system. A server may provide a task to a device of a user which is communicatively coupled to the server. A sensor communicatively coupled to or comprised in the device of the user may sense body activity of the user.

Body activity data may be generated based on the sensed body activity of the user. The cryptocurrency system communicatively coupled to the device of the user may verify if the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.”

The U.S. patent application includes the following flow chart summary of the process:17

This patent, if implemented, would essentially turn human beings into robots. If you’ve ever wondered how the average person will make a living in the AI tech-driven world of the future, this may be part of your answer.

People will be brought down to the level of mindless drones, spending their days carrying out tasks automatically handed out by, say a cellphone app, in return for a cryptocurrency “award.” I don’t know about you, but I can think of better, more enjoyable ways to spend my time here on Earth.

The World Economic Forum — A Trojan Horse

I’ve mentioned the World Economic Forum multiple times already in this article, and it, along with the U.N., is at the heart of the global takeover agenda. As noted in the Canadian Truth blog post,18 “World Economic Forum Wheel of Evil”:

“ … this is about two things, the implementation of the UN SDG’s [Sustainable Development Goals] and the WEF [World Economic Forum] Fourth Industrial Revolution. End game: total Technocratic lock-down where they control every aspect of our lives and all resources on the planet.”

The blog post includes the following illustration, created and released by the World Economic Forum, showing the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global response to it. If you go to the original site for the illustration,19 you’ll also find listings of publications, videos and data relating to all of these facets.

In short, the pandemic is being used to destroy the local economies around the world, which will then allow the World Economic Forum to come in and “rescue” debt-ridden countries.

As mentioned earlier, the price for this salvation is your liberty. The World Economic Forum will, through its financial bailouts, be able to effectively control most countries in the world. And, again, one of the aspects of the technocratic plan is to eliminate nation borders and nationalism in general.

COVID — Symptoms of Power

There’s a lot more that could be said on this, but I’ve already covered many of the different aspects of the globalists agenda in other articles, including “COVID Symptoms of Power: Tech Billionaires Harvest Humanity,” “Tech Billionaires Aiming at a Global Currency,” “Harvard Professor Exposes Surveillance Capitalism,” “How Medical Technocracy Made the Plandemic Possible” and “US Surveillance Bill 6666: The Devil in the Details.”

None of it is pleasant reading, but it’s important to understand where we’re headed. We no longer have the luxury of sticking our heads in the sand and waiting for the bad news to pass.

The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically widened the economic gap between average people and the wealthy elite, with billionaires raking in trillions of dollars in mere months.20,21 Without the competition from small businesses, large multinational companies have been allowed to gobble up business, expanding both their wealth and their influence, while extreme poverty has risen for the first time in two decades.22

If you think the Great Reset and the Green New Deal are going to even out this financial disparity and turn the world into an equitable Utopia, you’re bound to be disappointed. The globalist plan isn’t about creating a better world for the average person. Microsoft’s patent illustrates what the plan heralds for us.

Medical Tyranny Will Get Worse if We Let It

The medical tyranny and censorship of anti-groupthink that has emerged full-force during this pandemic are also part and parcel of the Great Reset. After all, if they won’t allow you to own anything, and they want to put biosensors into your body to turn you into a cryptocurrency mining minion, do you really think they’re going to let you make medical decisions for yourself?

Over the past several months, Gates has made the media rounds discussing the need to silence dissenting views and information about the virus, it’s treatment and the vaccines being made.

According to a survey cited by RT,23 less than half of all Americans now say they would not take the COVID-19 vaccine even if they were paid $100 to do it. There are good reasons for this hesitancy, as trials are starting to reveal serious side effects.

For Gates, who is funding no fewer than six different COVID-19 vaccines, this is no small problem. In an October 2020 interview, Gates urged American health officials to start “thinking about which voices will help reduce the hesitancy, so we can get a level of vaccination that really has a chance of stopping” the pandemic.24

Despite the risks associated with these novel mRNA vaccines, which have never before been approved for human use, and despite the fact that children and adolescents have a minuscule risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19, vaccine proponents like Dr. Paul Offit are now calling for children to be added to the COVID-19 trials.25 Hopefully, the number of parents willing to offer up their children as guinea pigs will be few.

In closing, keep in mind that technocracy is inherently a technological society run through social engineering. This is why there’s such a strong focus on “science.” Anytime someone dissents, they’re therefore accused of being “anti-science,” and any science that conflicts with the status quo is declared “debunked science.”

The only science that matters is whatever the technocrats deem true. Logic, however, will tell you that this cannot be so. Science is never settled. Science is never one-sided. Science can be wrong. Getting to the truth demands that an issue be looked at from many different angles.

Over the past year in particular, scientific inquiry and inquisitiveness has been censored and stifled to an astonishing degree. If we allow it to continue, the end result will be devastating.

We must keep pushing for transparency and truth. We must insist on medical freedom and personal liberty. Do not allow yourself to be bullied into silence by those who counter your objections with “anti-science” or “conspiracy-theory” slurs. The future of mankind is at stake. Be brave. Resist tyranny.

COVID-19 Roadmap: 12 Step Plan To Create A Totalitarian New World Order,"Reddit Email WhatsApp More 124 Shares

One can step back from all the MK Ultra mind control through the propaganda of the mainstream media and lying politicians and clearly see that the CON-vid hysteria is the invisible enemy tyrants are using to push forward both the United Nations ‘Agenda 21‘ and advance toward Agenda 2030.

Below is an infographic that provides the 12 step plan of using a virtually unproven “virus” to bring about the New World Order and it’s right on schedule unless the people stop it.

Currently, we are on step 8 and moving quickly towards step 9:

After step 9, all bets are off because by that time, most small businesses will be out of business due to unlawful lockdowns and the only businesses open with be giant online corporations who are making a killing from the lockdown even now.

Already we are told there are “coin shortage” and many stores are demanding payments be card rather then cash unless you have the correct amount.

Seriously, the above roadmap seems to be right on track with what we are seeing advance our way.

It’s time the people awake from their slumber, turn off the television, quit believing the narrative of the “right/left” paradigm and start shutting down tyrants and defending liberty!

"5G Rollout Speeds Up Despite Pandemic, Governments Banning It Issuing Moratoriums & Lawsuits","Reddit Email WhatsApp More 948 Shares

Many cities, countries, and organizations have taken action against the 5G rollout including banning it, filing lawsuits and issuing moratoriums. Since 2018 people and animals have been getting sick where it has been turned on.

Worldwide opposition includes a multitude of catastrophic warnings in addition to health risks from exposure which include reduced immunity to illness and cancer.

Even though the coronavirus pandemic has literally caused countries to shut themselves down – this hasn’t stopped the “Race to 5G”. In fact – the pandemic is actually accelerating it.

Thanks to Technocracy News & Trends for providing explanation why:

5G carriers claim that the coronavirus pandemic has actually increased demand for wireless bandwidth and thus make it ever more important to quickly rollout 5G towers around the nation to increase wireless capacity. – TN Editor

In March 2020 everything that could be moved online already has, from elementary schools to college classes, from entire company workforces to shareholder meetings. Whole cities have emptied under the coronavirus threat as businesses tell employees to work from home, students are sent indoors to learn online and every type of entertainment — from restaurants and sporting venues to movie theaters — shutters, forcing people to stay home and rely on their home broadband networks to interact with the outside world.

Small mobile antenna on concrete pole.

This switch-over is unprecedented, which begs the question: Can our current networks handle the strain?

Moreover, is the coronavirus outbreak and the “social distancing″ required to mitigate the spread going to become the business case for more advanced and robust 5G technologies for a future in which business, health care and human interaction must be at more than an arm’s length?

Read full story here…

In February 2019 the telecom industry admitted that they don’t even have scientific evidence that 5G is safe. Yet many of the powers-that-be still insist that humanity desperately needs this technology. So this desperate need even includes launching satellites to blast it from space. Wack-a-doodle doo.

Entire Baltimore Neighborhood Under Lockdown: “Police Declared Martial Law”,"Reddit Email WhatsApp More 212 Shares

Five days ago, Detective Sean Suiter, a married father of five and an 18-year veteran with the Baltimore Police, was patrolling the streets of West Baltimore around 5pm last Wednesday when he saw suspicious activity. Suiter approached a man and was shot point blank in the head, in a summary execution. He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition where he later died of his injuries.

Rest In Peace Detective Sean Suiter https://t.co/NiKIdmzbAD pic.twitter.com/l7vkrOKjMv — Baltimore Police (@BaltimorePolice) November 16, 2017

In response, Baltimore Police reacted with “fire and fury” turning the neighborhood where Suiter was shot into an “open-air prison,” shutting down city streets and enabling checkpoints for citizens while officers in tactical gear went door to door, according to Baltimore Brew. Residents were prohibited from entering their own neighborhood unless they showed proper identification, these extreme measures have been in place for 4-5 days.

“They’ve been to my house three times asking, ‘Did you hear anything? Do you know anything,’” said Edward Stanley, a local resident, who had to show a yellow slip before entering the neighborhood.

Baltimore Brew said, the neighborhood was tuned into “open-air prison,” as the complete lockdown was in attempt to collect evidence and search for the shooter.

Police initially said they needed to cordon off the area to try to capture the shooter. Police have said Suiter was in the 900 block of Bennett Place, investigating a previous homicide, when he was shot on Wednesday. So far, no arrests have been announced in the case. This morning, homicide detective Mike Newton told The Brew that the lockdown was necessary to collect evidence.

One community group took pictures of a checkpoint in West Baltimore.

Citizens describe how their day lives have been disrupted as West Baltimore remains under police control, as per Baltimore Brew:

Two women walking down Franklin Street to get to their cars, parked blocks away because of the lockdown, complained that they had been harassed by officers.

“They know I live here. They’ve seen me come and go. But this one had to pat me down. He [the officer] went like this to my jacket, grabbing it,” said Shelly, 25, who asked that her last name not be used.

“They wanted to know where I had been. Why do I have to tell him that? It’s just me in my flip-flops trying to go to my own home.”

“We haven’t been able to get our mail for four days,” said the woman with her, Samantha, 50, who also asked not be identified. “Is the city going to pay the late fees on my bills?”

“It’s so sad what happened to the officer and I hope they catch whoever did it,” another woman said. “But this is really overboard. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

The ACLU of Maryland released a statement yesterday, who are “troubled by reports that some persons entering or leaving the area have been subject to pat down searches, and that non-residents have been barred from entering the area.”

“While the search for a killer is, of course, a high priority for the police, the limits on lawful police behavior do not disappear even when engaged in that pursuit. And at least one federal appellate court has said that a similar police cordon and checkpoint system was unconstitutional.

“The residents of Baltimore, and, in particular, the residents of the affected community, deserve a clear explanation from the City as to why this unprecedented action has been taken, what rules are being enforced, and why it is lawful. The need to secure a crime scene from contamination to preserve evidence does not, on its face, explain the wide area to which access has been restricted for days after the incident.”

On-the-ground information is scarce to those outside the cordon because access to residents, including by the media, has also been restricted. For that reason, we encourage anyone who has this kind of information to contact us at [email protected]

2) June 27, 2016 at a street celebration of the life of rapper Lor Scoota

3) Nov. 16-???? in 2017 after Det. Suiter was killed pic.twitter.com/C85qSSl6Br — T’Challa ☀️Ra ? (@BmoreDoc) November 18, 2017

Baltimore Brew concludes by saying the Baltimore Police will “clear the crime scene” on Monday, so in a few hours.

Perhaps in a preview of things to come, the 4-5 day siege of West Baltimore by Police has been described by one resident as “Martial Law.” Readers concerned about social tensions in the US are urged to monitor events in Baltimore, which better than Chicago or Detroit now demonstrates just how the United States is marching straight into a new, Orwellian era.

Lab Created Super-Mosquitos Released Into Wild Could ‘Make All Men Infertile’,"Reddit Email WhatsApp More 110 Shares

Millions of disease carrying mosquitoes are to be freed in a well-meaning bid to decimate natural populations of the malaria-spreading insects.

The lab-grown versions are infected with a disease which prevents natural mosquito populations from breeding.

But some activists fear the disease could transfer to humans ultimately making all human males sterile.

Despite claims it is safe for humans, there are also some concerns, it could affect other arthropods, such as spiders which pray on mosquitoes, therefore increasing populations in the long run, or even people, rendering humans unable to breed.

In a decision that has not been formally announced, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will allow the release of the killer insects in 20 states and Washington DC.

They have been bred by the company MosquitoMate in a bid to drastically reduce the population of the disease-carrying Asian tiger mosquito (A aegypti), which is responsible for infecting humans with viruses such as dengue, yellow fever and Zika, which has caused birth defects in babies.

The firm creates mosquitoes infected with the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis which prevents natural mosquitoes from breeding.

These risks of humans or other arthropods being affected are said to be extremely low, but the full impact will not been known until mass releases happen, according to scientists.

Canadian blogger Rose Webster is behind a campaign to stop the releases.

She has spent months speaking to scientists and fears that it may be possible for Wolbachia to infect humans, and prevent individuals from breeding.

She is also convinced that Wolbachia releases have actually helped the spread of the Zika virus.

She said: “Wolbachia is responsible for the most widespread pandemics in the animal kingdom.

“Safety tests were never carried out on vertebrate species prior to Wolbachia-infected mosquito releases carried out in Brazil, Columbia, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Australia, California, and Florida.

“It’s akin to putting genetic dynamite in a species.

“Wolbachia can survive about a week in a dead host. Lateral transfers to other species have happened.

“This could be the reason that Zika is spreading out of control.

“Wolbachia doesn’t just magically disappear when these mosquitoes die off naturally or are consumed.

“Here is what I am sure of:

“The CDC and WHO (and Health Canada) have ignored critical scientific facts and solid evidence from ethical scientists.

“Why? I don’t know. Perhaps because some regions of the world are so overpopulated that even certain governments are willing to fund something that is likely cause men to become sterile (Wolbachia) and is the unspoken co-factor amplifying Zika.”

An article about the risk on “truth finding” website Courtofrecord.com said: “Years ago, a laboratory experiment to infect mice with Wolbachia failed.

“Scott O’Neill of Yale Medical School points out that the bacteria are intolerant of the basal body temperature of mammals.

“However, Werren points out that it is too early to dismiss the possibility of Wolbachia infecting vertebrates.

“At least some scientists believe the notion of Wolbachia in humans is not entirely preposterous.”

A February 2015 a scientific study of a patient with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma who was found to have wolbachia genes was published on clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com.

It concluded there was the potential for the bacteria to infect humans.

The report said: “Wolbachia spp should be further evaluated as causes of human infection, especially as Wolbachia infection of mosquitoes is increasingly considered to be a tool for interfering with mosquito-borne transmission of human pathogens.

“The findings suggest the potential for Wolbachia bacteria to infect humans.”

Yet many scientists believe it is perfectly safe.

David O’Brochta, an entomologist at the University of Maryland in Rockville, said: “It’s a non-chemical way of dealing with mosquitoes, so from that perspective, you’d think it would have a lot of appeal.

“I’m glad to see it pushed forward, as I think it could be potentially really important.” MosquitoMate rears the infected insects in laboratories. Males, which do not bite, are released into a high mosquito population area. They mate with wild females, and the infection of Wolbachia into the latter means the fertilised eggs do not hatch, because paternal chromosomes do not form properly. The plan is that over time the natural population will dwindle. Stephen Dobson, an entomologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington and founder of MosquitoMate, said other insect populations, including mosquito predators, are not affected by the lab-grown disease. There are concerns that female lab-grown insects, which do bite may be released. Staff currently separate males from females by hand and mechanically based on size differences at pupal stage. Zhiyong Xi, a medical entomologist and microbiologist at Michigan State University, who leads the project, said this is 99 percent successful, meaning up to one percent released could be female. Mosquitoes released are then subject to radiation to sterilise females but not males. The technique has been tested extensively in Brazil, following the 2015 zika outbreak, and populations of disease carriers have drastically dropped in test areas. There were concerns from the public when another firm Oxitec wanted to test the mosquitoes in the Florida Keys area. Objections from the public in late 2016 mean the tests were postponed. Concerns ranged from any risk of the lab-grown insects being able to infect humans, the natural disease carriers becoming immune to them, or it decimating populations of other arthropods, including the spiders that feed on the natural mossies. Oxitec said only 62 female mosquitoes per person in an area would be inadvertently released, but it was hard to predict how many would land on humans. An EPA environmental impact document about the plan said: “Mosquitoes have been feeding on humans and other animals for millennia but there is no evidence of DNA transfer between mosquitoes and humans. “There’s also ‘negligible’ risk that the GM mosquito saliva would have any toxic or allergenic effects on humans.” Simon Warner, Oxitec’s chief scientific officer in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in the UK, said there was “no reason to think their lab strain—descendants of mosquitoes collected in Cuba, crossed with a Mexican strain—would be any more dangerous than another strain of (Asian Tiger mosquito) A aegypti. He said: “Vector competence is not a question that we’ve been asked by the regulators. “We haven’t studied it, because we don’t think it’s a concern.” Oxitec said in tests four percent of infected wild mosquitoes went onto to produce offspring, so some could be immune. Entomologist Zach Adelman, of Texas A&M University in College Station, said: “That’s something that does have to be paid close attention to. “When Oxitec stops its releases, mosquito numbers will rebound, and it is not clear whether or how the genes from the release strain would influence the recovered population, including how mosquitos seek out hosts, mate, or lay eggs. “For example, of key concern is how good Oxitec’s strain is at transmitting viruses compared with wild mosquitoes—its so-called vector competence. “So far, studies of such changes in a post-release population are missing.” Insect geneticist Max Scott of North Carolina State University in Raleigh said it was a “theoretical possibility” that wild mosquitoes could become immune, but that should not stop the tests. Express.co.uk found research carried out by the School of Biological Sciences, at The University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, in 2010, when they were looking to test a similar system. The scientific study considered the risk to humans. It said: “A major concern the community repeatedly expressed was whether Wolbachia could be transferred to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes.” However, it said: “Wolbachia have never been found in humans or other mammals, neither in birds, reptiles or fish.” Despite the limited risks, tests were carried out on people, and no infections were found. It said: “Both immunological investigations, Western blots and ELISA, show that humans repeatedly bitten by Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti develop antibodies against mosquitoes as already described for exposed humans, but do not develop IgG antibody against Wolbachia. “All those results indicate that Wolbachia antigens are not injected into humans during the mosquito bloodmeal and therefore do not initiate an immune response in human host.” However, in a section entitled “To implement or not to implement?”, it said the full effects would not be known until they were released on mass. It said: “A number of experiments were conducted to verify that the Wolbachia-based strategy to control mosquito-borne disease is safe for people, other organisms and the environment. “The results presented in this paper show that no experimental evidence of any negative impact of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes was obtained. “Assessing experimentally the potential consequences that could happen over a long-term period and large geographic scale could be a daunting task. “Many questions related to long-term consequences can only be assessed once the release is done. “Questions such as the evolution of the virus in response to the presence of Wolbachia, or the persistence of the virus blocking phenotype after generations in natural population are examples of key concerns for the scientific project and for the community but indeed require a priori the release to be answered.” via: express.co.uk",2017-11-16 18:28:34-04:00,
Russia’s FSB Reports Michael Jackson Assassinated By CIA,"FSB sources are reporting to President Medvedev today that American pop icon Michael Jackson was “most assuredly” assassinated by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) after an examination of data transmitted by a Russian Military’s Kosmos 2450 satellite show “conclusively” that immediately prior to the music stars death in Los Angeles an electromagnetic pulse consistent in pattern to EMR weapons looted from the former Soviet Union by the United States was employed at the “exact coordinates” of the rock stars home.

To the type of technology being perfected by the US Military-Industrial Complex based upon former Soviet Union research used in these kinds of assassinations we can read about as reported by Cheryl Welsh, president, Citizens Against Human Rights Abuse, in her landmark 2001 report “Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) Weapons: As Powerful As The Atomic Bomb”, and which says:

“A newly declassified U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report says- extensive Soviet research into microwaves might lead to methods of causing disoriented human behavior, nerve disorders or even heart attacks…. A copy of the study was provided by the agency to The Associated Press in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The Pentagon agency refused to release some portions of the study, saying they remain classified on national security grounds.”

Even more importantly, since Ms Welsh’s landmark report in 2001, the US has continued perfecting this insidious technology they’ve named Active Denial System (ADS), and as we can read as reported by New Scientist in their 2005 report titled “US Military seeks new non-lethal weapon; the prototype of the phaser?”, and which says:

“The US military is funding development of a weapon that delivers a bout of excruciating pain from up to 2 kilometres away. Intended for use against rioters, it is meant to leave victims unharmed. But pain researchers are furious that work aimed at controlling pain has been used to develop a weapon. And they fear that the technology will be used for torture.”

To the ‘final’ employment of these weapons [3rd photo, left] we can also read:

“In January 2007, Theodore Barna, an assistant deputy undersecretary of defense for advanced systems and concepts told Reuters that “We expect the services to add it to their tool kit. And that could happen as early as 2010”.

Apparently the military is still unsure about ADS after all the tests. Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne didn’t help clarify the issue when he suggested that the military should use the “pain ray” at crowds in the United States before deploying it in Iraq. It would be hard to imagine that Americans would be feeling okay about trying such weapons on themselves even if they believe they are not lethal.

Wagner suggested a new nickname for the weapon; the “death ray”, since it’s well-known that exposing mammals to microwaves make them explode. He sent an email all around the U.S. in which he used a live example to prove his theory.”

To the reason behind the CIA needing to assassinate Michael Jackson, these reports continue, was an out of court settlement the pop icon signed with son of the king of Bahrain, Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad al-Khalifa, this past November in London, and which stated, in part, that in exchange for millions of dollars previously lent to Mr. Jackson by the Sheikh, Mr. Jackson would allow his sold-out United Kingdom concerts to be a “platform” for warning the World of a soon to occur mass genocide event.

Both Michael Jackson and Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad al-Khalifa have been long standing supporters of the fearless Austrian investigative journalist, Jane Burgermeister, who is warning the world that the greatest crime in the history of humanity is underway, and as we can read:

“Jane Burgermeister has recently filed criminal charges with the FBI against the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations (UN), and several of the highest ranking government and corporate officials concerning bioterrorism and attempts to commit mass murder. She has also prepared an injunction against forced vaccination which is being filed in America. These actions follow her charges filed in April against Baxter AG and Avir Green Hills Biotechnology of Austria for producing contaminated bird flu vaccine, alleging this was a deliberate act to cause and profit from a pandemic.

In her charges, Burgermeister presents evidence of acts of bioterrorism that is in violation of U.S. law by a group operating within the U.S. under the direction of international bankers who control the Federal Reserve, as well as WHO, UN and NATO. This bioterrorism is for the purpose of carrying out a mass genocide against the U.S. population by use of a genetically engineered flu pandemic virus with the intent of causing death. This group has annexed high government offices in the U.S.

Specifically, evidence is presented that the defendants, Barack Obama, President of the U.S, David Nabarro, UN System Coordinator for Influenza, Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO, Kathleen Sibelius, Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Department of Homeland Security, David de Rotschild, banker, David Rockefeller, banker, George Soros, banker, Werner Faymann, Chancellor of Austria, and Alois Stoger, Austrian Health Minister, among others, are part of this international corporate criminal syndicate which has developed, produced, stockpiled and employed biological weapons to eliminate the population of the U.S. and other countries for financial and political gain.

The charges contend that these defendants conspired with each other and others to devise, fund and participate in the final phase of the implementation of a covert international bioweaponsprogram involving the pharmaceutical companies Baxter and Novartis. They did this by bioengineering and then releasing lethal biological agents, specifically the “bird flu” virus and the “swine flu virus” in order to have a pretext to implement a forced mass vaccination program which would be the means of administering a toxic biological agent to cause death and injury to the people of the U.S. This action is in direct violation of the Biological Weapons Anti-terrorism Act.”

Interesting to note, too, is on the day of Michael Jackson’s assassination, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that their mathematical models show over 1 million Americans have contracted swine flu and that of the 58,000 confirmed cases around the World the US has over half of them, and even worse, Emergency Containment Areas are now being reported being set up in that troubled country.

Sadly though, and with an acknowledgement that this World star had led a much troubled life, it can never be taken away from Michael Jackson the real love he had for all of humanity and best expressed by him in the chorus of his anthem to the human race, We Are The World:

Heal the world

Make it a better place

For you and for me and the entire human race

There are people dying

If you care enough for the living

Make a better place for

You and for me.
