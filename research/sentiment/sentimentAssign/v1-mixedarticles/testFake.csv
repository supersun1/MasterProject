"VACCINE SLAUGHTER: An estimated 500,000 sharks will have to be killed and harvested to create a coronavirus vaccine","(Natural News) In the rush to create a vaccine for covid-19, scientists will need at least 500,000 dead sharks over the next six months. The sharks will be slaughtered to provide vaccine makers with an oil called squalene. The squalene is a byproduct produced in the liver of sharks. Smaller amounts of squalene can be found in olive oil, palm oil, wheat-germ oil, amaranth oil and rice bran oil, but these aren’t reliable sources for wide scale vaccine production.In vaccine science, squalene is combined with surfactant chemicals to create an adjuvant which is used to augment an immune response in vaccine recipients. Based on its chemical properties, squalene is an emollient, allowing for vaccine antigens and other chemicals to more readily absorb deep into tissues and cells.The more potent an adjuvant is, the greater the chances that the vaccine antigen (attenuated virus) penetrates the immune system, generating an antibody response in serum. As the potency of the adjuvant is increased, so is the risk of vaccine injury. As the potency of the adjuvant is decreased, the effectiveness of the vaccine wanes, requiring more doses to simulate an immune response.Moreover, the human immune system is prone to produce antibodies to squalene — an under-studied autoimmune effect that could have lasting effects on humans. Even though squalene is a “cleaner” adjuvant than aluminum salts, it is part of scientific process that bypasses the innate immune system, including surveillance proteins, surveillance microbes, mucous membranes, etc.As vaccine dependency increases, shark populations sufferThe mass slaughter of sharks is nothing new; certain types of influenza and malaria vaccines already depend upon squalene harvesting from sharks. As public health officials plan for wide-scale vaccination worldwide, the demand for dead sharks will grow exponentially.The new covid-19 vaccines will not be effective after the first dose. The first experimental protocol requires two doses of the vaccine to simulate any sort of antibody response in humans. As this antibody response wanes, more doses will be needed in order to augment an immune response in humans. Some clinical trials suggest that five to six doses will be needed to keep human antibody levels up. This level of vaccine dependence could drastically affect the shark population.Conservationist group, Shark Allies estimates that 250,000 sharks will need to be slaughtered in order for one vaccine dose to be distributed to the world’s population. If multiple doses are required, as evidenced by waning antibody responses in clinical trials, then millions of sharks would need to be slaughtered over the next three years.Shark Allies founder Stefanie Brendl has launched a petition, demanding an end to the use of squalene in vaccines. She wrote: “Harvesting something from a wild animal is never going to be sustainable, especially if it’s a top predator that doesn’t reproduce in huge numbers. There’s so many unknowns of how big and how long this pandemic might go on, and then how many versions of it we have to go through, that if we continue using sharks, the numbers of sharks taken for this product could be really high, year after year after year.”Vaccine production could ultimately endanger shark populations, only to make human immune systems dependent on vaccine science that wanes over time and puts additional pressure on the oceanic ecosystem.For more on the science behind biologics visit Vaccines.news.Sources include:GreatGameIndia.comNCBI.NLM.NIH.govNaturalNews.comMatyas G, Rao M, Pittman P, Burge R, Robbins I, Wassef N et al.

"Moderna coronavirus vaccine causes side effects in over 50% of patients; antibodies disappear in 2-3 months, rendering the vaccine pointless","(Natural News) The widely-hyped Moderna coronavirus vaccine caused adverse events (side effects) in over 50% of clinical trial participants, including, “fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site.” While it generates antibodies in the short term, new studies indicate those antibodies fade very quickly, rendering the vaccine pointless in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.The side effects of the Moderna mRNA vaccine are documented in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a discredited, pro-pharma junk science rag that lies in favor of Big Pharma in every way possible. As published on Medicine.news, the NEJM was recently caught up with The Lancet in a junk science scheme that sought to discredit hydroxychloroquine through the use of fabricated data that was published in both journals (then was later retracted).The new study is entitled, “An mRNA Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 — Preliminary Report.” It details the astonishing degree of side effects experienced by study subjects, revealing that over half of study participants reported at least one side effect. This chart, from the study, also shows that the side effects are dose dependent, meaning the higher the injection dose, the higher the reported side effects, further strengthening the causal ties between the vaccine and the side effects:As you can see from the chart, 100% of study participants experienced side effects at the 100 ug or 250 ug injection volumes, during the second round of vaccination.100% of study participants experienced side effects in the high-dose second round of vaccinationNotably, 100% of participants experienced headaches, local symptoms and systemic symptoms, while nearly 100% experienced chills, myalgia and fatigue, during the second injections.This study reveals that the vaccine becomes increasingly toxic with subsequent injections, meaning even if the fist injection is relatively well handled by the body, the second injection can be significantly more dangerous.Notably, with other studies now revealing that coronavirus antibodies fade quickly over the period of about 3 months, the mRNA vaccine from Moderna would have to be injected multiple times, perhaps as many as four times each year in order to maintain high levels of antibodies.But with each injection, the vaccine becomes more toxic and produces more side effects. As the study authors conclude, “Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose…”Even with side effects impacting all participants in the second round, study authors claim everything’s fineYet, to no one’s surprise, all these toxic effects of the vaccine that increase with subsequent vaccines are not called out as an item of concern. Given that the study authors are, of course, paid by Moderna to produce pro-vaccine propaganda in the name of “science,” they conclude that all the side effects are perfectly fine, stating: (emphasis added)Across both vaccinations, solicited systemic and local adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Evaluation of safety clinical laboratory values of grade 2 or higher and unsolicited adverse events revealed no patterns of concern… These safety and immunogenicity findings support advancement of the mRNA-1273 vaccine to later-stage clinical trials.Got that? The vaccine is increasingly toxic in higher doses and multiple injections, but it’s still awesome and should move toward production and widespread injections into potentially billions of human beings, despite no long-term safety studies being conducted whatsoever.That’s the vaccine industry in 2020: Screw safety and science, just approve the damn thing and collect the hundreds of billions of dollars from governments buying your vaccine, even if it harms or kills millions of people.Even when the vaccine invokes an antibody response, that’s not “immunity”Note that the production of antibodies in the blood is not the same as “functional immunity.” There is zero evidence that this vaccine makes anyone immune to coronavirus infections.And as Michael Snyder writes on EndOfTheAmericanDream.com, three studies have now found covid-19 antibodies disappear from the body very quickly, rendering antibody-producing vaccines practically worthless:Scientific evidence continues to emerge that indicates that COVID-19 is going to be with us for a very long time to come. Yesterday, I reported on a recent study that was conducted in China and another recent study that was conducted in Spain that both showed that COVID-19 antibodies start to disappear very, very quickly. In fact, the study that was conducted in Spain discovered that some patients that originally tested positive for antibodies “no longer had antibodies weeks later”. Well, now we have a third study to add to the list. A study of COVID-19 patients that was conducted at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust in London found that “just 16.7 percent of the patients had a potent antibody response” after a couple of months had passed…Researchers analyzed immune responses of patients and health care workers at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust in London and found that levels of antibodies that destroy the virus quickly declined after peaking several weeks after patients exhibited symptoms.The study found that 60 percent of the patients had a “potent” antibody response at peak of their battle with the coronavirus. After about two months, however, just 16.7 percent of the patients had a potent antibody response.As Snyder points out, this is a huge finding because it means that coronavirus vaccines will likely only work short-term. After perhaps 90 days or so, the vaccine “wears off” and the antibodies are no longer functional in the body. Even the presence of antibodies doesn’t automatically confer immunity, by the way. Again, from Snyder:In addition, experts are telling us that even if a COVID-19 victim develops antibodies, that does not necessarily mean that individual has immunity. In an article that he authored for CNN, Dr. William Haseltine explained that “only 15% of those who test positive for antibodies make the neutralizing antibodies necessary to develop immunity”…Not only do antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 fade, and perhaps fade quickly, studies have also shown that only 15% of those who test positive for antibodies make the neutralizing antibodies necessary to develop immunity in the first place. And not all of those who make neutralizing antibodies make them at high levels. Some of those infected make no antibodies at all.In other words, even if the mRNA vaccine from Moderna produces antibodies, the whole exercise may be pointless for two reasons:1) Antibodies alone don’t confer immunity.2) Antibodies fade away in just a few weeks.Thus, the Moderna vaccine — which the Big Pharma pimping mainstream media has been hyping up as the savior of humanity — is probably a massive medical hoax that will scam world governments out of hundreds of billions of dollars for a treatment that flat-out doesn’t work.Worse than a hoax, this vaccine will clearly harm large numbers of people, given that 100% of study subjects are already experiencing adverse events in the high dose group, during the second round of injections. How toxic is this going to get during a third vaccine? Or a fourth? And is there any end to how many injections of the same vaccine will be mandated by a corrupt, criminal FDA, CDC and national media that makes all its editorial decisions based on the profit demands of the drug cartels?Finally, keep in mind that globalists who also promote the depopulation agenda are demanding this vaccine be given to Black people first. So wait: Take a toxic vaccine that doesn’t work but that causes huge side effects, and line up all the Blacks to be human guinea pigs?Sounds like globalists and the vaccine industry have a whole new plan for planet Earth beyond 2020, and it has nothing to do with halting the pandemic but everything to do with genocide.Don’t you find it astonishing that while hundreds of U.S. corporations are lining up to claim “Black Lives Matter,” many of those very same corporations are the ones producing the vaccines that will no doubt destroy Black lives?",7/16/20 0:00,-60.14708333
RIGGED: Covid-19 testing kits were distributed years before pandemic was declared,"(Natural News) What motivated the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic at the time they did? How much of the pandemonium, governments’ lock downs and corporate control is an overreaction? How much of it was planned? Whose agendas do these lock downs and economic controls ultimately serve? Did you know that covid-19 testing kits were distributed before the pandemic was declared?A group of 600 medical doctors gathered in Spain and called the covid-19 outbreak “a false pandemic” created for political purposes. Locking people down and convincing them they can spread infections they do not have is a tyrannical curse of oppression. These doctors urge other healthcare professionals, “the media and political authorities to stop this criminal operation, by spreading the truth.”Why are human rights being challenged during a time of human need?In September 2019, the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board released a report titled, ‘A World at Risk’ which detailed how the UN and WHO conduct system-wide training and simulation exercises, including one for covering the deliberate release of a “lethal respiratory pathogen.” Why did Dr. Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates go on record about an impending pandemic, long before one was declared? Why are both these men so adamant about vaccinating the world population?Why are medical edicts being enacted with such punitive force and why is the public health response so focused on restricting personal liberty and controlling economic activity, in mere anticipation of infectious disease? Why is the state taking away personal rights, medical privacy and forcing PPE onto populations through fear and coercion? In October 2019, Bill Gates organized a coronavirus pandemic exercise in New York called Event201. The event focused on how everyone on the planet should be vaccinated. In order to achieve this goal, the population would have need to be conditioned to surrender their rights for the “good of all.”Covid-19 testing kits distributed in 2017 and 2018Are covid-19 testing kits strategically designed to produce false positives, to overstate the number of cases to justify government intervention and isolation of healthy people? The CDC owns not only the patent on the coronavirus but also a patent and exclusive rights to the testing methodology. Why are the covid-19 testing kits producing false positives in those who are not sick, producing false evidence to force quarantines on healthy people and to declare outbreaks that aren’t even real? Why is the medical fraud allowed to persist?If covid-19 appeared in China late 2019, why were covid-19 test kits distributed worldwide, two years before the “pandemic?” The World Integrated Trade Solution database reveals that covid-19 test kits were sent to countries in 2017 and 2018.After this trade information went viral, the World Integrated Trade Solution tried to relabel “covid-19” with an inconspicuous term, “Medical Test Kits.” In the world of trade, this level of vagueness is not permitted. Even though WITS tried to cover up the label, they cannot change the product code. “Medical Test Kits” has the same product code, HS 300215 and it stands for “Covid-19 test kits.”Why has so much focus been put on faulty detection protocols while effective treatments for covid-19 respiratory illness is suppressed? Why are hospital systems so ill-equipped to help patient immune systems? Why are these questions not even allowed on social media, as Facebook unites with the scientific dictatorship known as the WHO and the CDC to control information?For more information, check out, Stop World Control.

Same adjuvant in swine flu vaccine that caused narcolepsy also being used in coronavirus vaccine,"(Natural News) Numerous drug giants, including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi, are busily working to develop new vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). And we have learned that an adjuvant created by GSK that was linked to causing narcolepsy during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic is also slated to be used in these upcoming Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines.Known as ASO3, this adjuvant is part of a proprietary prophylactic technology developed by GSK in partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, that helps to make it easier for vaccine companies to roll out new vaccines in response to pandemics like the one currently said to be responsible for widespread lockdowns.Back in February, CEPI announced that it had coordinated an agreement with The University of Queensland in Australia to begin incorporating GSK’s adjuvant technology into rapid vaccine production systems. And here we are almost six months later and that technology is about to be inserted into new Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines being developed by GSK and Sanofi, and potentially others.“In theory, the adjuvant should cut the amount of antigen that is needed to create effective vaccines,” reported Fierce Biotech several months back. “That benefit, known as antigen sparing, is particularly sought after during pandemic outbreaks as it enables more people to be vaccinated using available antigen supplies.”In other words, GSK’s adjuvant technology will allow technocrat eugenicists like Bill Gates the ability to rapidly roll out new vaccines much more quickly than normal, which is arriving just in time for President Donald Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” vaccine program for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).GSK says don’t worry about the safety and effectiveness of future coronavirus vaccines – it’s all good!As for ASO3, this squalene-containing adjuvant, which also contains DL-?-tocopherol and polysorbate, was first used more than a decade ago in the swine flu vaccine to facilitate the rapid rollout of millions of new jabs. And before long, people who received the shot started to develop narcolepsy, sparking global concern about the vaccine’s safety.Fast-forward to today and this vaccine, known as Pandemrix, is still the subject of considerable controversy over the untold number of lives that were harmed or killed by its use. While GSK claims that ASO3 is not to blame for these cases, the situation is still “unresolved,” according to reports.“GSK, for its part, thinks the pros and cons support the use of the adjuvant, noting that assessments of Pandemrix gave it a positive risk-benefit profile and that there are reasons to think the risks are far lower with 2019-nCOV,” Fierce Pharma further reports.“Though research remains ongoing, currently available scientific data suggests that the occurrence of narcolepsy in the context of the 2009/10 Flu pandemic was associated with a similarity between a protein in the wild type H1N1 virus and a human protein relevant in regulating the sleep cycle, an extremely rare coincidence. Because the similarity was specific to the wild type H1N1 Flu virus, it is unlikely to affect the potential development and use of future 2019-nCOV pandemic vaccine candidates,” a GSK spokesperson is quoted as saying.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that ASO3 was only used for the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and has not been used since. Should it end up appearing in the new Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, which appears probable, be on the lookout for a potential wave of deadly side effects, as well as deaths, stemming from its use.To keep up with the latest news about vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), be sure to check out Pandemic.news.Sources for this article include:EuroNews.comFierceBiotech.comNaturalNews.comCDC.gov",7/22/20 0:00,-15.89
Shocking numbers: Comparing COVID-19 deaths to abortion deaths,"(Natural News) I recently saw the headline from the New York Times about the deaths of over 200,000 Americans to COVID-19, and it got me thinking.(Article by Katie Beatty republished from LifeSiteNews.com)What does that number represent? How does this number relate to the number of abortions committed in the U.S. every year?What I found was shocking, sobering, and heartbreaking.My bachelor’s degree is in mathematics, so my automatic response was to begin crunching numbers. In 2018, a total of 2,839,205 resident deaths were registered in the United States according to the CDC website.The current population of the United States is approximately 330,484,275 and climbing. One person is born every eight seconds, and one person dies every twelve seconds.[1] So what is the average number of deaths from COVID-19 following this model? As of the week of 10/17/2020, there were 208,633 deaths between February 1, 2020 and October 17, 2020 related to COVID. In order to get an accurate average, we have to take the total number of days. Adding up the total:So then we haveTruly a tragedy and a sad loss of life.But wait — what about the babies who are aborted and are not included in the 7,779 deaths per day figure?The last recorded number that I could find for abortions is from 2016, where 623,471 abortions were reported in the United States. The estimation for the actual number of abortions in 2016 is 862,320.That means that the number of babies who are aborted in the United States each day is almost triple the number of people who die daily with COVID-19.Abortion has been legal, however, since the 1973 decisions of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, and COVID-19 has been around only since December. What do the other numbers look like? How many Americans have we lost already to this tragedy? How many empty seats are there at the dinner table because your son or daughter or brother or sister was aborted?Currently, abortion in the United States is on a downward trend with the peak of the crises occurring in 1990. The number of live births is also trending downward. This does not mean that the number of daily abortions is insignificant. In 2017, 18% of pregnancies ended by abortion — in other words, 1 out of every 6 pregnancies.But let’s look a little closer.I compiled the number of registered births between 1973 and 2016, the reported number of abortions per year, and the number of estimated abortions provided by the Guttmacher institute.[2]Total Number of Live Births Total Number of Reported Abortions Total Estimated Number of Abortions 169,287,799 45,269,156 57,368,870169 million live births. 57 million abortions. An entire generation…gone.Let’s find out what that actually means. Once numbers get into the millions, people start to get confused. Just looking at the congressional budget verifies that statement. In order to find the percentage, first, we need to figure out the potential number of live births. I found this number by adding the total number of estimated abortions to the total number of live births.Next we find the percentage of abortions to that potential number of live births through division and multiplication.Twenty-five percent of the population that was supposed to be born in the last 40 years has been aborted? Do you mean to tell me that for every three babies born alive, one was aborted?This is madness. Insanity. This is wrong.It doesn’t end there. The highest recorded number of deaths in one day because of the coronavirus was 2,909 people. The most abortions performed in the United States in one year occurred in 1990, when 1,609,000 children are estimated to have been aborted.In abortion’s heyday, over 4,000 American children were aborted every day. That is one child every 20 seconds. Three children every minute. The COVID-19 peak comes from one single day, but this is 4,408 babies, every day, for 365 days.It continues. In 1980, the ratio of estimated abortions to live births was 43%!That’s almost half of all pregnancies! That is absolute craziness!You can argue to me about fetal viability; your body, your choice; and how a majority of abortions performed are done through medication and in the first 12 weeks until you are blue in the face, but at the end of the day, you will still be wrong if you defend abortion. Every person has a unique genetic code from the moment of conception and is a unique person with rights, born or unborn.Two hundred eight thousand six hundred thirty-three COVID deaths to 57,368,870 abortions is not even half a percentage point. So yes, our great nation is in a crisis. But the crisis is not COVID-19; it is abortion.On this upcoming Election Day on November 3, remember what really matters. All of the people who have tragically lost their lives and their futures to abortion. All of the unique, unrepeatable gifts to society that will never be.After all, there is a reason why the right to life comes first in the Declaration of Independence. If we do not have the right to life, all of our other rights don’t matter.This Election Day, you cannot support Biden/Harris and the ticket of death who want to allow abortions up to the moment of birth because you will be complicit in the greatest injustice of our time. The loss of life that occurs each and every day because of abortion carries more weight than any other issue on the table and is truly the greatest tragedy of our time.Finally, if you have had an abortion, there may be unresolved feelings. Please know that you are not alone. There are programs, like Project Rachel, all over the country that help women struggling with emotional problems after abortion.Reference Table:Year Number of Registered Live Births Number of Reported Abortions Number of Estimated Abortions 1973 3,136,965 615,831[3] 744,600 1974 3,159,958 763,476 898,600 1975 3,144,198 854,853 1,034,200 1976 3,167,788 988,267 1,179,300 1977 3,326,632 1,079,430 1,316,700 1978 3,333,279 1,157,776 1,409,600 1979 3,494,398 1,251,921 1,497,700 1980 3,612,258 1,297,606 1,553,900 1981 3,629,238 1,300,760 1,577,300 1982 3,680,537 1,303,980 1,573,900 1983 3,638,933 1,268,987 (1,575,000) 1984 3,669,141 1,333,521 1,577,200 1985 3,760,561 1,328,570 1,588,600 1986 3,756,547 1,328,112 (1,574,000) 1987 3,809,394 1,353,671 1,559,100 1988 3,909,510 1,371,285 1,590,800 1989 4,040,958 1,396,658 (1,567,000) 1990 4,158,212 1,429,247 (1,609,000) 1991 4,110,907 1,388,937 1,556,500 1992 4,065,014 1,359,146 1,528,900 1993 4,000,240 1,330,414 (1,495,000) 1994 3,952,767 1,267,415 (1,423,000) 1995 3,899,589 1,210,883 1,359,400 1996 3,891,494 1,225,937 1,360,200 1997 3,880,894 1,186,039 (1,335,000) 1998 3,941,553 884,273 (1,319,000) 1999 3,959,417 861,789 1,314,800 2000 4,058,814 857,475 1,313,000 2001 4,025,933 853,485 (1,303,000) 2002 4,021,726 854,122 (1,293,000) 2003 4,089,950 848,163 (1,287,000) 2004 4,112,052 839,226 1,216,050 2005 4,138,349 820,151 1,198,960 2006 4,265,555 846,181 1,242,000 2007 4,316,233 827,609 1,202,960 2008 4,247,694 825,564 1,212,350 2009 4,130,665 784,507 1,151,600 2010 3,999,386 765,651 1,102,670 2011 3,953,590 730,322 1,058,490 2012 3,952,841 699,202 1,011,000 2013 3,932,181 664,435 958,700 2014 3,988,076 652,639 926,190 2015 3,978,497 638,169 899,500 2016 3,945,875 623,471 874,100 Total Number of Live Births Total Number of Reported Abortions Total Estimated Number of Abortions 169,287,799 45,269,156 57,368,870[1] This number was taken on October 22, 2020 from the Census Bureau Population Clock.[2] There was conflicting information between the Guttmacher website and this table.

NO SURPRISE: The five deadliest COVID districts in the U.S. are ‘represented’ by Democrats… and AOC’s is the WORST,"(Natural News) Democratic lawmakers and Democratic ‘leaders’ around the country have become the most vocal in criticizing President Donald Trump and his administration for the administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.This virus has become the most politicized outbreak in the history of our country, and that is due in no small part to the garbage ‘mainstream’ media in our country — most of whom are nothing more than left-wing propagandists and hacks whose entire existence in the age of Trump is to destroy his presidency, no matter if the country goes down with him.Because it’s become so politicized and because the media hasn’t reported on it honestly, Americans have no clue what to believe about it.But here’s one thing that is absolutely true: Democrats are the most responsible for the proliferation of the virus and the resultant tanking of the economy because they are the ones keeping it down and keeping Americans in doubt about ‘the science’ surrounding the virus.Oh, and one other thing: The party that most blames President Trump for the deaths as a result of the virus (the death toll has also been politicized, by the way) represents portions of the country where the most deaths have occurred. (Related: US reports first case of COVID-19 reinfection.)The Western Journal reports:Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez likes criticizing Republicans, particularly President Donald Trump, over their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.On Oct. 6, for instance, AOC criticized Trump for advising Republicans to hold off on negotiating a COVID-19 relief package until after the presidential election, given House Leader Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats’ radical partisanship during stimulus negotiations.“What an anti-everybody agenda looks like,” the New York Democrat tweeted Oct. 6.What an anti-everybody agenda looks like: The President & GOP are walking away from getting ANY COVID stimulus relief done, effectively endangering millions, after *they* themselves got COVID & enjoyed free socialized healthcare, so they can push through an anti-ACA SCOTUS pick. https://t.co/zIidL1d6Rr — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 6, 2020“The President & GOP are walking away from getting ANY COVID stimulus relief done, effectively endangering millions, after *they* themselves got COVID & enjoyed free socialized healthcare, so they can push through an anti-ACA SCOTUS pick.”Yes, well…now, onto some facts.According to Harvard University’s COVID-19 Metrics for United States Congressional Districts project, the districts with the highest number of coronavirus deaths as of the end of September all are represented by Democrats:5.

They don’t run the individual districts; elected local and state leaders do.Therefore, it would be more appropriate to cast aspersions for the high death rate — the No. 1 rate — for her district on New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats.Or no one because it’s a virus and viruses spread. They just do.But still, it’s “ridiculous” for the New York freshman lawmaker “to be lobbing grenades at anyone else” over their response to the pandemic, said The Western Journal’s editor-in-chief George Upper.“Just as I would say that I don’t think Donald Trump has a heck of a lot to do with how many people are dying from COVID,” Upper said last week on “WJ Live,” the Journal’s new podcast, “I wouldn’t hold a representative responsible for that.”“For AOC to be lobbing grenades at anyone else when that’s what her home district looks like is just ridiculous,” he said.“The narrative on the left is that politicians are responsible for it as long as the politicians are Donald Trump. That’s the narrative from the left. It’s ridiculous,” he added.Fact check: True.Sources include:WesternJournal.comNaturalNews.com",10/29/20 0:00,2.873333333
"BOMBSHELL: Covid-19 isn’t a pandemic plan, it’s an EXTERMINATION plan for humanity","(Natural News) About a year ago, I gave a live presentation in Branson, Missouri, that is only now being made fully public. The presentation, shown below via Brighteon.com, reveals that the real master plan which led to COVID is actually an extermination plan for humanity.Population reduction has been the goal all along. But where the globalists have shown their true evil genius is in their choice of creating a biological weapon with high transmission rather than high fatality rates. The virus was never very deadly to people under the age of 50, but it was always highly contagious to people of all ages. And that contagiousness, it turns out, was enough to advance their nefarious plan against humanity.The rapid spread of the virus allowed the globalist-controlled media to claim “cases” were skyrocketing, thereby justifying weaponized lockdowns and a global rolling out of medical fascism disguised as “public health” policies. Based entirely on the speed of the spread of the virus, cities, states and nations of the world were able to achieve three key goals that represent the necessary precursors to global human extermination:Crushing the existing human economies of the world, including food production, ultimately leading to mass famine, homelessness and total dependence on government. Rolling out new, Orwellian medical fascism laws and edicts that set the precedent for mass arrests and forced relocation into “quarantine camps” for those who resist. These camps, of course, are actually death camps and processing facilities for eliminating human beings. Forcing compliance with global vaccine mandates which will of course be used to achieve global infertility and accelerated deaths from diseases and subsequent infections. Whereas a pathogen could not achieve a 90% death rate on its own, the engineered pathogen (the Wuhan coronavirus) was able to be used to drive people into mass vaccine compliance, during which they can be directly injected with toxic substances, vaccine compliance tracking nanotech (quantum dots) and biology-altering mRNA sequences that literally hijack the body’s cells and reprogram them to produce whatever protein sequences are engineered into the mRNA vaccines.Thus, globalists have simultaneously built a global pandemic prison camp combined with a mandatory vaccine obedience system through which they can repeatedly spread more infectious disease and promote accelerated deaths or infertility.The end goal, as globalists like Bill Gates openly support, is the elimination of billions of human beings living today. Ideally, globalists seek to reduce the world population to about 500 million people, which is roughly a 94% reduction in the current human population.The world you once knew is never coming back, because the globalists who run the world have other plansEach day, more and more people are coming to realize that there will be no restoration of the world we all once knew. Globalists have no intention of restoring human freedom, economic prosperity and global mobility. Now, human societies are being deliberately crushed — even in the face of contradictory scientific evidence that shows lockdowns don’t work — in order to cause mass destitution and collapse.Only through this planned collapse can the billions of people in the world be forced into subservience to the globalist depopulation agenda.A key element of this is the Universal Basic Income (UBI), which has already been rolled out across America for the last several months, under the approval of Republicans, Democrats and President Trump. The UBI provides basic sustenance income to allow people to purchase food and stay alive, while CDC mandates prohibit the eviction of renters who can no longer pay rent. Through the UBI, the eviction ban and the pumping up of the stock market with Fed money printing policies, America remains under the false appearance that the economy is rebounding. In truth, these are all temporary, makeshift tactics to prevent millions of homeless from spilling out into the streets right before an election.The real plan — about to be rolled out — is to tie UBI benefits to vaccine compliance and speech compliance. Only the obedient will be granted government credits for food, and anyone who refuses to take the new vaccine will be cut off from government benefits. This is a deliberate “squeeze” to force the sheeple into mass vaccine suicide by making sure they cannot function in society (or receive government benefits) unless they go along with the vaccine mandates, which are of course a global extermination program disguised as a public health program.How vaccines will be used to exterminate billions of humans while amplifying infectious disease on a global scaleThe mass extermination via vaccines consists of two strategies:Lacing the vaccines with new bioweapons viral strains to ensure the continuation of the “outbreak” narrative. Notably, this only requires less than one percent of administered vaccines to be laced. Engineering the vaccines to cause a very high fatality rate upon exposure to a secondary future infection, in a fatal reaction called a “cytokine storm,” which is a hyper-inflammation event that leads to rapid death.Thus, people won’t be dropping dead right away after taking the vaccines. Instead, they will seem fine until the next major bioweapon pandemic hits them, at which point the fatality rate will be extremely high (perhaps as high as 75% averaged across all age groups).The next strain to be released via the vaccines will be COVID-21, and the COVID-21 strain could be rightly considered the second half of a binary weapon system that will achieve extremely high kill rates for human beings across the globe.Importantly, the mass die-offs will further justify government lockdowns, quarantines and medical authoritarianism that grants governments the power to forcefully inject people, kidnap people, imprison people and even exterminate people at will. The mass hysteria from the sudden wave of deaths will also feed directly into the justification of increased censorship by the tech giants, which will de-platform anyone who discusses the truth about how this entire scheme was planned from the start.What ends up being created is a feedback loop of death, hysteria and tyranny. The more people die, the more hysteria the media spreads and the more tyranny is justified by the state. This, in turn, results in higher numbers of vaccine injections, which spread more weaponized viral strains, resulting in another wave of hysteria and so on. It’s the perfect scam of tyranny and depopulation: The very governments who are building the bioweapons are using them to exterminate the masses while using the infections to justify their own power to administer the extermination weapons (i.e. vaccines).Government tyrants are giggling with joy with their newfound powers over life and deathYouTube has just recently confirmed it will ban all vaccine videos that don’t toe the line of Big Pharma and the China-run WHO. We’ve all witnessed the accelerating purges of so-called “anti-vax” channels and speakers across all the major tech platforms. It’s all part of the narrative control that will maintain information monopolies to keep pushing the vaccines, lockdowns and tyranny that’s killing human beings by the billions.This is how they pull it off! It’s not the pandemic that’s really killing people; it’s the governments. And any who don’t surrender to the tyranny will be singled out as “threats” to public health, then silenced or forcibly removed.Victoria, Australia has already beta tested these programs and has found a shocking degree of compliance among the population that’s targeted for extermination. New Zealand has also discovered shockingly high levels of compliance, and Canada is finding much the same thing. As it turns out, “progressive” societies are filled with eager-to-obey sheeple who maintain irrational faith and trust in government — the very same government that’s preparing them all to be terminated.Resistance groups are growing all around the world, including in America where local economies (in conservative states) have fared relatively well by avoiding the punitive lockdowns that now characterize left-leaning cities and states.This is the reason the globalists are working desperately to remove President Trump from power: Trump and his followers are the last remaining defenses for humanity, standing up against the anti-human forces of tyranny and destruction that built the coronavirus bioweapon in the first place (and released it on purpose, then lied about it). Thus, Trump must be removed from power at all costs, and his followers and supporters must be silenced, criminalized, smeared and eliminated at all costs as well. No pro-human voice that resists the COVID-21 tyranny scheme may be allowed to exist, or the entire plan could be placed in jeopardy because it requires broad voluntary compliance of the sheeple who are being culled. The minute the sheeple wake up and realize they are being led to the slaughter, they might not follow orders so easily.How billions of humans will line up and beg to be “suicided” with vaccinesRational people can process most of what I’ve described above, if they do the research and aren’t brain damaged from fluoride, pesticides, heavy metals and 5G. But now we bring in a topic where many people just can’t fathom the reality: Earth’s globalists are following orders from non-human entities.Different people describe these non-human, non-Earth entities in different ways. To some people, they are demons of supernatural origin. To others, they are aliens of extraterrestrial origin. Still others say they are AI systems from advanced civilizations across the cosmos, and another explanation describes these influencing entities as interdimensional beings from a parallel universe. (Interesting note: CERN scientists have announced they are preparing to power up CERN to literally “make contact with a parallel universe,” according to mainstream media headlines.)Whatever you call it, there exist non-human influences that seek to utterly eliminate the human race and cleanse planet Earth of humans. By some accounts, globalists have even been handed exotic technologies — such as genetic engineering tech, nanotech or anti-matter energy tech — to help achieve these goals in an efficient manner.In essence, globalists have been commanded to eliminate most human beings in the most efficient manner possible, and it turns out that the most efficient way to achieve that is to convince humans to commit medical suicide. (i.e. line up and beg for vaccines). It’s actually much more work to try to exterminate human beings by force, because they will resist with force. But if you can roll out a global pandemic, crush the world’s economies, enslave the people while driving them all bankrupt and then demand their obedience to a medical police state, those very same people you are trying to eliminate will line up and beg to be “suicided” with vaccines.And that’s precisely how this is being accomplished. Under the Trump administration, this program is called “Operation Warp Speed,” but Trump himself isn’t on board with the final solution, we believe. Rather, he’s playing along for other reasons, such as using the operation to strategically place military personnel in cities across America in preparation for a possible civil war uprising by Leftists.But even the name “Operation Warp Speed” should be a red flag. Translated into the real goals of the globalists, it would be called Operation Fast Kill.Why kill off human with vaccines when nuclear weapons would be so much faster? Answer: Organism specificityYou might wonder why the anti-human forces don’t simply nuke the planet and eliminate humans that way. The answer is because Earth’s ecosystem has value to all intelligent entities, and they do not seek the ruination of this planet; merely the elimination of the humans who inhabit it. Whatever weapon they use must be deployed with organism specificity so that it kills only humans, not apes, monkeys or other non-human primates, nor other mammals.This is why genetically engineered vaccines are the ideal weapon for the extermination of humanity: They are very specific to human beings and pose essentially no risk of harm to the larger biosphere.The point is to kill humans before humans kill the biosphereIn terms of motivations for all this, many believe this effort is also aligned with the idea that humans are in the process of destroying Earth’s biosphere — via pollution, radiation, microplastics, ecological destruction, etc. — and that if humans aren’t eliminated, the planet will reach a tipping point and find itself plunged into a mass extinction event which might require millions of years of recovery time.This argument has nothing to do with the hoax of “climate change,” but rather centers on the mass chemical pollution and ecological destruction that humans continue to unleash across the planet, with complete disregard for the long-term effects of such actions.From the point of view of non-humans, humans have become a cancer to Earth, and healing the Earth will require removing that cancer (i.e. human beings).In summary so far:Non-human entities have ordered globalists to engineer a scheme in which billions of humans can be eliminated without much of a fight.The Wuhan coronavirus was engineered and released to stir up mass media hysteria in order to justify the deployment of medical police state policies around the globe.Human economies were deliberately crushed in order to obliterate economic abundance and make most humans economic slaves (refugees) dependent on government, taking away their individual liberties or economic options.Governments will only pay benefits to those who agree to line up and get vaccinated with the “kill switch” vaccines.The deaths won’t occur immediately, but upon exposure to the next pathogen being released in the binary weapon depopulation scheme.Once the great masses of human sheeple have been culled, the non-human entities can engage the remaining human resistance forces and eliminate them in a mop-up operation, preparing planet Earth for post-human colonization and other applications. Those human globalists who aided in the extermination agenda will of course be betrayed and eliminated themselves. Bill Gates, in other words, will eventually wind up with his own head on a stick, too.Watch the Oblivion Agenda lecture series to get the full explanation in great detailIn the following 4-part lecture, I reveal why Earth has cosmic real estate value that’s recognized by all intelligent civilizations, and why Faster-Than-Light (FTL) travel technology is ubiquitous across the cosmos. Earth’s location in the Milky Way galaxy puts it right in the thick of traffic from other civilizations, who have obviously watched the rise of Homo Sapiens and have no doubt sounded alarm bells over the nuclear weapons testing that humans have been carrying out since 1945.Setting off nukes on your own planet, by the way, is sort of a cosmic-scale way to announce to the universe, “We are here, and we are infinitely stupid. Someone please stop us before we destroy everything within reach.”Even aliens, you see, can’t change the laws of physics. Radioisotopic half-lives are the same, everywhere in the cosmos, and they can’t be altered when anything short of nuclear fusion or fission reactors. Once you contaminate a planet with radiation, that planet is a biohazard for millennia, if not longer, and this holds true no matter what life form you might have in mind for occupying that planet.Thus, with humanity’s mass pollution of the oceans due to microplastics, combined with the Fukushima disaster and the impending structural collapse of the Three Gorges Dam which will unleash a wave of nuclear accidents that poison most of the Northern Hemisphere, observers who have been watching Earth have reached what they see as the point of necessary interventions to save Earth from humanity. It appears they have made the decision to initiate the extermination of humans.Biological weapons use human tissue to replicate the weapon itself, allow the weapon to be race-specific and to focus its second wave of binary death on the most highly-populated areas (cities). It is no coincidence that cities are where lockdowns and vaccine compliance programs are being most aggressively announced as well. This is where mass compliance can achieve the most efficient mass exterminations in the years ahead.How political upheaval and civil war play right into the mass extermination agendaWithin this framework of the mass extermination of humans, any geopolitical wars or civil wars that can accelerate economic destruction and the collapse of public health are viewed as aiding the larger goal of global extermination. Notably, nuclear weapons will not be allowed to be deployed for the reasons stated above (i.e. the pollution is impossible to reverse). They can, instead, be decommissioned after launch via exotic non-Earth tech which has already been deployed against ICBM tests.But conventional, kinetic wars between nations will be encouraged, as will domestic wars. Anything that promotes chaos, death, economic destruction and the collapse of health infrastructure is seen as accelerating the end goal of global depopulation.Part of the mass mind control of humans is to keep people focused on small, tribal differences (Republicans vs. Democrats, Black vs. White or China vs. the USA) rather than realizing all humans have been targeted for extermination, and that we all share a common enemy which is not of this Earth.In less than 10,000 years, humans went from innocent, indigenous dwellers to insane, destructive, technocrats who threaten not just Earth, but every planet we can reach. As we stand on the cusp of interplanetary travel and colonization, it seems that our cosmic neighbors have decided that humans are a threat to the cosmos and must not be allowed to continue to exist.Ending humanity, they believe, is necessary to save Earth. And this is the plan you are seeing rolled out right now.Last year, I called this cosmic plan the Oblivion Agenda. I’ve even posted more podcasts and videos about all this at the website OblivionAgenda.com.Here are the videos from the Branson lecture in 2019, during which I presented this to the world. I held them back for the last six months or so, believing most of humanity wasn’t ready to handle this information. I’m hoping that now, after the covid-19 wake up call for humanity, the human race might be ready to learn the truth and hear this information.Part 1:Brighteon.com/2c858fe9-2bd6-4d0a-852d-cda51f21727aPart 2:Brighteon.com/a8111b7d-581e-45fd-a8a9-ae508ac4a3dbPart 3:Brighteon.com/c8bf3c3e-ac0e-41a5-bf9f-55eaf15f2063Part 4:Brighteon.com/6afd196d-f7f0-4267-9365-87d15bc06ed5Listen to more podcasts on this topic at OblivionAgenda.com and follow my daily social media posts at Brighteon.social where my username is @HealthRanger.",10/20/20 0:00,-36.47135338
"Major lawsuits coming for political tyrants who used coronavirus to steal freedom, destroy lives","(Natural News) With regards to the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), President Trump has repeatedly warned against a “cure” that is worse than the “disease.” And now that “cure” is the subject of new litigation that seeks justice against the political tyrants who told us all that we had to hole up at home in a mask in order to “flatten the curve.”The Außerparlamentarischer Corona Untersuchungsausschuss (ACU), also known as the “Corona Extra-Parliamentary Inquiry Committee,” is a German group leading the charge to sue the pants off of every politician and government official out there who decided it would be a good idea to force everyone to stay home for months on end, which destroyed many small businesses while decimating the economy and ruining people’s lives.An international class-action lawsuit, which is backed by more than 500-and-growing doctors and medical experts, aims to remedy the pain and suffering that tens of millions of innocent people have suffered at the hands of authoritarians who demanded “lockdowns” as the solution to the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).Led by Dr. Reiner Fuellmich, one of the founders of the ACU, the lawsuit demands tens of billions of dollars in restitution for those who lost their jobs, developed mental problems, lost loved ones to suicide, or who otherwise suffered immensely due to the deadly “lockdowns” that were imposed on most of the West.These government-ordered lockdowns “caused the loss of innumerable human lives, and have destroyed the economic existence of countless companies and individuals worldwide,” the suit explains.Dr. Fuellmich specifically calls out the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) hysteria peddlers who induced “deliberate panic-mongering” in order to implement “fascist totalitarian models” of governance that were hatched by none other than communist China, the dictatorship responsible for unleashing the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).Children everywhere, Dr. Fuellmich laments, have been “traumatized en masse” by the lockdowns and mask-wearing, “with the worst psychological consequences yet to be expected in the medium and long term.” And in Germany alone, as many as 800,000 small- and medium-sized businesses have closed due to the economic fallout of such restrictions.Lockdowns and other draconian mandates represent “crimes against humanity”All of this was predicated by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) declaration of a “pandemic” back in March, which was fraudulent to begin with considering the fact that the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) is hardly the universal death sentence that those with a horse in the race have long claimed it to be.“This corona crisis, according to all we know today, must be renamed a corona scandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages,” Dr. Fuellmich explains in a video that, naturally, was banned by YouTube – you can still watch it here on Bitchute, though.Dr. Fuellmich further warns that the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests being used to identify “cases” of the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) are fraudulent, as even the inventor of the test, Kary Mullis, admitted that “you can find almost anything in anybody” using a PCR test.Mullis died just a few months before the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) started making headlines, but the fact of the matter is that the PCR test is not a reliable indicator of anything, and can easily be used to perpetrate massive fraud on the masses.“Under the rules of civil tort law, all those who have been harmed by these PCR test-induced lockdowns are entitled to receive full compensation for their losses,” says Dr. Fuellmich who, by the way, has been incredibly successful with past litigation.“In particular, there is a duty to compensate, i.e. a duty to pay damages for the loss of profits suffered by companies and self-employed persons as a result of the lockdowns and other measures,” he says.For more related news about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), be sure to check out Pandemic.news.Sources for this article include:TheNewAmerican.comBitchute.comNaturalNews.com",10/27/20 0:00,-30.7537931
"Coronavirus vaccine trial subjects report extreme exhaustion, shortness of breath, day-long headaches and shaking so violently that one of them cracked a tooth","(Natural News) Get ready for the depopulation kill shots that cause severe neurological damage and lobotomize anyone stupid enough to take them. Even mainstream media outlet CNBC.com is now reporting that vaccine trials conducted by Moderna and Pfizer are producing extreme side effects in trial subjects.“High fever, body aches, headaches and exhaustion are some of the symptoms participants in Moderna and Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine trials say they felt after receiving the shots,” reports CNBC:Luke Hutchison woke up in the middle of the night with chills and a fever after taking the Covid-19 booster shot in Moderna’s vaccine trial. Another coronavirus vaccine trial participant, testing Pfizer’s candidate, similarly woke up with chills, shaking so hard he cracked a tooth after taking the second dose.High fever, body aches, bad headaches and exhaustion are just some of the symptoms five participants in two of the leading coronavirus vaccine trials say they felt after receiving the shots.CNBC goes on to explain that the study participants then claimed all the pain, “was worth it.” Worth it for what? For a pandemic that’s already over for people under the age of 70?These are all symptoms of neurological damage occurring in real timeHere’s a more detailed description of the side effects reported by a pro-science, pro-vaccine trial participant:After getting the first shot on Aug. 18, he said he felt a little under the weather for several days with a low-grade fever. He got his second shot at a clinic on Sept. 15. Eight hours later, he said he was bed bound with a fever of over 101, shakes, chills, a pounding headache and shortness of breath. He said the pain in his arm, where he received the shot, felt like a “goose egg on my shoulder.” He hardly slept that night, recording that his temperature was higher than 100 degrees for five hours.After 12 hours, Hutchison said he felt back to normal and his energy levels returned. Having signed a lengthy consent form, Hutchison was aware that he might experience symptoms. But he was still struck by the severity and duration, tweeting on Sept. 16 that he experienced “full on Covid-like symptoms.”Does this sound like a “safe” vaccine to administer to hundreds of millions of people? Full-on Covid-like symptoms?What CNBC isn’t saying, of course, is that all these symptoms — extreme exhaustion, long duration headaches and violent shaking — are signs of neurological damage happening in real time.These are obvious signs that a kind of vaccine lobotomy is taking place, causing permanent, long-term neurological damage to the trial participants (who may already be brain damaged to begin with, as they volunteered for these medical experiments).Fascinatingly, CNBC also explains that some people are dumb enough to raise their hands and actually volunteer to be used as human guinea pigs for these insane medical experiments:Hutchison, a 44-year-old computational biologist in Utah, said he signed up for Moderna’s phase three trial because he’s healthy, physically fit and a big believer in vaccines. He specifically wanted to support Moderna’s effort, as he was intrigued by the company’s RNA-based approach.CNBC says Luke Hutchison, “signed up to a coronavirus vaccine trial because he’s ‘pro science.'” It’s almost hilarious, if it weren’t so tragic. Little does he know that the vaccine cares nothing about science but everything about profits, which means rushing dangerous vaccines to market through the use of human medical experimentation that will no doubt kill some people along the way.I doubt Hutchison will be feeling good about all this with his nervous system starts to disintegrate. But to each his own… People who think vaccines are rooted in “science” are in for a very rude awakening.“Pro-science” vaccine trial participants may be covering up side effects to protect vaccine companiesIt’s also clear that these trial participants are now being used as public relations puppets for the vaccine industry, and that’s a whole new, dangerous medical propaganda agenda that we haven’t seen before. When the trial participants enter the trials with a “pro-vaccine” cheerleading bias, they are likely to downplay the severity of the side effects they experience, and this causes the vaccine manufacturer to improperly assess the real adverse events associated with the vaccine.In effect, the “pro-science” human guinea pigs rig the trials by covering up for the vaccine side effects, allowing the vaccine manufacturers to achieve FDA approval for dangerous, toxic vaccines that may go on to injure or kill far more people than the pandemic itself.At some point, we all have to say, “If these people want to commit vaccine suicide, let them commit vaccine suicide,” because there’s nothing you can say to stop them. If they want to sacrifice their own lives in the name of “pro-science,” then that’s their free will choice.After all, somebody has to be among the first pioneers to take the kill shots. Why not let people self-select for that and win the Darwin award for pro-science stupidity?See more stories on vaccine injuries at VaccineInjuryNews.com",10/1/20 0:00,-58.41085714
"OBEY OR ELSE: New England Journal of Medicine says people refusing MANDATORY coronavirus vaccines should be severely punished, locked in their homes and fired from their jobs","(Natural News) Welcome to the new medical fascism of 2020. The New England Journal of Medicine, the same fake science rag that committed total fraud to dishonestly smear hydroxychloroquine and protect the interests of vaccine companies, is now saying that all human beings must be forced to take mandatory vaccines. Those who refuse should face severe punishment, the NEJM insists, and insidious measures should be pursued to make sure no one can challenge the punishments in a court of law.Source: Ensuring Uptake of Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, October 1, 2020, N Engl J Med 2020; 383:1296-1299“[B]ecause of the infectiousness and dangerousness of the virus, relatively substantive penalties could be justified, including employment suspension or stay-at-home orders for persons in designated high-priority groups who refuse vaccination,” says the NEJM paper.It also states that authoritarian medical personnel should bypass due process so that no one can challenge their orders in a court of law, stating, “Neither fines nor criminal penalties should be used, however… criminal penalties invite legal challenges on procedural due-process grounds [and] may stoke distrust.”It goes on to explain that vaccine mandates should not be promoted as mandates. Instead, those who refuse vaccines should be harshly punished as a way to force the mandates without ever declaring it. “[S]tate mandates should not be structured as compulsory vaccination (absolute requirements); instead, noncompliance should incur a penalty,” the paper states.And then, incredibly, the same paper goes on to claim that health authorities must “build public trust” through a “transparent and inclusive process,” even though the same paper openly claimed the public should be misled and coerced into vaccine mandates.To its credit, the paper does argue that vaccine manufacturers should not be involved in crafting public policy or pushing mandates, since no one trusts the vaccine companies anymore. (Amazing how quickly that happened, isn’t it?)So the bottom line here is as follows:The health authoritarians are pushing for mandatory vaccines, but they won’t call them “mandates.”Instead, they will PUNISH you for refusing to go along with their mandates, making your life miserable.They are avoiding any mandates that could be challenged in a court of law in order to bypass due process.They then claim this is how the vaccine industry can “build trust” with the public by pretending to be engaged in “transparency.”Thanks to covid-19 tyrants, the whole idea of “informed consent” is now ancient history across the medical science establishment. Vaccine promoters believe they are the new “Judge Dredd” enforcers of society, and they believe that their experimental concoctions, no matter how risky or dangerous, should be forcibly injected into all human beings. Those who resist should be severely punished, they claim, and they will punish you in a way that you can’t challenge in a court of law.And the fake news media is 100% behind all this and will shame you if you don’t go along.Watch the warning from Dr. Carrie Madej in a new interview from just a few day ago:In effect, they are rolling out a “vaccine social credit scoring” system that demands your complianceWhat you’re watching here is a vaccine social credit scoring system being rolled out across America, right in front of our eyes.Don’t want the vaccine shot? You’re fired from your job.Still don’t want the shot? You’ll be prohibited from entering grocery stores and buying food.Resisting the vaccine mandates? Health “authorities” will lock you in your own home, making you a prisoner without ever hauling you into court where you might be able to offer a defense against imprisonment.This is the new covid-19 / vaccine authoritarian tyranny, and it’s being rolled out right this very minute, right in front of you, all across America. New York has just announced a second wave of lockdowns, and no one is resisting.The sheeple will line up for the slaughter, and they will not speak out or resist as they are bled to death in the name of global population control. Anyone stupid enough to agree to be vaccinated is too stupid to represent the future of the human race. They will be systematically culled with the kill shot. How else will the globalists achieve their goal of exterminating over six billion humans, after all?Stay informed and you just might stay alive.

"BOMBSHELL: Former Pfizer executive says covid-19 “pandemic is over,” so-called “second wave” based on fraudulent testing","(Natural News) Despite claims by Anthony Fauci and others that Americans should brace for a “second wave” of the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19), former Pfizer Chief Science Officer Dr. Mike Yeadon says this is nothing but fear-mongering based on junk science and fraud.A former vice president at the pharmaceutical giant, Dr. Yeadon claims that “almost all” of the tests being conducted for the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) are “false positives,” a phenomenon that has already been observed in Florida. Dr. Yeadon also says that “there is no science to suggest a second wave should happen.”Any “second wave” that comes along is completely manufactured based on fake “new cases,” Dr. Yeadon is further quoted as saying, responding in the affirmative when asked if “we are basing a government policy, an economic policy, a civil liberties policy, in terms of limiting people to six persons in a meeting … all based on what may well be completely fake data.”“Were it not for the test data that you get from the TV all the time, you would rightly conclude that the pandemic was over, as nothing much has happened,” Dr. Yeadon further stated, noting that more people will probably be admitted to hospitals for influenza in the coming months, but that these should not be mistaken as Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) admissions.Be sure to check out the following video from Brighteon.com in which Dr. Yeadon talks to interviewer Julia Hartley-Brewer about the truth concerning the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) plandemic:Dr. Yeadon published a paper suggesting that the “curve” was “flattened” months agoEarlier this month, Dr. Yeadon and his colleagues published a paper they co-authored about the so-called “pandemic.” Entitled, “How Likely is a Second Wave?” this paper explains that most of the deaths associated with the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) occurred back in March and April, and quickly tapered off in the months that followed.By April, most countries, including the U.S., had successfully “flattened the curve,” though increased testing, most of which is fraudulent, continues to report new “cases” that those in favor of continued pandemic restrictions are using as “evidence” to push for endless mask-wearing, physical distancing and in some cases, lockdowns.“It has widely been observed that in all heavily infected countries in Europe and several of the U.S. states likewise, that the shape of the daily deaths vs. time curves is similar to ours in the U.K.,” this paper reveals. “Many of these curves are not just similar, but almost super imposable.”This is further reflected in the latest survival figures, which since the month of May have risen to 99.8 percent of infections – meaning only 0.2 percent of people who test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) end up dying at some point after being “diagnosed.”This 99.8 percent survival rate is significantly higher than the one proposed by Fauci back in March and April when he falsely claimed that upwards of 6 percent of Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) patients would die from the virus – meaning Fauci incorrectly claimed that the novel virus was 20 to 30 times more deadly than it actually is.“The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) value accepted by Yeadon et al in the paper is .26%,” writes Ralph Lopez for HubPages. “The survival rate of a disease is 100% minus the IFR.”Concerning the allegedly “novel” nature of the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19), Dr. Yeadon claims that it is only novel in the sense that it is a new type of coronavirus. As it turns out, there are many other types of coronaviruses in existence, including four other strains that are freely circulating throughout the population as you read this.“They all have striking sequence similarity to the new coronavirus,” Dr. Yeadon points out in his paper, offering a different perspective that is rarely, if ever, mentioned by the mainstream media.Sources for this article include:HubPages.comNaturalNews.comBrighteon.com",9/30/20 0:00,-11.91232558
Virologists documents biological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created as a bio-weapon and INTENTIONALLY released,"(Natural News) Li-Meng Yan, the Chinese virologist who was censored off various social media platforms, has published a second co-authored report warning that SARS-CoV-2 is an “unrestricted bio-weapon” that was not only created in a Wuhan lab, but was also released INTENTIONALLY by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Li-Meng Yan worked undercover at the University of Hong Kong and in a reference lab for the World Health Organization before coming clean about the scientific fraud behind China’s bio-weapon release. She and her colleagues discovered biological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created from a template virus (ZC45/ZXC21) and owned by military research laboratories that answer to the Chinese Communist Party.Virologists warns that SARS-CoV-2 was created as a bio-weaponThe paper exposed how the template virus, owned by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), was engineered over a six-month time frame to become SARS-CoV2. The paper reveals that Wuhan virologists went beyond gain-of-function research to engineer the new bio-weapon, and even used data fabrications to cover up the origin of SARS-CoV2.The report also takes a closer look at the RaTG13 virus, which was allegedly obtained from bat feces in 2013. The sequencing of this virus, published at GenBank, has been compared to SARS-CoV-2 and shown to be 96 percent identical. Because of RaTG13’s similarities with SARS-CoV-2, the Chinese Communist Party has alleged that both are naturally-occurring viruses. The CCP declared that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 must be naturally occurring because they are taken from a fecal sample. Fecal samples are typically 70-90 percent bacterial; but these sequences were only 1.7 percent fecal matter. Furthermore, RaTG13 contains segments of DNA not just from bats, but also from foxes, flying foxes, squirrels, and other animals.Since no live virus or intact genome has ever been isolated or recovered in nature for RaTG13, the naturally-occurring theory is dis-proven. Therefore, these two viruses are part of an ongoing line of virus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.According to the paper, the process for sequencing DNA itself “leaves room for potential fraud.” The RaTG13 genome “could easily be fabricated.” Its entry on GenBank proves the viral genomic sequences and its associated sequencing reads are assembled and do not offer definitive proof that the viral genome is correctly represented.The paper details how the RNA viral genome can be fabricated on GenBank with careful execution. After the genomic sequence is created on a computer, segments of the genome can be synthesized based on the sequence. After amplifying each DNA segment through PCR, the researcher can send the PCR products for sequencing. These may contain sequencing samples from an alleged host that are mixed with genetic material from the host, which is ultimately (fraudulently) used to determine the sequence of the virus from these “raw sequencing reads” which are then published on GenBank. This laboratory concoction, fused with a host and amplified, can then be used as false evidence to declare the virus to be a “natural-occurring” version of the corresponding virus.Furthermore, the researchers took a closer look at the spike genes of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13. They found no evidence of natural evolution when compared to sequences of naturally-evolving coronaviruses. The report finds that the RBM region of the S1/spike of the RaTG13 strain had be edited in order to retain the 96.2 percent sequence identity. The report also finds that “All fabricated coronaviruses share a 100% amino acid sequence identity on the E protein with ZC45 and ZXC21,” a process that served as a template for the creation of SARS-CoV-2.We must stop China’s bio-weapon research now and hold them accountable for war crimesBecause the genomic sequence is readily manipulated, what if the tests for covid-19 are unable to locate the precise genomic sequence? What if the vaccines currently in development do not contain the correct strain? What if multiple bio-weapon strains already exist, with various degrees of infectivity? What if China’s bio-weapon research is already ten steps ahead of the public health hysteria, and the CCP is preparing to unleash even more lethal bio-weapons? If China’s scientific fraud and bio-weapon research is not halted, then what’s stopping the rogue communist regime from unleashing a new bio-weapon every six months to stealthily perpetuate outbreaks that can be engineered to subvert detection?Stay up-to-date with the latest news on biological weapons at BiologicalWeapons.newsSources include:Zerohedge.comZenodo.org",10/9/20 0:00,-56.54870968
COVID-19 vaccine trial participant DIES… AstraZeneca downplays the death and continues the medical experiments on the remaining humans,"(Natural News) A person who volunteered for the medical experimentation on humans with the COVID-19 vaccine has died during clinical trials, reports The Epoch Times. The death was confirmed by government officials in Brazil, where the trial was taking place, and the company whose vaccine is being tested in the medical experiments — AstraZeneca — says it will continue its experiments on the remaining human survivors.No deaths will stand in the way of vaccine profits, it seems.“The volunteer died on Oct. 15,” reports The Epoch Times. “It’s not clear whether the volunteer received the placebo shot or the vaccine.”Had this person died in any other context, their death would of course have been counted as a “covid-19 death,” but since they are involved in a vaccine trial, the scheming mainstream media will claim the person received a placebo, not a live vaccine. Such claims are complete fiction, given that no such patient data are allowed to be released on individual patients. As TET reports:The health authority noted that “data on clinical research volunteers must be kept confidential, in accordance with the principles of confidentiality, human dignity, and protection of participants,” according to a news release.Thus, any media outlet reporting the vaccine trial participant was part of the placebo group is lying. Then again, all they do is lie.The human medical experiments continue, no matter how many die in the process“We cannot comment on individual cases in an ongoing trial of the Oxford vaccine as we adhere strictly to medical confidentiality and clinical trial regulations, but we can confirm that all required review processes have been followed,” said AstraZeneca in a public statement.This isn’t the first indication of dangerous side effects linked to coronavirus vaccines. “It came after AstraZeneca said on Sept. 8 that its vaccine trial was placed on hold due to an illness in a patient in the United Kingdom,” reports TET. “The Food and Drug Administration placed a late-stage clinical trial from AstraZeneca on hold in the United States.”Just yesterday, Natural News reported how Johnson & Johnson was forced to halt another coronavirus vaccine trial after a trial participant experienced an “unexplained illness.” As that story explains:Johnson & Johnson is pausing its Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine trial after a study participant fell ill. The halt comes just weeks after the company announced that they were in the final stage of the trials.In its news release, Johnson & Johnson said that the trial was paused in compliance with regulatory standards after the unnamed participant developed an “unexplained illness.”In related news, nine people have died in South Korea after receiving flu shots there, causing a nationwide panic over the “death vaccines” that are killing so many people so quickly. As Strange Sounds reports:Nine people have died after getting flu shots in South Korea in the past week, raising concerns over the vaccine’s safety just as the seasonal inoculation programme is expanded to head off potential COVID-19 complications.Health authorities there are saying the vaccines didn’t kill anyone, since the dead people had “underlying health conditions,” which is exactly what Natural News warned would be said about vaccine deaths as the body count started to accelerate. Notably, when people with underlying health conditions die with a coronavirus infection, they are said to have died from covid-19. But when they have underlying health conditions and are found dead after receiving a vaccine injection, health authorities claim the vaccine isn’t related to their death.How convenient.Operation Fast KillIt all begs the question: If human volunteers are now starting to die during the carefully controlled trials that recruit extremely healthy individuals for testing, what’s going to happen when these risky, rushed vaccines are unleashed upon the wildly unhealthy general public?Operation Warp Speed is about to become Operation Fast Kill, it seems.Then again, there’s no faster way for globalists to exterminate people who are too stupid to realize the covid-19 agenda is actually an extermination agenda targeting the human race.On the other hand, those who are intelligent enough to want to survive should be steering clear of all vaccines and vaccine industry medical experiments carried out on humans.

"President Trump and First Lady both test “positive” for COVID-19… doesn’t that mean Joe Biden and Chris Wallace are now infected, too?","(Natural News) President Trump announced late last night that he and First Lady Melania Trump have both “tested positive” for covid-19. According to his tweet (below), “We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”But does this test result mean anything? We already know from numerous media reports — including the NY Times — that the vast majority of “positive” test results are false.Neither President Trump nor Melania Trump are showing any symptoms of sickness, so they don’t quality as being sickened by the coronavirus.Furthermore, President Trump is likely still taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure, which means his real-world risk of ever showing symptoms of sickness is extremely low, despite his age of 74.This diagnosis is probably meaningless. The tests currently being used to diagnose “positive” cases are extremely unreliable and can be triggered by almost any previous coronavirus infection, such as a common cold type coronavirus.In fact, nearly all the global testing for covid-19 is scientifically meaningless. Since there’s no science-based confidence in either the accuracy or specificity of such tests, they offer no useful information to someone who either tests positive or negative.Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2020“Trump had rallies scheduled on Friday and Saturday in Florida and Wisconsin, respectively, but it is unlikely that those will go forward,” reports Breitbart.com. But it seems pointless to alter the president’s schedule based on a test result that isn’t reliable in the first place.Some users at Brighteon.social are speculating that the covid-19 diagnosis may be a cover for Trump going into hiding while he activates a military response against left-wing insurrectionists and deep state traitors. That’s pure speculation at this point, but it does seem like America is headed into a civil war / uprising scenario where the president will need to take extraordinary measures to protect himself and his family members from a deep state coup attempt.Watch for deranged Leftists to now publicly hope that Trump will die from the infection, because that’s the kind of “death wish” lunatics they are.In truth, President Trump is extremely unlikely to be harmed by the virus, because most covid-19 deaths occur among elderly people who are killed by ventilators or who suffer from numerous severe health conditions such as high blood pressure or strokes.The real question here is that if Trump is truly infected, then did Trump accidentally infect Joe Biden since both candidates were screaming and spitting at each other during the recent debate?And is Fox News fake moderator Chris Wallace infected, too, since he was sitting right in front of them while wearing no mask? Wouldn’t that be the most ironic story of the year if President Trump infected Chris Wallace with the coronavirus while Wallace interrupted him 75 times in 90 minutes?Finally, Joe Biden visually appears to be in far worse health than Trump, so if Biden gets infected, he would seemingly have a much higher risk of serious complications or death. Then again, if Joe Biden disappeared into a lockdown quarantine, nobody could tell the difference, since he almost never appears in public anyway.",10/2/20 0:00,-39.19434783
Irrefutable: The coronavirus was engineered by scientists in a lab using well documented genetic engineering vectors that leave behind a “fingerprint”,"(Natural News) Every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists. The proof is in the virus itself: The tools for genetic insertion are still present as remnants in the genetic code. Since these unique gene sequences don’t occur by random chance, they’re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab.But the WHO and CDC are covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China and its biological weapons program, since no government wants the public to know the full truth about how frequently government-run labs experience outbreaks. Decades ago, for example, the U.S. Army ran an Ebola bioweapons lab in the United States, where a monkey infected one of the scientists there. The strain turned out to be infectious only in monkeys, not humans, so the world dodged a bullet, but the U.S. Army “nuked” the entire facility with chemical bombs, killing all the monkeys and wiping out any last remnant of the virus on U.S. soil.You can read the full details of that incident in the book The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. We’ve also covered it at NaturalNews.com, where this book description is reprinted:In 1989, Reston, VA — one of the most famous U.S. planned communities located about 10 miles from Washington DC — stood at the epicenter of a potential biological disaster. This well-known story was narrated by Richard Preston in a bone chilling account related to the recognition and containment of a devastating tropical filovirus at a monkey facility — the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit.That outbreak occurred because Ebola was found to be spreading through the air ducts, confirming that Ebola can spread through the air. This simple fact was vigorously covered up by the entire medical establishment during the Ebola scare in the United States many years later, where the CDC transported an infected patient to a hospital in Dallas, subsequently infecting a nurse who was treated with highly toxic chemicals that caused permanent kidney damage (she later sued the hospital for the damage she suffered).The reason this is relevant is because in order to understand the coronavirus situation in China, we must first realize that virology research labs routinely experience lapses in containment. Even the United States has failed to contain deadly viral strains when trying to study them. China’s BSL-4 labs have experienced multiple accidental releases of SARS strains, and this new coronavirus is now confirmed to be an engineered strain that was either used in bioweapons research or vaccine experiments.The genomic coding in the virus is not natural, in other words. Just as you would never encounter a snake in the desert that’s writing a book containing words and grammatical structure, the genetic sequences now identified in the coronavirus strain are, without question, proof that human engineers have been tinkering with the strain.How to genetically engineer viruses: the pShuttle vectorOne of the tools used to accomplish this genetic engineering is called pShuttle. It’s a genetic tool set that can carry a payload of genes to be inserted into the target virus.Researchers engaged in genetic engineering can purchase the pShuttle sequence from online retailers such as AddGenes.org, which sells the sequence for $75, shipped in “bacteria as agar stab.”The following map outlines the complete gene sequence of the pShuttle tool:The method for using pShuttle is described in a PubMed document entitled, “A simplified system for generating recombinant adenoviruses.”The summary of the paper describes, “a strategy that simplifies the generation and production of such viruses.” Here’s how the process works to achieve genetic engineering of viruses:A recombinant adenoviral plasmid is generated with a minimum of enzymatic manipulations, using homologous recombination in bacteria rather than in eukaryotic cells. After transfections of such plasmids into a mammalian packaging cell line, viral production is conveniently followed with the aid of green fluorescent protein, encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone. Homogeneous viruses can be obtained from this procedure without plaque purification.The paper describes how this approach will, “expedite the process of generating and testing recombinant adenoviruses.”During this process, of course, the pShuttle leaves behind unique code, a “fingerprint” of the genetic modification. It is this fingerprint that has now been identified in the coronavirus.As revealed by genomics researcher James Lyons-Weiler in this bombshell analysis article, the pShuttle genetic code is found in the coronavirus that’s circulating in the wild.This is proof that the virus has been engineered by human scientists.“IPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378,” writes Lyons-Weiler for IPAK:Another gene sequence also shows a 92% match with the Spike protein from the SARS coronavirus:The process for achieving this was patented by Chinese researchers as shown in this patent link.The pShuttle vector was used to insert SARS genes into the coronavirus, a process that makes it deadly to humans. “The very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials,” warns Lyons-Weiler:The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.He also warns about, “studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals – rats, ferrets, and monkeys – in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus.”He concludes:If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.Brighteon.com/a4d2afed-56c6-4602-b6ab-6f777ba4a69aAnother doctor from Beijing Medical University warns the virus appears to be genetically engineeredLyons-Weiler is not alone in his assessment of the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus. Dr. Yuhong Dong, who holds a doctorate degree in infectious diseases from Beijing University, writes in The Epoch Times:Based on recently published scientific papers, this new coronavirus has unprecedented virologic features that suggest genetic engineering may have been involved in its creation. The virus presents with severe clinical features, thus it poses a huge threat to humans. It is imperative for scientists, physicians, and people all over the world, including governments and public health authorities, to make every effort to investigate this mysterious and suspicious virus in order to elucidate its origin and to protect the ultimate future of the human race.Dr. Yuhong reminds us that a Jan. 30 science paper published in The Lancet concludes that, “recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus.” In other words, this did not occur through natural mutations in the wild.He also points to a Jan. 27th study by five Greek scientists who also concluded the coronavirus has no lineage to other viruses in the “family tree” that’s found in the wild. He writes:A Jan. 27 2020, study by 5 Greek scientists analyzed the genetic relationships of 2019-nCoV and found that “the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus,” and has an unusual middle segment never seen before in any coronavirus. All this indicates that 2019-nCoV is a brand-new type of coronavirus. The study’s authors rejected the original hypothesis that 2019-nCoV originated from random natural mutations between different coronaviruses.“No bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market”Dr. Yuhong writes about The Lancet study by authors Roujian Lu et al., from the China Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, repeating a quote from that paper:First, the outbreak was first reported in late December 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV.In other words, it isn’t from bats.That means the entire mainstream media is lying to us about the real origins of the coronavirus.That same paper goes on to underscore the misinformation in the official explanation, stating, “Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases—27 of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another—were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere.”Both Lu (in The Lancet paper linked above) and Lyons-Weiler point to the presence of a SARS binding protein sequence in the coronavirus that allows it to easily infect human cells. As explained in The Epoch Times:…despite considerable genetics distance between the Wuhan CoV and the human-infecting SARS-CoV, and the overall low homology of the Wuhan CoV S-protein to that of SARS-CoV, the Wuhan CoV S-protein had several patches of sequences in the receptor binding (RBD) domain with a high homology to that of SARS-CoV. The residues at positions 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 in SARS-CoV S-protein were reported to be at receptor complex interface and considered critical for cross species and human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV. So to our surprise, despite replacing four out of five important interface amino acid residues, the Wuhan CoV S-protein was found to have a significant binding affinity to human ACE2. …The Wuhan CoV S-protein and SARS-CoV S-protein shared an almost identical 3-D structure in the RBD domain, thus maintaining similar van der Waals and electrostatic properties in the interaction interface. Thus the Wuhan CoV is still able to pose a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S protein–ACE2 binding pathway. (emphasis added)As Dr. Yuhong asks, “How could this novel virus be so intelligent as to mutate precisely at selected sites while preserving its binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor? How did the virus change just four amino acids of the S-protein? Did the virus know how to use Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) to make sure this would happen?”It couldn’t happen by chance, in other words. The coronavirus is not a random mutation in the wild. It was engineered.Many other scientists around the world are now investigating the gene sequences found in the coronavirus, and they are increasingly concluding that elements of the virus have been engineered.Many of those scientists are being threatened and censored. One paper has so far been forced to be withdrawn and revised, no doubt to remove the key conclusions that point to the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus, but the proof of its engineering cannot be denied forever.Brighteon.com/0bddc3da-f590-445e-ac38-9a74e358a57cEither the coronavirus was genetically engineered, or the science establishment is going to have to throw out the entire field of genomics research and claim it isn’t realEventually, the science establishment is either going to have to conclude that this coronavirus strain was engineered, or that all the laws of genetics science don’t work, and gene sequencing is imaginary (sort of like transgenderism by the “progressive” Left, which has already abandoned biological reality).So far they’ve tried to bamboozle the public into believing this is all some sort of accident from Mother Nature, but that has only worked because most of the public doesn’t understand enough science to counter the official propaganda. However, there are more than enough independent scientists around the world to prove that this pandemic strain was engineered by humans. More evidence is coming out each day.Interestingly, as this article is going to press, all the official numbers of infections and deaths from coronavirus have been frozen for about 14 hours and counting, almost as if every nation of the world has agreed to stop reporting new numbers. This may be a temporary situation that gets resolved in the next few hours, but it’s highly suspicious. For the last week, we’ve been getting new updates about every 12 hours or sooner, and we’ve never seen the count frozen for this long.At the same time, an 11th case of coronavirus has now been confirmed by the CDC in the United States, revealing that infections are continuing to spread in the USA, despite the efforts of the CDC to contain the outbreak.Stay informed.

"Can 5G exposure alter the structure and function of hemoglobin, causing coronavirus patients to die from oxygen deprivation?","(Natural News) Is 5G to partially blame for coronavirus deaths? Can 5G cause the blood that’s circulating in your body to be unable to carry oxygen?What’s especially horrifying about the critical care of coronavirus patients is that they aren’t suffering from “viral pneumonia,” but rather from an inability to absorb or carry oxygen in the blood.This has been confirmed by NYC ICU emergency physician Cameron Kyle-Sidell, who has released several videos detailing how coronavirus is not a kind of viral pneumonia. “We’re treating the wrong disease,” he says. And the ventilators are damaging the lungs of patients. He explains:COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one. Rather, it appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most resembling high altitude sickness. Is it as if tens of thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at 30,000 feet at the cabin pressure is slowly being let out. These patients are slowly being starved of oxygen.Watch him explain how coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen starvation, not from a viral pneumonia lung infection:What this emergency room physician makes clear is that coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen deprivation, not a classic scenario of viral pneumonia. The patients’ lungs work fine, in other words, and the ventilators are actually damaging their lungs by forcing excessive pressure into them.How does blood transport oxygen in the first place?How, exactly, can all these patients be starved of oxygen when their lungs are technically working just fine? To understand one possible answer, you have to first understand how the blood carries oxygen. It’s way more fascinating than you might have supposed.When functioning normally, 1 molecule of hemoglobin binds with 4 molecules of oxygen, using iron (Fe2+), forming oxyhemoglobin. But this binding is only achieved because of something called “partial pressure” which means the concentration of oxygen in the lung tissues is higher than the concentration of oxygen on the hemoglobin molecule (roughly stated, this is simplified somewhat), so the oxygen “leaps” to the hemoglobin in order to equalize the partial pressures across the chasm.Image source: QSstudy.comBut 5G radiation alters the porosity of cell membranes, allowing some molecules or ionic elements to move more easily across those members, displacing other molecules (or soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide) that might normally make that leap. For example, it is well documented that 5G radiation causes “Voltage Gated Ion Channels” (VGIC), specifically with calcium ions (VGCC), causing cellular toxicity due to too much calcium entering the cell walls and poisoning the cells.The research on this was published in Environmental Research — here’s the link — and reveals that 5G exposure not only alters cell permeability (porosity), but also releases peroxinitrites in the body. These are inflammation-producing molecules that ravage other healthy molecules circulating in the blood.As described by Natural News:A thorough review of the available published science on wireless (WiFi) and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) exposure has identified at least seven different ways that WiFi and EMF microwave pollution actively harms the human body.Published in the journal Environmental Research, the peer-reviewed paper explains that exposure to WiFi signals, which are everywhere these days, can lead to: oxidative stress, sperm and testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG (electroencephalogram) changes, apoptosis (programmed cell death), cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload.Note that coronavirus patients are already being observed with neuropsychiatric effects, testicular damage and oxidative stress, three of the symptoms of 5G exposure.We just created this simple chart to point out the similarities between 5G exposure and coronavirus symptoms. Feel free to share everywhere, and link back to this article if possible:Mass insanity due to psychiatric effects of cellular poisoningWe also know that 5G radiation and its effects on the cells of the body can lead to symptoms of insanity, hallucinations and even powerful personality changes. Interestingly, CNN’s Chris Cuomo already described bouts of hallucinations as he was battling the coronavirus, living in a high-5G city (NYC). As I wrote on Natural News last December:5G radiation causes “neuropsychiatric” effects through a mechanism described as ion potentiation poisoning of brain cells, according to research published in Environmental Research.This results in behavioral changes and even personality changes among those who are routinely exposed, researchers found. In other words, 5G is a weapon system that doubles as a telecommunications infrastructure, but the real impact is to damage human brain function and destroy rationality, reason and civility, especially among those who live in high population cities where 5G towers are becoming ubiquitous. That’s why you may have noticed increased insanity and widespread mental derangement in those areas.Part of this effect may also be due to the production of peroxynitrites, which are generated in the body’s cells upon exposure to the voltage emitted by 5G radiation, which is beamed at your body in a narrow cone of high-intensity energy. (5G antennae focus energy in a tight beam that follows you around.)We are already observing the coronavirus causing psychiatric effects, including zombie-like violent, aggressive behavior such as deliberately spitting and coughing on people.How 5G radiation exposure alters the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygenGetting back to the oxygen question, the answer to why 5G radiation exposure may alter the function of hemoglobin is found in understanding the protein structure of hemoglobin itself.Hemoglobin relies on something called the “heme group” which is a complex molecule with iron (FE 2+) in its center. This is surrounded by something called a “porphyrin ring” which is a cluster of unique structures (made of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen) that has a special affinity for other oxygen atoms. The ability for oxygen to “leap” onto this molecule in the lungs depends entirely on the structure (which also implies the ionic charges) of these complex molecules.One thing to note in all this is that without the presence of histidine, a special protein, this heme group would have higher affinity toward carbon monoxide than oxygen, meaning the entire heme group would be occupied by carbon monoxide, blocking the absorption of oxygen. Thus, the histidine presence is critical for allowing the heme group to bind with oxygen. If you mess with histidine, you end up forcing hemoglobin to carry CO instead of O2, effectively creating oxygen deprivation in the blood.This heme group, by the way, has special affinity for carbon dioxide, which allows the same molecule to carry CO2 out of the body’s cells and transport CO2 back to the lungs. Remember: The same hemoglobin molecule must carry both CO2 and O2 but at different times, and it must attract and then release those molecules at opposite times in order to rid the body of CO2 and nourish the body with O2. This is all accomplished with a delicate balance of proteins and protein folding.The hemoglobin molecule itself is a miracle of nanotechnology. It transmorphs into two different structural states based on whether it’s carrying oxygen or not. In what’s called the “R-state,” this molecule is like a magnet for oxygen. When four oxygen atoms are bound, it becomes a highly stable structure (and appears red). Technically, the binding of a single molecule of oxygen (O2) increases the affinity toward oxygen on the three other oxygen sites, making the hemoglobin “mop up” four oxygen molecules very quickly. When it lacks oxygen, it changes to a “T-state” and appears blue, which is why low-oxygen blood has a blue color.The important thing to understand in all this is that any alteration of the delicate structure of hemoglobin will impair its ability to bind with oxygen.Take a look at the hemoglobin molecule representation above, from APSUbiology.org, and note the heme groups which are positioned in four places across the molecule. The polypeptide chains are part of the transmorphing structure of the molecule that allows it to carry and release both CO2 and O2, depending on the partial pressures of the gasses at different locations in the body (lungs vs. other cells). Note carefully that any change in the structure of hemoglobin will cause it to stop functioning:Increasing the permeability of the hemoglobin molecule — i.e. its affinity toward other soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide — will “occupy” the hemoglobin molecule with the wrong substances, making it unable to absorb oxygen because it is not presenting in its “R-state” by the time the heart pumps the blood back to the lungs.Stated another way, anything that significantly alters the affinity of hemoglobin toward other soluble gasses (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or even ionic minerals in the blood) could “shut off” the ability of blood to carry oxygen by altering its atomic structure.If you change the structure of the heme group, it no longer functions to transport oxygen. Because in the case of the heme group, the structure is the function. Perhaps this can only be appreciated by organic chemists, but this heme group is truly a miracle of nanotechnology.Here’s a diagram of how iron, histidine, the heme group and O2 oxygen molecules interact with hemoglobin, which alters its structure depending on the “oxygenated” vs. “deoxygenated” forms: (via Biology.Kenyon.edu)Can 5G exposure alter the structure of hemoglobin by increasing its affinity toward other molecules which are not O2?The real question in all this is best phrased as I have asked it above. I doubt that we are dealing with a phenomenon where 5G radiation exposures blocks the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen, but rather occupies the hemoglobin molecule with other elements that alter its structure and therefore its function, inhibiting its ability to bind with oxygen.This is very likely happening all across the world wherever 5G is currently functioning, it’s just that the coronavirus is now exacerbating the symptoms and conditions to the point where mass death is occurring.In other words, the coronavirus pandemic would likely not be nearly as bad if 5G exposure / radiation pollution wasn’t already compromising the structure and function of hemoglobin cells in the bodies of people who live in 5G cities.This doesn’t mean the coronavirus isn’t real, of course; just that these two attacks on the human body have a synergistic effect of toxicity and mortality.Conclusion: Humanity is committing suicide with 5GWhile I strongly disagree with those who are claiming there’s no such thing as a virus or that the coronavirus is a hoax, I do agree that the widespread deployment of 5G antennas is a kind of suicide pact for the world.Just as the Romans built their aqueducts out of lead linings and thereby poisoned their own citizens, driving them insane with load poisoning, the modern world of Big Tech and telecommunications is mass poisoning humanity with electropollution.Right now, a lot of people are talking about the book, “The Invisible Rainbow” by John Kaminski, who believes coronavirus is an “electrical disease” and that 5G alone is causing all the mass deaths, not the virus. He writes things like, “The flu is not contagious” and “the quarantine is all a terrible hoax.”Surely he is wrong on those claims, but he may not be wrong at all about the toxicity of electropollution and how 5G is actually a kind of “suicide system” that’s destroying humanity.This all deserves a tremendous amount of additional study, but because we live in a world where Big Tech controls all the narratives and censors all those who question the safety of 5G, it now seems impossible for humanity to extricate itself from this mass suicide mission that has already been unleashed.And that doesn’t even cover the topic of vaccines. What if Bill Gates’ vaccines are being deliberately engineered to contain toxic substances that 5G exposure will push into the cells, causing widespread death from “binary” exposure and subsequent cell toxicity?It sure would be a simple way for Bill Gates to achieve his global depopulation dreams, all while administering a global IQ test that finds out which people are stupid enough to line up and be injected with a euthanasia weapon system.Watch my video here on how we can end this pandemic and end the lockdowns, too, by turning to nutrition and masks:Brighteon.com/bded5422-309d-48c7-859c-6de827faa8d7If you want to stay alive, read NaturalNews.com or Pandemic.news.",4/6/20 0:00,-32.60703704
"BREAKING: Researchers claim 100 percent cure rate vs. covid-19 in 100+ patient trial conducted in Ecuador, using intravenous chlorine dioxide","(Natural News) Preliminary data from a clinical trial involving more than 100 covid-19 patients in Ecuador has resulted in a claimed 100 cure rate within four days, according to Andreas Kalcker who is closely following the results of the effort. The tests were carried out by the Asociacion Ecuatoriana de Medicos Expertos en Medicina Integrativa, a group of integrative medicine practitioners.Ecuador has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus, and the current “standard of care” promoted by Western medicine — largely based on the use of ventilators — has been killing the vast majority of critical patients while utterly failing to address the real root of the problem.Covid-19 isn’t an Acute Respiratory Disease (ARD), it turns out. Rather, it often presents as an inflammation and blood clotting condition (see The Lancet research, below) which causes the blood to be unable to carry oxygen, resulting in patient hypoxia and eventual asphyxiation.This is why intravenous chlorine dioxide — which immediately delivers a high dose of oxygen to blood cells — is believed to work so effectively against covid-19. It reportedly restores the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and clears the clotting in the lungs, all while destroying pathogens.Chlorine dioxide researcher and advocate Andreas Kalcker has posted a video (in Spanish) where he explains the findings. That video, entitled, “Mas de 100 Casos de Covid-19 recuperados con CDS por medicos de Aememi,” is found at this link on Lbry.tv.A video embed is offered here:In the video, Andreas explains that researchers were able to achieve a complete cure in just four days through the use of intravenous chlorine dioxide (ClO2). Here’s a photo of some of the researchers holding syringes of chlorine dioxide, which is then infused into the patients’ blood, where it releases a wave of oxygen that researchers believe saturates the blood with O2 while killing pathogens:Another clinical trial involving chlorine dioxide is currently under way, documented by the US National Library of Medicine at ClinicalTrials.gov. The study uses oral chlorine dioxide (rather than intravenous) and is entitled, “Determination of the Effectiveness of Oral Chlorine Dioxide in the Treatment of COVID 19.” The trial is being conducted by the Genesis Foundation and involves 20 patients.The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for that trial is NCT04343742.Andreas Kalcker explains in his video that chlorine dioxide is a powerful disinfectant that destroys viruses and bacteria. The substance has long been used in water purification processes and is approved by various US government agencies for as a water treatment and purification agent.This video frame shows blood cells being flooded with oxygen from ClO2, instantly reducing clotting / coagulation:Covid-19 is not an acute respiratory diseaseIn another bombshell science paper published May 7, 2020, in The Lancet, researchers Dennis McGonagle and others determined that covid-19 is not a respiratory disease but rather “diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy,” a kind of blood clotting that presents in lung tissue.This explains why patients with covid-19 are dying from hypoxia (lack of oxygen) and are frequently killed by the use of ventilators. As an ICU doctor from New York warned months ago, doctors are treating the wrong disease. (That doctor’s YouTube channel was deleted and all his videos were censored, of course. No one is allowed to question medical orthodoxy in the medical police state known as the United States of America.)Study authors also found the inflammation triggers a worsening of the condition, which implies that anti-inflammatory interventions might be the key to saving lives and ending the pandemic. From the study:The immune mechanism underlying diffuse alveolar and pulmonary interstitial inflammation in COVID-19 involves a MAS-like state that triggers extensive immunothrombosis…MAS stands for Macrophage Activation Syndrome, and it is an inflammatory response stemming from an over-reactive immune response, similar to the “cytokine storm” that’s being widely discussed (which vitamin C helps prevent, according to published research). As the study explains:The severity of systemic inflammation in response to human coronavirus family members has features reminiscent of a cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), also known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH).Figure 1 from the study:To simplify these findings, covid-19 is not acute viral pneumonia impacting the respiratory system but rather an inflammation-based immunological response that leads to thrombosis (clotting in the lungs) which kills the patient. The use of ventilators only makes the problem worse, which is why previous observational studies have found that 88% of patients put on ventilators end up dying. They are dying because the ventilator treatment is the wrong treatment.Chlorine dioxide is reportedly saving 100 percent of the patients studied so far because chlorine dioxide floods the blood with instantly usable oxygen while killing the pathogens responsible for clotting. There is also anecdotal evidence that some people are beating covid-19 infections with high doses of aspirin, a blood thinner, although this information should not be taken as advice for treatment, and far more research is needed on blood thinners and anti-inflammatory interventions.This may also help explain why turmeric and vitamin D are associated with strong reductions in inflammation in the body, which may prove useful in balancing the immune response and preventing the kind of imbalance that can lead to immune system overreactions.The criminal medical cartels are censoring all treatments and cures that work to save livesNotably, the criminal Big Pharma cartels and corrupt government regulators (like the FDA, FTC, CDC) are going out of their way to try to criminalize or suppress any non-vaccine, non-pharma solutions that might save lives. Over the last month, we’ve all witnessed an astonishing level of aggression and mafia-style tactics used by the FDA and FTC against pioneering researchers offering a variety of possible solutions, from colloidal silver to chlorine dioxide and even intravenous vitamin C.They’ve even declared war on hydroxychloroquine and the medical establishment has been engineering clinical trials which are designed to fail from the start in order to discredit the off-patent, affordable drug.There is no doubt that Big Pharma’s obedient government lackeys are at war with truth and are desperately trying to suppress information about natural cures and integrative treatments that might eliminate covid-19 before vaccines can be made available.The techno-fascist tech giants like Facebook, Google, Vimeo, YouTube and Twitter are all-in with Big Pharma, going out of their way to censor and destroy all information that criticizes vaccines or offers wisdom about natural treatments or integrative medicine interventions. This criminal cabal of Big Tech and Big Pharma is the enemy of humanity, as they are deliberately working to worsen the pandemic, increase suffering and death and extend the punishing lockdowns for as long as possible in order to cause several economic damage while preparing the masses for mandatory vaccines.We are all witnessing a powerful criminal gang of corporations and regulators who are deliberately seeking to destroy human society as we know it today, and they are the gatekeepers of information on the ‘net (and in the news). This is why we are repeating our call for the CEOs of all the top tech giants to be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity, then prosecuted in a court of law. Over the weekend, a member of Italy’s Parliament gave a rousing speech in which she labeled Bill Gates a “vaccine criminal” and demanded he be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity.Such efforts should not be limited to Bill Gates, however. They must include the criminals of other tech giants as well as the corrupt, anti-human criminals running the FDA, FTC and CDC, among others. Their crimes against humanity must not go unanswered, and they must be held accountable in a court of law.The destructive, anti-human agendas of Big Pharma and Big Tech are incompatible with human freedom and a sustainable human civilization. These anti-human institutions must be permanently dismantled, and humanity must rise up against this threat in the same way we once awakened against the Third Reich and the rise of Nazi fascism and the Holocaust.Right now, Big Pharma, Big Tech, the FDA and the CDC are plotting to kill billions of human beings with an engineered bioweapon, a risky vaccine, and high-fatality prescription drugs that make people more vulnerable to covid-19. These enemies of humanity must be stopped, and the truth about chlorine dioxide must be set free so that human beings can be saved from suffering and death.To learn more about the establishment’s war on truth (and war on humanity), watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits, who has also been subjected to extreme censorship for raising the alarm about how vaccines are spreading infectious disease.Brighteon.com/be689f32-5526-4601-a627-48dc4f896cf9Stay informed by reading NaturalNews.com.",5/18/20 0:00,-22.03690909
CONFIRMED: CoVid-19 coronavirus found to contain unique “gain-of-function” property “for efficient spreading in the human population” … exact quote from science paper just published in Antiviral Resea,"(Natural News) We now have bombshell, smoking gun evidence that the CoVid-19 “Wuhan” coronavirus was specifically engineered as an offensive biological warfare weapon, designed to target to exterminate human beings.A new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Antiviral Research (Vol. 16, April 2020) is entitled, “The spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade.”It reveals that the CoVid-19 coronavirus contains unique features that allow it to function as a more efficient weapon system for human-to-human transmission, which helps explain why the virus has been impossible to contain (even under “quarantine” conditions, which have universally failed in China, Japan, Korea and elsewhere).As the science authors of the paper explain in the full text, “This furin-like cleavage site… may provide a gain-of-function to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population.” (Emphasis added)Further, the science paper finds that there is no known viral ancestry to the CoVid-19 coronavirus, meaning it did not evolve from nature. It was engineered, and the science paper authors also state that the virus contains elements from MERS, stating, “Before the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, this important feature was not observed in the lineage b of betacoronaviruses.”The abstract and full PDF (paid) of the study are available through this link at ScienceDirect.com:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220300528The “smoking gun” aspects of this research were brought to light earlier today by Prof. Frances Boyle who appeared on the Alex Jones Show (2nd broadcast hour, Feb. 19th, 2020, InfoWars.com) to reveal his findings that confirm the Wuhan coronavirus was an engineered biological weapon.Tomorrow we will publish the full transcript from that interview, containing stunning new details about the origin of the viral weapon. You can watch the full 47-minute segment here, via Brighteon.com. The full interview is also available on Banned.video.Brighteon.com/b4e196ff-d85f-45c4-b4e0-8bc1bea6dc09The following graphic from the published study shows some of the S-protein sequences found in the CoVid-19 “Wuhan” coronavirus which share a nearly identical pattern with MERS-CoV, but not with any previous ancestry of “lineage b” type coronavirus:The new feature engineered into the Wuhan coronavirus has, “the potential to cleave specifically viral envelope glycoproteins, thereby enhancing viral fusion with host cell membranes,” conclude study authors.This feature results in, “higher pathogenicity, pronounced neural symptoms and neurotropism in infected chickens,” according to the paper. That means, essentially, it kills more easily and causes nervous system damage while infecting nerve cells. Note that many of the human victims in China appear to suffer seizures and a total, almost instantaneous nervous system shutdown, literally collapsing in seconds.Furthermore, this enhanced property of the virus results in, “a widening of the cell tropism of the virus,” meaning it allows the virus to live and thrive in a much wider variety of human cells, including respiratory system cells. This means the virus lives in both respiratory cells and nerve cells.Interestingly, the study further confirms that “ACE2” receptors are the vector of opportunity for the virus to infect human beings, stating, “ACE2 is also the receptor of the newly emerged nCoV.”Additionally, the study finds that another element of the CoVid-19 virus appears to have been assembled from the SARS coronavirus, further confirming Frances Boyle’s claim that the engineered weapon is a “chimera” of multiple strains of biological weapons, including SARS, MERS and HIV. From the study: “Notably, the IFPs of the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are identical, displaying characteristics of viral fusion peptides (Fig. 2).”Engineered to attack the human respiratory system, but there may be a defense… (you won’t like it)The CoVid-19 coronavirus is specifically engineered to exploit the biology of the human respiratory system. Again, from the paper text:Since furin is highly expressed in lungs, an enveloped virus that infects the respiratory tract may successfully exploit this convertase to activate its surface glycoprotein (Bassi et al., 2017; Mbikay et al., 1997). Before the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, this important feature was not observed in the lineage b of betacoronaviruses.Finally, study authors explain that people who have already been exposed to other viral infections may have enhanced immunity against the coronavirus. From the study:…it was recently shown that in an effort to limit viral infections, host cells that are infected by a number of viruses provoke an interferon response to inhibit the enzymatic activity of furin-like enzymes.Although we caution that this supposition is just theory (so far), it may turn out that one way to boost defenses against the coronavirus could be to get infected with a weaker respiratory virus first. Stated another way, people who routinely interact with the public and are exposed to a wide variety of in-the-wild circulating viruses may be automatically building improved defenses by overcoming other viral infections first.This finding has huge implications for individuals who take vaccines, given that vaccines expose the human body to weakened viral strains that often fail to provoke the full response of “in-the-wild” viruses such as seasonal influenza. Although the research did not focus on this point, it might also turn out that people who routinely take seasonal flu shots could theoretically demonstrate a weakened immune response against the coronavirus, while those who avoid flu shots and allow their own bodies to naturally fight the flu each year will show enhanced immunity against CoVid-19 coronavirus.Or, arguably, it might work the other way around, where people who routinely take more vaccines and are exposed to a wider variety of weaker strains therefore have more capacity to produce an “interferon response.” It’s too early to tell, but it certainly seems to be the case that people who are rarely or never exposed to other viral pathogens may be far more vulnerable to this one.Refer to the “Hygiene Hypothesis” for more ideas on the ramifications of this research.There’s more research yet to come, and tomorrow we post the full transcript of the interview with Frances Boyle on the Alex Jones Show.We are about to launch Pandemic.news as a hub for podcasts, videos, science article links and news links, so be sure to check out that site over the next couple of days as we ramp it up.And yes, if you’re wondering how we managed to acquire Pandemic.news, we saw this coming years ago. None of what we’re seeing here today surprises us in the least.

What if the cure for the coronavirus were as simple as taking zinc?,"(Natural News) It’s now looking increasingly clear that zinc may truly be the “silver bullet” for stopping coronavirus infections and ending this global pandemic. This mineral is incredibly affordable, safe and widely available, yet no one in government or media is recommending that people take zinc, since it can’t generate the billions in profits found in prescription drugs and vaccines.This article isn’t a self-serving promotion, by the way. We don’t have any zinc products to sell. Rather, this article is about helping save lives using nutritional solutions that are available right now. While nothing is yet clinically proven to cure coronavirus — although chloroquine seems promising in several small trials — zinc now appears to be the most promising nutritional substance that could help end this global pandemic and get people back to work so that the economic collapse can be halted.Chloroquine works hand in hand with zinc, driving zinc into cellsThe combination of chloroquine and zinc appears to be especially potent. A study published in PLoS ONE is entitled, “Chloroquine is a Zinc Ionophore,” and it describes how chloroquine drives zinc into cancer cells, making those cells highly vulnerable to apoptosis (cell death of cancer cells). From the study:Chloroquine enhanced zinc uptake by A2780 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as assayed using a fluorescent zinc probe. This enhancement was attenuated by TPEN, a high affinity metal-binding compound, indicating the specificity of the zinc uptake.Although that study was focused on cancer cells, we also know that zinc blocks coronavirus RNA polymerase activity, which is what the coronavirus uses to replicate. This paper, published in another PLoS journal, specifically talks about “zinc ionophores” blocking the replication of coronavirus in cell cultures: “Zn(2+) inhibits coronavirus and arterivirus RNA polymerase activity in vitro and zinc ionophores block the replication of these viruses in cell culture.”From the abstract of that study:Increasing the intracellular Zn(2+) concentration with zinc-ionophores like pyrithione (PT) can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including poliovirus and influenza virus. For some viruses this effect has been attributed to interference with viral polyprotein processing. In this study we demonstrate that the combination of Zn(2+) and PT at low concentrations (2 µM Zn(2+) and 2 µM PT) inhibits the replication of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) in cell culture.More specifically, Zn(2+) was found to block the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis, whereas in the case of the SARS-CoV RdRp elongation was inhibited and template binding reduced. By chelating Zn(2+) with MgEDTA, the inhibitory effect of the divalent cation could be reversed, which provides a novel experimental tool for in vitro studies of the molecular details of nidovirus replication and transcription.So we know that chloroquine + zinc drives the zinc into cells, blocking coronavirus replication. This is published science, not just a random theory.It is very likely, in our estimation, that most of the people dying from coronavirus are zinc deficient. We need to be testing the zinc levels in blood serum of coronavirus patients so we can gather all relevant data and confirm this pattern.Symptoms of coronavirus infections almost perfectly mirror symptoms of zinc deficiencyWriting for LewRockwell.com, Bill Sardi writes that all the most prominent signs of COVID-19 almost perfectly mirror symptoms of zinc deficiency. From his article:…[M]odern medicine is so steeped in its pharmacy of prescription drugs, with its blinders toward nutritional medicine, that it can’t see the obvious evidences of a trace mineral deficiency that results in the same signs and symptoms produced by COVID-19 coronavirus.He publishes this list of COVID-19 symptoms vs. symptoms of zinc deficiency:He further writes:Dr. James Robb, a pathologist who performed early experiments with coronaviruses back in the 1970s, claims that zinc lozenges are the “silver bullet against coronavirus.”Zinc is required to maintain thymus gland function to produce life-long antibodies from T-memory cells.Zinc supplementation in the elderly, the high-risk group of coronavirus Infections, lowers illness markedly. Modern medicine needs to emphasize zinc therapy, especially during epidemics.In summary, it looks like zinc might be the single most important preventive measure, possibly in combination with chloroquine, to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and get the economies of the world back to work.And that’s why the tech giants (Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) as well as the corporate-run media will continue to censor all truth about zinc and chloroquine, because they actively hope to spread this pandemic and collapse the global economy.The best forms of zinc to consume as a dietary supplement are zinc gluconate, picolinate and acetate, by the way. Avoid zinc oxide, as it’s almost impossible to absorb.Beyond manufacturing medical masks and ventilators, we believe President Trump should order emergency production of zinc supplementation, making it widely available (perhaps at zero cost) to the entire population. This could substantially slow the spread of the virus and potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives in the USA alone.Stay informed. Read Pandemic.news.",3/30/20 0:00,-34.41
United Airlines preparing to segregate passengers who do not submit to rapid covid-19 testing,"(Natural News) United Airlines is getting ready to enact mandatory covid-19 testing for some of their airlines, to see how far they can push passengers into giving up their civil liberties. With this authoritarian move, the airline industry is participating in medical fascism, forcing medical decisions on passengers and stealing away human consent.The covid-19 testing kits have proven to be ineffective, providing both false negatives and false positives. The false negatives lead to a false sense of security, and the false positives allow authorities to suspend the civil liberties of healthy individuals only to bloat covid-19 statistics and report false outbreaks. This well-documented medical fraud is not relevant to health authorities because their power and authority is derived from compliance, not accurate data and scientific integrity. Compliance is all that matters when appeasing the hysterical fear that healthy people are spreading infections they do not have.People who don’t consent to rapid covid-19 test will be segregated, treated as lesser human beingsFrom November 16 to December 11, United Airlines will require all crew members and passengers over two years of age to submit to rapid covid-19 tests for United Flight 14 leaving out of Newark Liberty International Airport and traveling to London Heathrow. (EWR to LHR), departing at 7:15 p.m., Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.The tests will be free of charge. Anyone who does not consent to the testing requirement will be segregated from the rest of the passengers and put on a separate flight, as if they are “dangerous” vectors of disease.“We believe the ability to provide fast, same-day COVID-19 testing will play a vital role in safely reopening travel around the world and navigating quarantines and travel restrictions, particularly to key international destinations like London,” said Toby Enqvist, chief customer officer for United.Enqvist continued: “Through this pilot program, we’ll guarantee that everyone* onboard has tested negative for COVID-19, adding another element to our layered approach to safety. United will continue to lead on testing, while at the same time exploring new solutions that contribute to the safest travel experience possible.”United Airlines is trying to see how far the industry can push passengers into giving up their civil liberties, body autonomy and medical privacy before the airline industry goes all in with CommonPass.United Airlines negotiating with governments to give them more control over individual body requirementsCommonPass is a digital, medical fascist passport that will soon be required for travel. This digital passport, scanned at the terminal, gives governments the power to force travelers to submit to bodily requirements so public health authorities can monitor an individual’s covid-19 testing status and compliance to vaccines and other medical edicts.United Airlines is in the negotiating process with governments around the world to lift travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines. Both of these overzealous, authoritarian measures are being used improperly, not on sick individuals, but instead to suspend the liberties of healthy travelers who have no sign of infection.In order to get their liberties back, travelers will be coerced to comply with medical requirements pre-departure, and be forced to submit to all the bodily requirements put forth by each government, which will be monitored and scanned using the CommonPass digital passport. But because covid-19 tests are designed to always produce false positives, this stripping of human rights and body autonomy will continue, until all people are forced to take vaccines in order to make airlines “safe.” It’s all part of a plan, which Natural News reported on this past June 2020: Airline industry pushing for medical testing, thermal screening, digital IDs and vaccination passports.United Airlines is stripping human beings of informed consent and claiming ownership over their bodies. It started with mask mandates and it’s moving forward with faulty medical swabs – only to end with mandatory injections of experimental vaccines. Human beings are being turned into slaves of a totalitarian scientific dictatorship which continues to inflict mental, social and emotional trauma while coercing human compliance to bodily harm.Sources include:ZeroHedge.comTheLancet.comNaturalNews.comNaturalNews.com",11/1/20 0:00,-36.61032258
China is using the coronavirus pandemic to speed up its plans for global DOMINATION,"(Natural News) A U.K. minister of parliament party warning that the Chinese Communist Party will achieve global dominance sooner thanks to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). This warning was written by Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader of the Conservative Party.In an op-ed in The Telegraph regarding China’s rising prominence, Duncan Smith lamented the fact that, while China was supposedly on the road to recovery, the U.K. was getting ready to reimpose strict lockdowns across swathes of their country.The MP further noted that the U.K. isn’t alone in this regard. The coronavirus continues to wreak havoc across most of the developed world, particularly in Europe and the United States.China has been a notable exception to this rule. If their official pronouncements are to be believed, they haven’t had to deal with a large-scale resurgence of the coronavirus in a very long time. (Related: Beijing using the coronavirus pandemic to expand internet surveillance apparatus.)In fact, as many economies in the Western world are going through a recession, China just announced that its GDP grew by 4.9 percent in the third quarter, and analysts expect the country’s economy to grow by 7.6 percent in 2021.“There is a deep sense of irony here,” wrote Duncan Smith. “The country from which coronavirus came, and which did so little in the early days to help the rest of the world escape its spread, is now bouncing back by selling us the equipment we need to combat that very virus.”China set to dominate the world through tradeDespite predictions that the coronavirus pandemic – coupled with the ongoing trade war with the United States – would finally shatter China’s economy, the communist regime is still standing strong.In the first two months of 2020, Chinese exports contracted by an astonishing 17.1 percent. However, As the coronavirus pandemic started spreading across the world and demand for medical equipment, personal protective gear and appliances for people to start working from home such as computers and smartphones increased, Chinese exports received an enormous boost.Duncan Smith points out that the pandemic has given China a trade surplus of $58.93 billion. The country’s exports have been increasing since June, and the yuan – China’s currency – hit an 18-month high before the communist government intervened to keep it more stable.Many investors in the West are once again lining up and give the communist regime more of their money. In the United States, investors just gave the regime $27 billion in China’s first U.S. direct investment bond. Foreign Direct Investment inflows now amount to around $103 billion.“China’s export performance during the crisis is indeed proof of its solid status as the world’s factory,” said Yao Wei, a Chinese economist for French investment bank Societe Generale. “It is reliable, as the quick and effective containment of the outbreak in China allowed its manufacturing sector to resume operations way ahead of others.”Economic warfare is not the only way China is achieving its global dominance. Within its own borders, Uighurs are being forced into reeducation camps to have their cultural identities extinguished, Tibetans are being forced into labor camps, Mongolians are being barred from learning their own language, and its democracy-loving subjects in Hong Kong are facing persecution.Outside its borders, it is currently engaged in a tense struggle with India over their borders in the Himalayas region, and it continues to solidify its grip over the resource-rich South China Sea. All this is not even considering the military threats it makes against democratic Taiwan.The Free World can still fight back against China’s riseThere is a chance for the rest of the Free World to catch up. China has lost much of its early trade advantage as soon as lockdowns started getting rolled back in its rival trading partners. Chi Lo, a Greater China economist for BNP Paribas, believes that China’s export growth can fade as soon as world production goes back up to normal levels.The strength of its growth is already being challenged by geopolitical tensions. When the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co., the country had to increase its imports from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.For China’s emerging global dominance to be properly counteracted, however, Duncan Smith says the Western world needs to act quickly. To do that, it needs to stop pouring money into the country. If countries like the U.K. and the U.S. continue to do so, they may one day find themselves “ever more dependent on this authoritarian regime.”Chinese President Xi Jinping has a clear vision for the future of his country, said Duncan Smith.

"WHO: Lockdowns not the primary method for fighting COVID-19, governments must develop “better systems” against pandemic","(Natural News) An increasing number of doctors and other health professionals and experts, including members of the World Health Organization (WHO), are joining the call to warn policymakers against reimposing restrictive lockdowns. These medical professionals argue that the lockdowns do more harm than good in the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).During an interview with The Spectator aired on Oct. 9, WHO doctor and special envoy on COVID-19 David Nabarro said that the WHO no longer advocates using lockdowns as a primary means of keeping the coronavirus under control.WATCH: Dr David Nabarro, the WHO's Special Envoy on Covid-19, tells Andrew Neil: 'We really do appeal to all world leaders: stop using lockdown as your primary control method'. Watch the full interview here: https://t.co/XLdaedsKVS #SpectatorTV @afneil | @davidnabarro pic.twitter.com/1M4xf3VnXQ — The Spectator (@spectator) October 9, 2020“The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted,” said Nabarro during the online interview. “But by and large, we’d rather not do it.”In an appeal to world leaders, Nabarro said that they need to stop using coronavirus lockdowns as their primary method of controlling the pandemic. “Develop better systems for [controlling the virus],” he said. “Work together and learn from each other. But remember – lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer.” (Related: No, “coronavirus” hasn’t thrown 100 million into extreme poverty… virus LOCKDOWNS did that.)“I want to say it again: We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means of controlling this virus.”Nabarro: War on COVID-19 will not be won by controlling peopleIn a different interview, this time with BBC 4, Nabarro warned the U.K. government against imposing another strict coronavirus lockdown. The WHO doctor argued that for the lockdown to work, the restrictions on social and economic activity cannot be forced upon the British people. These policies need to be popularly supported.“This war – and I think it’s reasonable to call it a war – against the virus, which is going to go on for the foreseeable future, is not going to be won by creating tougher rules that attempt to control people’s behavior,” said Nabarro. “The only way that we will come out ahead of this virus is if we’re all able to do the right thing in the right place at the right time because we choose to do it.”Nabarro believes that, without making it mandatory, people will one day come together and realize the importance of social distancing, the wearing of face masks, personal hygiene and quarantining when they get flu-like symptoms.Nabarro’s current position on coronavirus lockdowns represents a radical shift from his previous statements. He has previously advocated for lockdowns. However, by September, he had moved to a more neutral position, arguing in front of the British parliament that the world was still at the beginning stages of the pandemic and that it will still take some time for health experts to properly understand how to fight it. By this point, he was arguing that lockdowns should not be discounted as a tactic.However, in recent weeks, he said he has become “more and more convinced” that, despite the possible benefits to defeating the spread of the coronavirus, the economic and social consequences were too much for the world to bear.Watch this episode of Brighteon Conversations with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he talks to Dr. Sherri Tenpenny as they both sound off against the stupidity of making the wearing of face masks mandatory.There are alternatives to continual lockdownsTo understand the right way to fight back against the coronavirus, Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, says leaders should look to the example of countries that have successfully defeated it, such as Vietnam, Taiwan and New Zealand.In Taiwan and New Zealand, sporting events are being held without any restrictions. In Vietnam, people can enter packed cafes and restaurants without fear.In Vietnam and New Zealand, coronavirus lockdowns were decisive and quick. In Taiwan, a large-scale lockdown was never imposed upon the people. Yet, between these three countries, only 67 people have died from the coronavirus so far.Sridhar has identified three key policies that governments need to put in place.First, there needs to be an effective system for testing, tracing and isolating. Test results need to be returned within 24 hours to minimize the damage one person can do. There must be a proper system for contact tracing, with the goal of reaching at least 80 percent of a positive person’s recent contacts. People who test positive must also be isolated for at least 14 days, either at their own homes or at designated shelters.Second, national health authorities need to act rationally and communicate their policies clearly, emphasizing encouraging personal hygiene and the wearing of face masks (without mandating it) and avoiding leaving the house as much as possible.Lastly, governments need strict border protection. The coronavirus can be imported from overseas, and only strong border policies will be able to prevent that.Learn more about the rational, science-based approached to fighting back against the coronavirus by reading the latest articles at Pandemic.news.Sources include:TheEpochTimes.comExpress.co.ukTheGuardian.com",11/1/20 0:00,-5.387115385
Top 5 Ways to HEIGHTEN your chances of catching Covid-19,"(Natural News) The science is in, and if you’re not already pretty much dying from cancer, diabetes or heart disease, then you probably aren’t going to die if you catch Covid-19. If you subtract all the deaths that were labeled Covid-caused that were not caused by Covid, what you’re left with is another viral flu, that went viral all around the world, killing off the already sick and dying. There’s no number we’ll ever see statistically that’s accurate, but many people who were labeled Covid death victims really died from MRSA, pneumonia, the flu, cancer, diabetes, heart attacks, strokes and of course, suicide. Yes, you can blame the fake news press for those. Wait, there’s more.Besides all of those victims and non-victims of Covid, we are all told to think of the others, to be safe and wear a homemade bandana mask everywhere, maintain social distance of exactly 6 feet at all times, and only gather together if rioting in the streets to declare our hatred of Donald J. Trump. Otherwise, stay home, go broke and beg (vote) for a government that gives you everything for free, while removing forever all of your Constitutional rights.It’s rather ironic that there’s “no cure” for a virus that can be killed by hand sanitizer and regular soap. In this rush to return to “normal” we should all consider very carefully what parts of normal we’re rushing back to. Nobody anywhere seems to have any common sense whatsoever. They’re acting like they’re being totally safe on one end, and on the other, the virus is having a free-for-all, penetrating the magical force field everyone thinks they’ve got erected. Like, don’t bring your own bag to the grocery store, but then the clerk touches every single item you just touched to put in the cart.Think about this for a minute. There are 200 million Americans who get the flu shot every year, and get juiced up accordingly with deadly, brain-numbing mercury all the while. That’s just the beginning of why most people have zero common sense. Then, they eat what they see advertised on TV and the internet, with no regard to actual nutritional content or food that’s free from chemical herbicides and insecticides (plus GMOs). We’re talking about weed killer and bug killer chemicals that eviscerate the human immune system, repeatedly every single meal, snack and soda.After a few years of that, they’re bound for their M.D.’s office, where they’re carefully and so thoughtfully prescribed chemical medications that solve nothing, except to quell the symptoms of a deep-rooted disease that’s festering in the gut, soon to travel through the lymph fluid to everywhere vital in the body. Those laboratory-concocted medications often come in the form of antibiotics, that wipe out all gut bacteria (good and bad), setting up the patient for death from a viral infection, like Covid, the flu, or certain kinds of MRSA staph-bacteria that are totally immune to antibiotics.And, there’s more.Filthy, bacteria-laden Covid masks are bad, bad newsThe Covid masks everybody wears become filthy after a few days, trapping bacteria from the mouth and lungs in the body and in the material of the mask. Who’s washing these bacteria nets regularly, and who even realizes that the Covid virus is only 2 microns in size, where the holes in most masks are 3 to 5 microns. That’s like throwing a tennis ball through a basketball hoop. The masks don’t even work, in fact, they’re just delivering a cozy-safe feeling that enables more people to expose themselves even more. Oops.In fact, according to a recent, in-depth study of Covid mask effectiveness, the penetration of cloth masks by particles was above 96 percent, compared to 44 percent with medical masks. That means not even medical masks are all that safe, let alone these crappy home-made, double-ply cut up sheets, scarves and ‘neck gaiters’ people are all wearing. And then they touch the mask repeatedly every minute to adjust it, rendering it not just useless, but now dangerous as well. There goes that safety net. It’s now a bacteria net.The whole social distancing thing is a sham too. Also ironic is the fact that every vaccine pusher and fanatic has screamed for decades about herd immunity and how we should all stick together to help build immunity, but now everyone’s on lock down, where they don’t even get fresh air and exposure to bacteria they need to build immunity. It’s all backwards and inside out, just like the Democrats want it (yes, it’s political too, mainly actually).The worst part of the whole mental “pandemic” is that the 200 million idiots who get a flu shot every year don’t know a darned thing about supplements, herbs, tinctures, superfoods, clean food or highly effective indigenous medicine. Their quack M.D.s warn them about natural remedies. They discourage them. It’s all about slash and burn allopathic nightmares that only stave off the inevitable. Surgery, tests, more tests, then chemotherapy and radiation. It’s “your best chance,” they say. At what? Dying from Covid?Without further adieu, here are the Top 5 Ways to literally INCREASE your chances of catching Covid-19#1. If you’re dumb enough to get a flu shot (or any CDC-recommended dirty vaccines for that matter)#2. If you’re dumb enough to eat genetically modified food most meals (and processed sugar/canola oil)#3. If your doctor cons you into taking antibiotic prescriptions for a viral infection#4. If you think wearing is mask and social distancing is valid protection#5.

Airlines and transport officials CLASH with CDC over quarantines for airline passengers,"(Natural News) Airline companies and U.S. transport officials are clashing with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding whether people who test negative for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) should still be forced to quarantine after they arrive in the U.S.Currently, official guidelines state that U.S. residents returning from Europe are advised – but not forced – to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return to the United States. European travelers are generally denied entry. Alternatively, Americans are barred from traveling to most European countries, with the notable exception being the United Kingdom, which forces them to quarantine for 14 days upon their arrival.These guidelines are now being questioned as airlines, industry groups and senior transport officials look to strike deals with other nations and airline companies to establish what is known as a “safe-travel corridor.” This would involve two connected locations where people can fly to and from without needing to quarantine upon arrival.CDC wants to maintain quarantines, but shorten their lengthThe CDC s arguing that, even if a safe-travel corridor was established between two cities, people should still be required to quarantine. That said, they’ve relented somewhat, and now only want to mandate that travelers be quarantined for between five to seven days, rather than 14. After the self-isolation period, however, the CDC still wants these travelers to take another coronavirus test.Industry groups and senior transport officials, on the other hand, are pushing back on the need for further quarantining and testing.“Quarantines don’t help achieve the goal of safe travel,” said industry group Airlines for America in a statement. “Rather, quarantines simply stop people from traveling or are not complied with.” (Related: In order to travel, you’ll soon be forced to carry a digital certificate that provides proof of medical checkups, screenings, DNA swabs, vaccinations.)Airlines and other industry groups are pushing for an alternative system where travelers will be tested for the coronavirus before departure and will be signed up for a contact tracing system. One airline trade group is supportive of a 24-hour isolation period.Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC’s division of global migration and quarantine, is one of the loudest voices calling for a one-week quarantine upon arrival. This, Cetron argues, would give the U.S. a 90 percent assurance that travelers will be coronavirus-free.Despite his opposition to more relaxed rules for travelers, Cetron has nonetheless voiced his support for the establishment of a safe-travel corridor. He believes that it may one day contribute “to a safe, responsible and healthy global air travel experience, in addition to testing before and after travel and following public health recommendations on self-quarantine after travel.”Discussions with the CDC are ongoing, and senior transport officials are attempting to mediate the dispute and find a common ground between the two parties.Transport officials are hoping to resolve the disagreement very soon, as both the United States and the United Kingdom are currently in talks to establish a safe-travel corridor between London and New York. Officials from the Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security hope to open the corridor by the winter holidays.Study suggests flying safer than grocery shopping or dining in restaurantsThe CDC’s apprehensions with allowing the establishment of safe-travel corridors may be unfounded. A study released on Tuesday by the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health strongly suggests that flying may be safer than grocery shopping or dining indoors.Researchers created computer models to simulate airflow in airliner cabins. According to them, the specialized onboard ventilation systems – known as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters – are able to filter out 99 percent of airborne particles, including those bearing viruses.The researchers argued that, even if an airplane’s ventilation systems sucked in particles with COVID-19, the fact that they go through HEPA filters and because of the “downward direction” of airflow makes it unlikely a passenger will infect others.“This ventilation effectively counters the proximity travelers are subject to during flights,” wrote the researchers in their report.That said, the report also says that ventilation systems alone cannot guarantee a 99 percent reduction in risk. Effective air ventilation needs to be coupled with the wearing of face masks, regular disinfection and passenger screening for COVID-19 symptoms.This “layered approach” makes flying safer than other routine activities, such as dining indoors in restaurants and grocery shopping.The airline industry is already interpreting the study as a sign of relief, as they continue to face devastating losses from the pandemic and the lockdowns around the world making air travel impossible. Executives from United Airlines have already called the pandemic “the worst crisis in the history of aviation.”The study is in line with another study conducted by the Department of Defense, who put particle detection equipment and mannequins wearing face masks on Boeing 767 and 777 aircraft. They found little risk of transmission, thanks in no small part to the efficient ventilation of air in the planes.Learn more about how businesses, particularly the airline industry, are struggling to recover from the economically devastating lockdowns by reading the latest articles at Pandemic.news.Sources include:WSJ.comTravelAndLeisure.comFoxBusiness.comEdition.CNN.com",10/31/20 0:00,-9.693773585
Big Tech now censoring all posts that question face coverings,"(Natural News) At the request of Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), the three major tech platforms – Facebook, Google and Twitter – will now be censoring all posts and content that questions the safety and effectiveness of the almighty face mask.A full-fledged believer in the power of face masks to cure the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), Duckworth wants Big Tech to “counter domestic disinformation that spreads the dangerous lies such as ‘masks don’t work’” by preventing it from being shared online.In other words, face masks are so safe and effective, according to Duckworth, that people cannot be allowed to express any free speech to the contrary because it might deter people from putting their faith in the religion of COVID-19.Duckworth’s attack on the First Amendment comes as Silicon Valley faces yet another meaningless grilling from Congress over the immunity protections it still maintains under Section 230 of the antiquated Communications Decency Act (CDA).Congress continues to pretend as though it will eventually do something to curb Big Tech from infringing people’s rights, but so far it has been all talk and no action, also known as business as usual, from the political overlords.Sen. Rick Scott (R-Ill.) put on a lively show, however, as he sparred with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey concerning the platform’s unfair treatment of conservatives. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) also joined in on the fun by yelling at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.“Who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear?” Cruz bellowed during the virtual hearing over Zoom.“We don’t have a general policy around misleading information and misinformation,” Dorsey responded. “We rely upon people calling that speech out.”In other words, Twitter does not actually have a standardized set of rules for what it censors, but rather relies on mob rule to make censorship decisions.Is it really realistic to expect that Congress will ever put an end to Big Tech censorship?President Donald Trump is also riling up his base about the topic by tweeting about it, ironically. Trump wrote in an Oct. 28 tweet that the media and Big Tech “are not covering Biden Corruption.Trump added that the United States no longer has “Freedom of the Press,” but rather “Suppression of the Story, or just plain Fake News.”“So much has been learned in the last two weeks about how corrupt our Media is, and now Big Tech, maybe [sic] even worse. Repeal Section 230!”Again, we will believe it when we see it because this has been getting talked about for years by Republicans, which have collectively and individually done a whole lot of nothing to punish the tech giants for violating the First Amendment.The Department of Justice (DOJ) did recently file an antitrust lawsuit against Google, however, the subject of that suit is monopolistic, anticompetitive behavior as opposed to censorship.When asked during the hearing if he plans to censor content on Facebook post-election that encourages violence, Mark Zuckerberg made the claim that “there are no exceptions” to its censorship rules, even if politicians break them.“The three witnesses we have before this committee collectively pose, I believe, the single greatest threat to free speech in America and the greatest threat we have to free and fair elections,” Cruz went on to declare during the circus event.Dorsey reluctantly responded to Cruz’s statements by suggesting that Twitter does “need to earn more trust” from the public, adding that “more accountability is needed” to create the illusion that Twitter supports free speech.More related news about the scourge of Big Tech censorship and the elimination of the First Amendment in America, be sure to check out Censorship.news.Sources for this article include:ZeroHedge.comNaturalNews.com",10/30/20 0:00,3.128125
Those who call the coronavirus a “hoax” are making a huge mistake: These twelve questions reveal the TRUTH that no one dare utter,"(Natural News) There’s no question that elements of the coronavirus pandemic are being wildly exaggerated by mostly left-leaning mayors, governors and media pundits in order to punish America with economically destructive lockdowns (all in the hope of removing Trump from office, it turns out). We’ve even documented one of the most egregious deception efforts involving the Florida Dept. of Health, which has been rigging lab reports to claim 100% of those tested are “positive” for covid-19.But it’s a mistake to leap to the conclusion that because left-wing operators hope to exaggerate the infections, hospitalizations and deaths that therefore the entire pandemic is a complete hoax and no one is dying from the coronavirus. That’s where the thinking is dangerously misguided and is already leading to complacency. Yet the idea that the entire coronavirus pandemic might be a hoax is a seductive one, especially on alternative platforms or conservative media, where it’s convenient to explain away all the economic damage as stemming from an elaborate hoax rather than to understand the complexities of a real pandemic augmented by fake news from the Left.From Brighteon.com videos to InfoWars broadcasts, we repeatedly hear many people in independent media claiming the coronavirus is a “hoax.” There is no virus, they say, and all the infections, hospitalizations and deaths have all been faked, they claim. It’s all a grand, global theatrical production involving hundreds of thousands of nurses, doctors and coroners, all to trick the world into lockdowns that have no real justification, they tell us. This has become the dominant narrative in alt media.But if that’s true, then how can there be a media cover-up regarding hydroxychloroquine, an off-patent, low-cost drug that successfully treats and cures coronavirus patients? If there’s no coronavirus, then what is hydroxychloroquine treating?It’s easy to find reports of deaths being improperly attributed to covid-19, or even stories of false positives incorrectly flagging people with covid-19 when they really don’t have it. But the logic leap that many in the alternative media have taken is assuming that since some deaths were faked, therefore ALL deaths must have been faked.Many of the same independent media sources that are reporting the coronavirus to be a “hoax” also reported on how Obama’s NIH, under Dr. Fauci, directed millions of dollars to the Wuhan virology lab to fund “gain-of-function” research. If the coronavirus is a hoax, and there is no coronavirus, then isn’t the Obama / Fauci / NIH story also completely bogus?In fact, there are at least a dozen serious questions or contradictions that those who claim the coronavirus is a hoax can’t answer. Much of their reporting has been self-contradicting to the point where believing their news requires that you alternatively embrace the existence of the virus or denounce the virus as fake… depending on the day of the week.But the coronavirus can’t be real on Monday, fake on Tuesday, real again on Wednesday and so on. Any explanation of coronavirus-related observations must, above all, deliver consistency. Unless, of course, you believe in transviralism, where viruses can magically pop into existence as easily as a biological man claiming he’s a woman so he can compete on the women’s college wrestling team.For the record, we have consistently understood the coronavirus to be a very real threat, and we haven’t wavered from day one. While we acknowledge that much of the coronavirus testing is highly inaccurate — and hundreds of testing facilities seem to be deliberately finding all test to be “positive” in their results — even all that fraud doesn’t mean the coronavirus isn’t really impacting other people.These questions and contradictions must be addressed by anyone who wants to be taken seriouslyIn watching the coverage of this issue by others, we’ve noticed twelve questions or contradictions that have repeatedly surfaced. See the full list below, and ask yourself this important question as you read through the list: Do logic and reason still apply in our universe?Just as the radical Left claims biological sex doesn’t exist and a man can become a woman at any moment by making a wish, much of the conservative, independent media has an eerily similar view about the coronavirus, alternately claiming it’s either real or fake depending on what story they want to cover on that particular day.Obviously, men can’t become women, and men can’t have babies. In the same way, the coronavirus can’t be both real and fake at the same time. So which is it?Read the questions and decide for yourself:Twelve questions for those who claim the coronavirus is a hoaxQuestion #1) Many in the alternative media reported on the New York City nurse who filmed undercover video and blew the whistle on how NYC hospitals were killing patients by rooming non-infected patients with coronavirus-infected patients, allowing transmission to occur. But how can non-infected patients be killed by the coronavirus if the coronavirus is a hoax?Question #2) Alternative media outlets that are currently reporting the coronavirus to be a “hoax” are also reporting on how the mainstream media lied and covered up the story of how hydroxychloroquine can effectively and affordably treat coronavirus patients. If the coronavirus is a hoax, then what exactly is hydroxychloroquine treating, then?Question #3) Many in the independent media are now pushing “mask hysteria” and claiming that wearing a mask causes death by asphyxiation or carbon dioxide poisoning. Yet Asian cultures — Taiwan, Japan, China, Korea, Singapore, etc. — have been wearing masks in public for decades, without a single recorded event of someone dying from wearing a mask. Surgeons wear masks during surgery without passing out, and masks are routinely worn by construction workers to filter particular matter such as sawdust, drywall dust and paint. If these masks have been safe and effective for more than fifty years, how did masks suddenly and magically become deadly and toxic in the last three months? Did the laws of physics change?Question #4) Coronavirus pandemic skeptics claim all the infections and deaths are faked. But if all the deaths are faked, then why did those who are faking the deaths decide to keep dropping the daily death numbers from mid April through the end of June? If they’re faking all the deaths, then wouldn’t they want to keep faking more and more of them to make the pandemic look worse and worse? Why would they fake fewer deaths over time?Question #5) Many independent media outlets that originally reported the coronavirus was a “genetically engineered biological weapon” designed to depopulate the planet are now reporting it’s all a hoax. But then they simultaneously report that Obama’s NIH, under Dr. Fauci, directed money to the Wuhan virology lab that built the weapon in the first place. If the coronavirus is a hoax, then there’s no story about Obama and Fauci funding a biological weapon “gain of function” program in China. How can both be true?Question #6) In June, it was widely reported across the independent media that coronavirus infections caused the body’s cells to “sprout tentacles” that allowed the virus to attack adjacent cells and infect them. This was widely reported as more evidence that the virus was a genetically engineered biological weapon. As an example of the coverage, Zero Hedge reported:“There are long strings that poke holes in other cells and the virus passes through the tube from cell to cell,” said UCSF’s Director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute, Professor Nevan Krogan. “Our hypothesis is that these speed up infection.”So how can the coronavirus sprout “tentacles” if it doesn’t exist and is a total hoax?Question #7: As Gary Heaven recently wrote in a Natural News article about coronavirus treatments that work, the common inhaler anti-inflammatory drug budesonide works extremely well to treat and cure covid-19 infections. A well-known doctor, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has been actively promoting the treatment as an alternative to expensive Big Pharma drugs and vaccines, proving that he’s not a pawn of the drug cartels:If budesonide successfully treats patients who have covid-19, curing them and allowing them to leave the hospital and return to normal life, then what is budesonide treating if the coronavirus is a hoax? How can anyone simultaneously claim the coronavirus is a hoax and also claim the media is suppressing cures that work to treat it?Question #8) Coronavirus skeptics explain that coronavirus deaths are faked in the United States because hospitals receive extra funding for every death that’s considered coronavirus-related. Thus, people who die from other causes are said to have died from coronavirus so that hospitals can receive extra funds from Medicare. But Medicare doesn’t pay hospitals in Italy, Brazil, Mexico or Russia, and the same financial incentives don’t exist in most countries. So how do you explain all the dead bodies in Guayaquil, Ecuador? Or the skyrocketing death rates in Brazil? Or the massive die-offs in Italy, where it would have been impossible to recruit thousands of doctors and nurses to participate in a grand false flag theatrical production?Question #9) If the initial lockdowns didn’t work, then why did coronavirus daily deaths plummet soon after the lockdowns went into effect? And why are coronavirus deaths now beginning to surge back a few weeks after the lockdowns were relaxed? If the doctors, nurses, hospitals and coroners wanted to fake all the deaths, wouldn’t they want to keep faking more deaths, not fewer deaths?Question #10) For months, we’ve been told by the independent media that “fear” is the problem, and that those talking about coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths were “pushing fear.” They said things like, “We need to flatten the fear curve,” and urged complete calm for everyone. Not long after, they turned around the told everybody you should be terrified of masks. So if “fear” is the enemy here, then why push fear about masks? Will all these same media pundits also tell us that children shouldn’t wear masks this Halloween and claim that children will drop dead all across America if they put on masks?Question #11) If the coronavirus isn’t real, then why are many publishers who claim the pandemic is a “hoax” also telling people to take vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc and anti-viral supplements? Obviously, if the pandemic is fake, there’s no need to protect yourself from it. So why recommend immune-boosting supplements in the first place?Question #12) If masks are so dangerous and kill people, then why are so many pro-liberty people perfectly fine with wearing Guy Fawkes masks? What about Halloween masks?If we are to deal with the very real coronavirus pandemic — which was deliberately set into motion by China, using a genetically engineered virus that was clearly weaponized to kill human beings — we must have the critical thinking skills to filter out the fake news exaggerations without succumbing to an emotional knee-jerk reaction of declaring the entire thing doesn’t exist.Daily deaths in the United States are now on the upswing, with Texas achieving an all-time record high in daily deaths just yesterday. Even if the infection testing is obviously bogus, how do you account for the sharp increase in deaths? And if your answer is that “all the deaths are being faked,” then you have to ask yourself why Texas wasn’t faking just as many deaths in April, May and June. Why suddenly in the middle of July? Texas isn’t a “pro-lockdown” state, either.Then again, the result of the complacency wasn’t difficult to see coming. Back in April, I publicly predicted that June and July would be “complacency” months, followed by a second wave in August if people didn’t take this pandemic seriously.Even though the Case Fatality Rate appears to be slowly dropping, rising complacency is exposing so many people to the infections that daily deaths are on track to continue rising for quite some time.It now looks like August and September and on track to see a sharp surge in hospitalizations and deaths, even as mostly conservative publishers continue to claim the coronavirus isn’t even real.Refrigerated trucks brought into Texas and Arizona to deal with all the dead bodies“Texas and Arizona are bringing in refrigerated trucks to expand morgue capacity in several counties across each state, after the number of coronavirus fatalities shattered records this week,” reports Fox News. “Reuters reported that San Antonio and Bexar County each received five refrigerated trailers to store up to 180 bodies as some hospital morgues and funeral homes have reached capacity.”Is this all staged, too? Does anyone seriously believe counties and cities in Texas are faking refrigerated trucks as some sort of elaborate theater to make a grand hoax more convincing?And if the number of deaths occurring in these places were simply “normal,” then the morgues wouldn’t be overrun in the first place. So no, this isn’t just people dying from regular causes magically being switched and labeled as “covid-19 deaths.”Clearly, more people are dying than usual. Via Fox News:The Office of the Medical Examiner said it is currently at 63 percent morgue capacity but has brought in 14 cold storage containers– eight being held at the County facility and six more in reserve– that would allow an additional 294 decedents by the end of next week “if necessary,” Fields Moseley, a spokesperson for Maricopa County, told Fox News.“We know some funeral homes are already at capacity in their morgues, so we want to be prepared in case we have to keep bodies for a longer period of time,” Moseley said.Anyone calling the coronavirus a hoax is a fool, and this is about to become increasingly apparent over the next 3-4 months as the path of the coronavirus continues to follow almost exactly what I publicly predicted in April. It also means that you can expect a wave of lockdowns to continue to spread across America as hospitalizations and deaths accelerate.We could have stopped this entire thing with zinc, vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine and wearing masks in public places. But instead, America has become so stupid and irrational that, instead, we are going to endure a devastating second wave of deaths and lockdowns that will probably devastate our economy and end in the total collapse of the United States of America.I have a new, nine-hour audio book coming out soon that you can download for free.

Hybrid virus developed by scientists claims to make coronavirus research “safer”,"(Natural News) Studying the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) has been difficult due to how infectious the virus is and the need to keep researchers safe. To work around this, scientists have developed a virus that acts just like the coronavirus but doesn’t cause severe disease.Currently, any laboratory research of SARS-CoV-2 – the pathogen behind COVID-19 – requires a high level of biosafety. Researchers work inside laboratories with multiple containment levels and specialized ventilation systems, all while wearing bulky full-body biohazard suits with pressurized respirators.While necessary, these safety measures limit who can research the coronavirus to those labs that can afford the necessary equipment. This slows down efforts to find medicines and cures for the virus.“Hybrid” virus created to make research saferTo allow researchers and institutions who don’t have access to the necessary biosafety equipment to contribute to the fight against the coronavirus, researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have created a new “hybrid” virus that infects cells and interacts with antibodies just like how the SARS-CoV-2 does. Unlike the latter, however, this new virus does not cause any severe illness.The researchers used another virus, called a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as a base for the new hybrid virus. VSV is a workhorse in virology labs since it’s easy to manipulate genetically while, at the same time, being fairly innocuous. The virus primarily infects animals such as horses, cattle and pigs. When it does occasionally infect people, it only causes a mild, flu-like illness that lasts from three to five days.Aside from being less deadly, one of the main differences between VSV and SARS-CoV-2 is how they infect cells. While viruses in general use proteins on their surface to attack cells, the latter uses what scientists have dubbed a “spike” protein.To create the hybrid virus then, the scientists removed VSV’s surface protein gene and replaced it with the one from SARS-CoV-2. The resulting hybrid, dubbed VSV-SARS-CoV-2, has the coronavirus’ spike protein, allowing it to target cells in the same manner, but lacks the genes needed to cause severe illness.Once they had the new virus, they tested it against antibodies from COVID-19 survivors. The test shows that the antibodies reacted to the hybrid virus in the same way that they did against the real SARS-CoV-2 virus. At the same time, antibodies that worked against the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 also worked against SARS-CoV-2. (Related: Most coronavirus patients develop “neutralizing antibodies” after recovery, but are they enough to head off another infection?)“Humans certainly develop antibodies against other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but it’s the antibodies against spike that seem to be most important for protection,” said co-senior author Dr. Sean Whelan. “So as long as a virus has the spike protein, it looks to the human immune system like SARS-CoV-2, for all intents and purposes.”New virus will supposedly accelerate the development of treatmentsAccording to the team, this new hybrid virus could help more scientists evaluate a range of preventative treatments for COVID-19 that are based on neutralizing antibodies.“One of the problems in evaluating neutralizing antibodies is that a lot of these tests require a BSL-3 facility, and most clinical labs and companies don’t have BSL-3 facilities,” explained Dr. Michael S. Diamond, co-senior author of the study.“With this surrogate virus, you can take serum, plasma or antibodies and do high-throughput analyses at BSL-2 levels, which every lab has, without a risk of getting infected. And we know that it correlates almost perfectly with the data we get from bona fide infectious SARS-CoV-2,” he added.According to Diamond, the hybrid virus could be used to test to see where or not an experimental vaccine triggers the creation of neutralizing antibodies, to measure whether a COVID-19 survivor carries enough of these antibodies to donate plasma to other COVID-19 patients or even identify if any antibodies have the potential to be developed into antiviral medicines.In addition to being useful for expanding research on SARS-CoV-2, the fact that the hybrid virus has the same spike protein as the latter and triggers the same antibodies means that it could possibly also be used as a vaccine. According to Diamond, he and his colleagues are already conducting animal studies to evaluate the possibility.Whether or not the hybrid VSV-SARS-CoV-2 virus can be effective as a vaccine is another matter altogether.Vaccines work by using a virus, or something similar to it, to trigger the immune system to the production of antibodies against it. Studies have shown, however, that antibodies the body produces to fight SARS-CoV-2 tend to fade after just a few months. This means that the immunity provided by any COVID-19 vaccine – not just that based on the hybrid virus – will likely not last for long.Learn more about the efforts to develop treatments against COVID-19 at Pandemic.news.Sources include:ScienceDaily.comFuturism.com",7/25/20 0:00,-31.92926829
"UK study shows COVID-19 antibodies fade quickly, rendering vaccines pointless","(Natural News) COVID-19 has proven time and time again that it’s unlike any other illness society has faced, and a new study shows that preventing the disease is going to be incredibly challenging, as infections do not give people long-term immunity to the disease as many had hoped.This is according to a study that was recently carried out by London’s Guy’s and St. Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust. The researchers studied the immune response in patients with the disease and found that the antibodies they developed decreased within a few weeks after the onset of symptoms. This means that people could well become reinfected after recovering from the illness.According to the study, 23 days after the symptoms first appeared in patients, 60 percent experienced a potent antibody response; 65 days later, just 16.7 percent had this response. Antibodies are the proteins your body makes to fight off an infection. If there is any silver lining here, it’s the fact that those who had a more severe infection enjoyed an antibody response that was stronger and lasted longer.The study looked at 59 patients who had tested positive for the disease, the majority of whom were men. Researchers collected sequential serum samples from the patients from one day to 94 days after their symptoms first appeared. They also looked at 31 healthcare workers who volunteered to undergo regular antibody tests.The researchers noted that the antibody response to COVID-19 that they found was similar to that seen in other types of human coronaviruses, such seasonal coronaviruses linked to the common cold and SARS. In these viruses, a person’s antibody response tends to fade for a period of time that can be as little as 12 weeks or as long as 34 months after infection.This study isn’t just bad news for those who have suffered from the disease and are hoping to avoid a repeat; it also indicates that coming up with a vaccine could be complicated, if not impossible. Even those with severe infections who enjoyed longer antibody responses still saw those effects fading within just a few months. That could mean, at the very least, that if a vaccine is developed, it will need to be administered frequently.Dr. Mala Maini, a virus expert from University College London, told CNN that the study “suggests vaccines will need to be better at inducing high levels of longer-lasting antibodies than the natural infection or that doses may need to be repeated to maintain immunity.”Other studies show similar antibody issuesThe U.K. study is just the latest evidence that getting infected with COVID-19 doesn’t mean people can let their guard down. A study from Spain found that just five percent of the population there had coronavirus antibodies despite experiencing a significant outbreak this spring. Moreover, their immunity to the disease faded after just a few weeks. This means that 95 percent of the country’s population is still susceptible to the virus.The study, which took place from April to June, encompassed more than 61,000 participants, making it the largest study of its kind to date in Europe.The study also concluded that the antibodies in Spain’s population were not sufficient to provide herd immunity, which occurs when a population is allowed a certain amount of exposure to the virus to build up immunity among the general population.Meanwhile, a study out of China that compared the antibody responses of 37 symptomatic patients with 37 asymptomatic people found that those who did not have symptoms experienced a weaker antibody response than those who did have symptoms.Many people have already expressed concerns about the potential side effects of a rushed COVID-19 vaccine, but that may be a moot point if the vaccine is incapable of providing people with immunity to the disease in the first place.Sources for this article include:TheEpochTimes.comEdition.CNN.comCNBC.com",7/19/20 0:00,-35.53441176
Another study shows how quickly COVID-19 antibodies disappear,"(Natural News) When the coronavirus crisis first began, there was a lot of hope that at least those who survive the disease will develop immunity to it and won’t have to worry about catching it again. However, it has become painfully apparent that it doesn’t work that way at all. In fact, a trio of studies that have been released recently illustrate just how fleeting the immunity offered by coronavirus antibodies truly is.The newest study comes out of London, where COVID-19 patients’ immune responses were analyzed. The researchers discovered that the levels of antibodies that could kill the virus dropped quickly after peaking a few weeks after the patients first exhibited symptoms. At the peak of their battle against the disease, 60 percent of the patients had a “potent” antibody response; two months later, however, only 16.7 percent of them had such a response.For some patients, the antibody response against the virus went on to become undetectable. The study’s lead author, Katie Doores, said that although people are producing reasonable antibody responses to the virus, that response is fading quickly.Meanwhile, a large study carried out in Spain showed that antibodies disappear just weeks after people test positive for the disease, deflating hopes for the possibility of attaining herd immunity. Herd immunity occurs when enough of the population becomes immune to a certain disease, either by already getting sick or through vaccines, to make it unlikely to spread throughout the community. The study, which was published in the journal Lancet, found that 14 percent of those who tested positive for antibodies did not have any antibodies just weeks later.The study involved more than 60,000 participants, who answered questionnaires about symptoms and were given antibody and blood tests.The report stated: “At present, herd immunity is difficult to achieve without accepting the collateral damage of many deaths in the susceptible population and overburdening of health systems.”A different study, this one from China, found that antibodies faded quickly in people with COVID-19 symptoms and asymptomatic patients alike. The scientists found that more than 90 percent of people in both groups experienced deep declines in their antibody levels two to three months after the onset of their infection. Among the asymptomatic group, 40 percent tested negative for antibodies just eight weeks after being released from isolation.Vaccines aren’t the answerOf course, it goes without saying that if antibodies do disappear this quickly, any vaccine that is developed would have to be administered repeatedly throughout the year if people wanted to gain any amount of protection whatsoever. Most people don’t want to get even one vaccine, much less various shots throughout the year.Making matters even more complicated is the fact that even if a coronavirus patient does develop antibodies, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they will have any immunity at all. Writing for CNN, Dr. William Haseltine said: “Only 15 percent of those who test positive for antibodies make the neutralizing antibodies necessary to develop immunity.”Unfortunately, it looks like COVID-19 is much like many other types of coronavirus. The antibodies for other common coronaviruses generally disappear completely within somewhere between four months and a year, which is why people can catch the same one every year.Vaccines may not offer much protection from the disease after all, and their long-term effects will be largely untested as they are rushed to the market. These studies underscore the importance of preventing the disease naturally. Wear a mask when you’ll be around others, and don’t forget that washing your hands frequently remains essential. One of the best lines of defense is keeping your immune system up. Eat a healthy and well-balanced diet, and make sure you get plenty of Vitamin C, zinc, and Vitamin D from the sun.Sources for this article include:EndoftheAmericanDream.comMiamiHerald.comEndoftheAmericanDream.comCBSNews.com",7/17/20 0:00,-41.94705882
Doubts raised on effectiveness of coronavirus antibody testing in the UK,"(Natural News) Rapid antibody tests have been hailed as an effective way to check for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection for anyone who needs immediate results. Experts in the U.K., however, have warned that antibody tests are not reliable enough while questioning the use of wide-scale testing to influence public behavior.According to a review of studies conducted by Cochrane, a U.K.-based network that assesses health research to help direct policy, roughly one in 10 antibody tests will miss cases of COVID-19. This could lead to people making harmful decisions delaying treatment or even traveling.“There is no decision [patients] should be making based on the results of a test,” stated the review’s lead author Jon Deeks, a professor of biostatistics at Birmingham University in England. “We have to ask: Is this doing more harm than good?”Review of studies raises doubts on antibody tests’ accuracyCochrane’s review took a look at 54 studies, the majority of which took place in China. In addition, it also looked at over 11,000 patient records and focused on 25 commercially available tests. Antibody test kits from Roche and Abbott Laboratories – those acquired by the British government – were not included in the review.In reviewing the studies, the researchers outlined several concerns about their quality. This included the small size of some of the studies, as well as the inclusion of multiple samples from the same patients.“Methodological limitations raise questions about how trustworthy these figures are,” said Deeks.In one of the studies reviewed – a British one at that – the biomarker manufacturers did not approve the identification of the tests that had been evaluated. According to Deeks, this raised “moral issues.”The review did find that that the tests, which rely on either a finger prick or blood being drawn from a vein, were much better at detecting the coronavirus in people at least two weeks after the onset of symptoms.Tests conducted up to seven days after symptoms manifested picked up only 30 percent of coronavirus cases, the study found. From eight to 14 days after the onset, the tests found 70 percent; 15 to 35 days afterward, the tests detected more than 90 percent.“The clearest result we have is that: Timing is critical,” said Deeks.The researchers, however, said that they have no data on how well the tests work more than five weeks after symptoms manifest. In addition, they also state that the test’s accuracy may be much lower outside a healthcare setting – most of the studies evaluated the accuracy in hospitalized patients. As such, it is unclear whether they can detect antibody levels associated with milder and asymptomatic cases.Based on their findings, the researchers said that the U.K. government’s antibody program should only be carried out for population-wide research purposes as scientists can adjust for accuracy limitations when looking at large datasets. The antibody tests should not, however, be used to inform individual decision-making.Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University, who was not involved in the review, said that the review’s findings “make it very clear that most, if not all, commercially available tests are not sufficiently accurate to warrant their use outside of the healthcare setting.”Immunity passports in doubtThe Cochrane review deals a serious blow to efforts to create “immunity passports” based on antibody testing, allowing people to go about their lives without fear of catching the COVID-19. (Related: The Bill Gates global nightmare is coming true with COVI-PASS Immunity Passports.)Back in March, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed that the tests would be a “total game-changer” and that they would be “as simple as a pregnancy test” – neither of which has been the case.While the test kits used by the British government – supplied by Roche and Abbott Laboratories – were not part of the review, issues have been raised about them as well.In May, Deeks called into question the effectivity of these test kits. He pointed out how, in a review of Roche’s own evidence, their test kit failed to pick up 15 known coronavirus antibody-positive samples out of 93. The Abbott test, on the other hand, was more sensitive, picking up 90 out of 96 positive samples.Despite all the concerns raised, however, U.K. officials remain adamant about antibody testing, with the Department of Health and Social Care stating that “antibody testing will improve our understanding of how coronavirus is spreading across the country, which will be vital for future decisions about controlling the virus.”Keep up with the latest at Pandemic.news.Sources include:FT.comDailyMail.com",7/15/20 0:00,-28.88431818
The coronavirus may actually be a vascular – and not a respiratory – disease,"(Natural News) The symptoms of COVID-19 may very well be eldritch horrors. In most cases, it can appear as cough, fever, chills and headache. But in severe cases, it can cause acute kidney failure and multiple organ damage – strange symptoms for what’s known as mainly a respiratory infection.How COVID-19 causes the latter, in particular, was the focus of a recent paper by a team from University Hospital Zurich. In their report, senior author Frank Ruschitzka examined COVID-19 patients who exhibited severe symptoms. After the first body was autopsied, it showed tiny clots and dead cells within the capillaries of the lungs, as well as distended blood vessels in every organ in the body – a sign of severe inflammation.This also showed why patients with severe COVID-19 are more likely to have strokes, blood clots and even heart attacks: The virus had targeted their blood vessels.“[COVID-19] is a vascular problem,” added Ruschitzka, who published his team’s findings in the Lancet. “The lung is the main battlefield, but it’s a disease of the blood vessels.”A blood vessel disease?Months into the pandemic and with over 8 million cases and counting, medical experts are now looking into the possibility that COVID-19 is a vascular disease.According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, patients who died from COVID-19 had nine times as many clots in their lungs as those who died of the H1N1 flu. Other studies have similar results, from inflammatory symptoms in children to strokes in adults with no history of the condition.A study from Belgium looked at the findings of this study, as well as the Zurich study, and found that damage in the endothelial cells that line blood vessels in the lungs can predict if a COVID-19 patient will slip into the fatal “second phase” of the disease. In the report, senior author Peter Carmeliet explained that an infection can cause blood vessels to leak and clot in some patients. This, in turn, triggers inflammation in the body, as well as gives rise to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) – the complication responsible for most COVID-19 deaths.“It’s a vicious cycle,” explained Nilam Mangalmurti, a lung expert at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, who wasn’t involved in the new study.Blood vessels link chronic disease and COVID-19The Belgian study, published in Nature Reviews Immunology, can shine a light on why COVID-19 is life-threatening for people with chronic illnesses like diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease, as the cells lining their blood vessels are already compromised.Endothelial cells do more than line blood vessels and tissues. They also control the flow of substances and fluid into and out of a tissue, regulate blood pressure, prevent inflammation and inhibit clots. When these are injured, the cells signal immune cells and clotting factors to help repair the site of injury, as well as warn other cells of potential invaders.Based on autopsy reports detailed in the Zurich study, researchers of the Belgian study believe that SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen behind COVID-19, can cause this response to go out of control. (Related: Coronavirus hijacks immune cells to create cytokine storms, says new study.)Aside from exploring the possibility of COVID-19 being a vascular disease, researchers are also looking into the idea of using existing anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting treatments for the disease. In the U.S. and Europe, clinical trials that use drugs are already in progress. In China, the government has taken a more natural route, promoting the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine in treating COVID-19.Pandemic.news has more on the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus.Sources include:ScienceMag.orgCoronavirus.JHU.eduNEJM.orgNews.CGTN.com",6/28/20 0:00,-32.79277778
Scientists warn: Antibodies your body makes to fight the coronavirus don’t last long,"(Natural News) Antibodies that can supposedly grant immunity from COVID-19 have been the linchpin of many strategies to fight the ongoing pandemic. A new study, however, looks to put a damper on those plans.Published on the journal Nature Medicine, this new study suggests that antibodies that the immune system produces against the coronavirus may last only two to three months.Antibodies don’t last that longAntibodies that can fight other coronaviruses, such as those that cause SARS and MERS, are thought to last for about a year. Based on this, scientists were hoping that antibodies against the Wuhan coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) would last at least as long.Chinese researchers looked at 37 asymptomatic people and compared them to an equal number of people who had symptoms from the Wanzhou District in central China.Several studies have shown that people who are most visibly ill with COVID-19 develop antibodies against the disease. This new study, however, is the first to look at the immune response of asymptomatic people.The researchers found that the asymptomatic people did produce antibodies; however, their immune response was weaker than in those who developed symptoms.More importantly, the antibody levels fell to undetectable levels in 40 percent of asymptomatic people, compared to just 13 percent of those who had symptoms.Other experts question the studyWhile the study shows that antibody levels dropped quickly, especially in asymptomatic people, several experts cautioned that this doesn’t necessarily mean that people can get infected a second time.These experts pointed out that the researchers did not into account the protection offered by immune cells that may fight the coronavirus on their own or produce new antibodies when they detect the virus.Studies have already shown that the coronavirus triggers a cellular immune response, that is both robust and protective.“Most people are generally not aware of T cell immunity, and so much of the conversation has focused on antibody levels,” said Columbia University virologist Angela Rasmussen.Aside from virus-killing T cells, infected people also make so-called memory B cells, which can rapidly ramp up antibody production should they detect the coronavirus again.Current immunity strategies may need rethinkingThe results of the study cast doubt on the proposal for “immunity passports” that many experts, including those in the World Health Organization (WHO), have proposed.With “immunity passports,” people who have been confirmed to have immunity against the coronavirus, either through antibody testing or because they’ve recovered from the disease, will be allowed to return to normal life.The idea is that this would allow businesses to return to normal and economies to recover without having to risk a second wave of the disease — everyone who’s up and about should theoretically already be immune.Another idea that the study shoots down is that of “herd immunity.” This concept relies on having a large enough portion of the general populace be immune to SARS-CoV-2, that it’s unable to spread to those who don’t have immunity.Based on the study, however, these ideas won’t work since it implies that people don’t retain their immunity for very long.Other studies do show that the immune systems of people who’ve recovered may be able to fight off the virus through other means; however, it would be reckless to just rely on these, especially as scientists still have much to learn about the disease.Perhaps, a more responsible approach to the ongoing pandemic would be to focus on protecting people from catching the disease in the first place, providing people with protective equipment while testing and isolating those who’ve already caught it.Sources include:Futurism.comNYTimes.comScienceDirect.comWHO.int",6/21/20 0:00,-50.95142857
"People with mild symptoms can develop immunity against coronavirus, says research","(Natural News) French researchers have found that even mild cases of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) can produce antibodies in almost all patients. In addition, they reveal that the patient’s defenses against the virus increase as he starts recovery.The report, which is posted on the medRxiv server, adds evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 could acquire some degree of immunity. But it’s still unclear how long recovered patients carry immunity or to what degree.The issue of whether a person develops immunity against the coronavirus is something that continues to baffle scientists and policymakers alike. Currently, even scientists are divided on the idea that people with COVID-19 develop an immunity to it, and many public health policies are hinged on people developing immunity from the disease, or herd immunity.Based on initial reports, patients who have mild COVID-19 symptoms either lack or have a limited presence of antibodies.Most patients with mild symptoms develop antibodiesIn the current study, researchers from the Pasteur Institute in Paris took samples from over 160 health workers from the CHU de Strasbourg Hospital in France. The health workers all tested positive for COVID-19 after a “super-spreader” event – a five-day prayer and fasting gathering at an evangelical church in eastern France. While the health workers who participated in the study had the coronavirus, they weren’t ill enough to be admitted to hospital.The team noted that most COVID-19 studies on immunity looked at patients who were hospitalized following severe illness and then recovered. Their study, in contrast, focused on mild cases, which make up for around 80 percent of all infections.The researchers used two assay tests to determine if the participants had developed antibodies – a commercially available test kit, and a test designed by the team to identify if antibodies were produced and if they have the ability to neutralize the virus. From the results of the second test, 99.4 percent of the participants produced antibodies – only one participant, a 58-year-old man, had no antibodies detected.The team also noted that a person’s antibody response grew stronger as he recovered. The antibodies were also effective in fighting off the virus. (Related: Coronavirus hijacks immune cells to create cytokine storms, says new study.)“The [neutralizing] activity is present much later than the appearance of antibodies and this is encouraging,” senior author Olivier Schwartz told Le Monde newspaper. He also added that his team is looking forward to studying the participants further to see how long the antibodies stay in their system.The researchers also noted that the ability of antibodies to neutralize the virus becomes stronger over time. In particular, the neutralization activity of the antibodies was at 97 percent four weeks after the onset of symptoms. This could mean that most individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms develop antibodies within a month after exhibiting symptoms.“Although not yet demonstrated, several lines of evidence suggest that the presence of [neutralizing] antibodies may be associated with protective immunity for Sars-CoV-2 infection,” the researchers concluded in their report. They added that patients who recovered from SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, had antibodies that persisted for at least two years after the infection.Meanwhile, a separate study from the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported a case of a monoclonal antibody from a recovering COVID-19 patient. In the report, which was published in Nature, the team noted that the antibody exhibited a strong ability to kill the virus when it was used in treatment, as well as prevent the increase in viral load during preventive treatment.Pandemic.news has more on the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.Sources include:TheGuardian.comMedRxiv.com",6/15/20 0:00,-18.76875
"Pro-life group warns about COVID vaccines made from aborted babies, vaccine mandates","(Natural News) A pro-life group has called attention to some of the ethical issues surrounding vaccines and the coronavirus vaccine in particular, especially when it comes to the vaccines being made using the cells of aborted babies and the possibility of mandatory vaccination.The Personhood Alliance issued 10 key points outlining the group’s official position on the ethics of vaccines. They are based on the principle of “the rights of born persons not to be forced to violate their own bodily integrity and/or moral conscience and the rights of pre-born persons not to be trafficked, commodified, and/or experimented upon without their consent.”Many of the Big Pharma companies that make vaccines use cells from aborted babies to produce them. This is considered unethical by the alliance, who called on vaccine makers to do more to produce more ethical varieties, particularly in cases where taxpayer funding is being used.They added that Christians should be demanding that pharmaceutical companies put a stop to the commodification and trafficking of humans at all stages of life and avoid practices that “perpetuate and encourage the relationship between abortion, biomedical science, and human trafficking, no matter when that connection was initiated or how long a practice has been socially accepted.”Tyler, Texas Bishop Joseph Strickland has been vocal about this topic. In April, he tweeted that if the only way to get a vaccine for this virus is by using the body parts of aborted children, he will refuse it. He added: “I will not kill children to live.”Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano and a group of other Cardinals issued a public letter in May reminding Catholics that it is morally unacceptable to use a vaccine that is derived from aborted fetuses. They added that people should be given the chance to refuse these vaccines without facing any penalties. It was signed by 22 priests as well as journalists, lawyers, doctors and academics. It has already collected more than 57,000 signatures.Vaccine mandates “unethical and intrusive”Their document also addresses the topic of mandatory vaccines, calling such policies “unethical and intrusive.” They said that people’s rights to refuse medical treatment on religious, health or moral grounds should be preserved and protected by law and that this should extend to decisions about vaccination. They added that forcing vaccines on people is a “violation of their biblical personhood.”Bishop Athanasius Schneider of Astana, Kazakhstan, had harsh words for the practice, calling mandatory vaccines in an interview “the last step of Satanism.” Pope Francis, meanwhile, recently called for vaccinations to be “universal and for all.”In May, President Trump confirmed that coronavirus vaccines will not be forced on people who do not want them at the federal level, acknowledging that not everyone will be willing to subject their bodies to these shots. However, individual governments could still require mandatory COVID vaccines at the state level.Even without federal or state mandates, some employers could end up demanding that their workforce be vaccinated, even against their will. This could be much like what happens in the medical field now with doctors and nurses, who can lose their jobs for refusing to get a flu shot.It isn’t a stretch to imagine certain types of workers being pushed out of their jobs for non-compliance, especially people working in hospitality or education, for example.There are far too many ways that people could be coerced into getting the COVID shot, and the fact that many of the front-runner vaccines in development contain the cells of aborted babies adds an even more horrifying element to an already highly disturbing prospect.Sources for this article include:LifeSiteNews.comNaturalNews.com",10/19/20 0:00,-26.24888889
Johnson & Johnson’s aborted baby Covid-19 vaccine harms trial participant,"(Natural News) Things are going exceptionally poorly for Big Pharma in its quest to release “warp speed” vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19). The latest casualty is Johnson & Johnson, which halted its trial due to an “unexplained illness” in one of its participants.Similar to what happened with AztraZeneca’s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine trial, J&J observed a participant suffer from a serious adverse event, prompting the company to put an immediate stop to its Phase 3 operations.This means that all trials involving J&J’s vaccine candidate, including a large-scale one launched on Sept. 22 by Janssen with an anticipated enrollment of 60,000 volunteers at 215 research sites, are now on hold while the pharma giant investigates what happened.In cooperation with an “independent Data Safety Monitoring Board,” J&J is reportedly evaluating the participant, whose illness has not yet been publicly released. J&J’s “internal clinical and safety physicians” are also involved in the investigation.According to the company, adverse events “are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies.” As a result, there are “prespecified guidelines” for how to proceed when a “serious adverse event” occurs.More stories like this one can be found at Pandemic.news.Injecting aborted babies into your body is never a good ideaHaving received $1.5 billion from the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to produce a vaccine, J&J, along with AstraZeneca and several others that also received taxpayer funding, are rushing at “warp speed” to get a Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine to market as quickly as possible.In J&J’s case, its vaccine contains a human fetal cell line known as PER.C6 that was taken from the retinal tissue of an 18-week-old baby boy who was aborted in The Netherlands back in 1985 and turned into a fetal cell line 10 years later.AstraZeneca’s jab, which reportedly caused transverse myelitis in a participant, is similarly derived from an aborted baby cell line known as HEK 293. Like J&J, AstraZeneca halted its Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine trial when its aborted baby jab caused harm in a participant.“I isolated retina from a fetus, from a healthy fetus as far as could be seen, of 18 weeks old,” stated Dr. Alex van der Eb, who developed the PER.C6 aborted baby cell line used in J&J’s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine.“There was nothing special with a family history or the pregnancy was completely normal up to the 18 weeks, and it turned out to be a socially indicated abortus – abortus provocatus, and that was simply because the woman wanted to get rid of the fetus … what was written down was unknown father, and that was, in fact, the reason why the abortion was requested.”It is no wonder that participants are suffering serious adverse events, as foreign DNA from aborted babies is not supposed to be injected into other human beings to “cure” them from alleged viruses, which is exactly what is now happening under Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” mass vaccination program.Thanks to Trump’s large cash infusion into J&J, the company is expected to very soon deliver 100 million doses of its aborted baby vaccine, with the option already in place to deliver many more should the government request them.“The volunteers for these vaccine trials are probably the insane screeching Karens that have an aneurysm whenever they spot someone without a mask at 100 yards,” wrote one LifeSiteNews commenter about the situation.“There is a horrifying, fatal illness that attacks the brain – which only cannibals get,” noted another, the suggestion being that the aborted fetal cell component of these Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines is akin to cannibalism.“This is the same thing on a lesser scale.

"Universal vaccination passport has been in development since 2018, requires absolute compliance with endless list of vaccines","(Natural News) As the current pandemic rages on, people around the world are being ordered to do things for the “greater good.” Governments are requiring specific things from people in order to protect the “public health.”Long before the current pandemic, the European Union had been in the planning stages of developing a “common vaccination card/passport.” This universal vaccination passport is also designed for the “greater good” and will be implemented as a requirement to protect the “public health.”How might your liberty and livelihood be restricted if you do not succumb to all the vaccines required for the universal passport?Populations around the world are currently being conditioned to socially distance themselves from one another, in the expectation that everyone they meet is a biological source of contamination — innately guilty of spreading disease. Showing no authorization of immunity, every person is to be considered a filthy vector of disease and is to be avoided at all costs. The vaccination passport will be presented as the solution to quell these disease fears. By showing electronic proof of vaccination, people will be able to “return to normal” – a term used by authorities to coerce people to believe that biologics (vaccines) are the passport to prove absolute immunization. The commercialization of social distancing will continue until all citizens can prove they have received the authorized injections.The European Union has been working on global vaccine passport since 2018The planning stages began in 2018 when the European Union released a survey comparing public confidence/skepticism toward vaccines. The survey, titled “2018 State of Vaccine Confidence” was presented to the European Commission. The report immediately criticized “vaccine hesitancy” and praised “vaccine confidence,” in an attempt to build public trust in the effectiveness and safety of vaccines. The report immediately blames “vaccine delays and refusals” as the sole reason why outbreaks occur, why people are dying. One of the ways these central vaccine planners can eliminate “vaccine delays and refusals” is to blame people for diseases they don’t have. The next step is to socially isolate anyone who refuses vaccines by restricting their liberties.A “common vaccine passport” achieves these goals. This passport is blatant coercion, a violation of informed consent in medicine, an attack on personal choice, and ultimately sets the stage for segregation of healthy, unvaccinated people from society.The central vaccine planners do not care how they ultimately coerce or manipulate people into submission. Soon after this coercive report was published, the EU commissioned a technical report titled “Designing and implementing an immunization information system” which mapped a monitoring system to ensure compliance to vaccinations. The report examined the development of a “common vaccination card/ passport for all including a comprehensive electronic immunization information system that can monitor vaccine compliance. Finally, the report sought to “overcome the legal and technical barriers impeding the interoperability of national immunization information systems.”By the third quarter of 2019, the EU created the “Vaccination Roadmap” designed to combat “vaccine hesitancy.” During this time, social media platforms began to label any information about vaccine choice, natural immunity, vaccine risk, and vaccine injury as dangerous “misinformation.”Global Vaccination Summit and the “call to action” to implement the vaccine passportBy September 2019, the EU and the World Health Organization held the “Global Vaccination Summit.” There, “influential” leaders announced “10 Actions towards Vaccination for All” – a coercive plan to manipulate people into vaccine compliance. To make matters worse, just a month later, Event 201 was held. Sponsored by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Event 201 simulated a pandemic exercise focusing on a zoonotic novel coronavirus originating in bats. By November of 2019, these central vaccine planners had suggested a “call to action.”All this planning came before the current pandemic. The people who have planned for a vaccine passport are now calling for a “certificate of immunity.” Central vaccine planners like Bill Gates are now parading the media, and are putting their “call to action” into motion. People are now being told by their governments and their media that life cannot go back to normal unless there is a vaccine. The vaccine, currently being rushed into existence, will enable the coercive and forceful vaccination passport to become a reality.The planning is documented. The coercion is out in the open. Will you be a slave to this system of medical rape, as individual consent, choice, and human dignity are stripped away?Sources include:OffGuardian.orgEC.Europa.euOffGuardian.orgECDC.Europa.euCenterforHealthSecurity.org",6/3/20 0:00,-28.37348837
"Eugenicist Bill Gates co-hosted a “high-level pandemic exercise” back in October, just in time for the patented coronavirus he helped fund to be unleashed","(Natural News) Not long before Chinese coronavirus started making global headlines, The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, held a high-level pandemic exercise called “Event 201” that seems to have been a predictive blueprint for what’s now transpiring with the coronavirus outbreak.On October 18, 2019, representatives from each of the aforementioned groups descended on New York City to discuss how they would respond to “a severe pandemic” much like the one we’re now being told is spreading across China and into the West.The exercise “illustrated areas where public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences,” an official announcement from Event 201 reads.“In recent years, the world has seen a growing number of epidemic events, amounting to approximately 200 events annually,” the announcement goes on to explain. “These events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society.”According to the event’s organizers, a pandemic like the one we could be seeing form right now before our very eyes requires “cooperation” among governments, industries, and “key international institutions” – the latter presumably referring to organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Is coronavirus yet another ploy to thin the “herd” and sell more vaccines?The timing of Event 201 is nothing short of suspicious in light of the fact that coronavirus is all the media is talking about right now. It’s even eclipsing President Trump’s impeachment proceedings in the Senate, with news about entire cities in China that are home to tens of millions of people being put under mandatory quarantine.We’re also seeing headlines about coronavirus popping up in major U.S. cities like Seattle, Houston and Chicago, which is starting to generate panic here in our own country about how far this thing will go before either fizzling out – a best-case scenario – or spreading like wildfire.As Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, is now warning, the rapid adaptation or mutation of coronavirus suggests that this might be another weaponized viral strain that was intentionally unleashed for eugenics purposes.Mainstream reporting is admitting that coronavirus is constantly changing like some kind of self-replicating bioweapon, which is all too convenient considering that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Pirbright Institute owns a patent on coronavirus for vaccine creation purposes.Was this whole outbreak engineered for the purpose of scaring the general public into accepting yet another government vaccine? Is it also about depopulating the planet as part of Bill Gates’ admitted efforts to use vaccination and “health care” as a means of reducing the world’s population by 10 to 15 percent?Time will tell what becomes of this latest public health scare, but one thing is for sure: Bill Gates and his eugenicist buddies are chomping at the bit to vaccinate the entire planet against coronavirus and any other disease they can conjure up as a deadly bioweapon.At the current time, the fatality rate associated with coronavirus infection is relatively low, around two percent. But that could very quickly change as the virus mutates and adapts to new environments, creating the horrific scenario predicted by Event 201.“Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global – a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences,” the Event 201 description ominously forebodes.“A severe pandemic, which becomes ‘Event 201,’ would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions.”To keep up with the latest news about coronavirus, be sure to check out Outbreak.news.You can also learn more about how many of these contagion scares are pre-planned, engineered false flag events at FalseFlag.news.Sources for this article include:CenterForHealthSecurity.orgNaturalNews.comPatents.Justia.comNaturalNews.com",1/29/20 0:00,-19.35678571
Doctor who cured 350 coronavirus patients with 100% success rate speaks out passionately in Washington D.C.,"(Natural News) Dr. Stella Immanuel of the Rehoboth Medical Center in Houston, Texas went viral in a matter of hours after appearing live at the “White Coat Summit” in Washington, D.C. in front of the Supreme Court of the United States. Dr. Immanuel gave a hopeful, passionate speech about curing coronavirus patients with 100 percent effectiveness.The event was led by an organization called America’s Frontline Doctors, a group founded by Dr. Simone Gold, a board-certified physician and attorney. The group of medical doctors came together and presented a message of hope and addressed a “massive disinformation campaign” about the coronavirus — disinformation that is suppressing immune system modulating cures, treatment, and prevention.Courageous doctor goes public with covid-19 cureDr. Immanuel cured three hundred fifty coronavirus patients with a 100 percent success rate using a combination of hydroxychloroquine (sixty-year-old anti-viral compound with a track record of safety and effectiveness) zinc (an immune system modulating mineral) and azithromycin (broad-spectrum antibiotic).The original video has already been removed by almost every Big Tech social media platform (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), as the Big Pharma gatekeepers of information try to keep the people in the dark, controlled, afraid, and subservient to an official, helpless narrative. Access the video here at Brighteon.com.Dr. Immanuel wrote that the fear, sickness, and deaths were “senseless and unnecessary.”“Covid19 has a cure,” she spoke. “It’s time for politicians to let doctors be doctors and for doctors to stop being afraid. They can silence a few but not a multitude. Join us in the fight doctors! America needs you!”Dr. Immanuel said that any study that claims hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is not effective for treating patients with coronavirus is “fake science.” She knows this for a fact because she used the antiviral medication to help all her patients recover from coronavirus infections.In fact, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who downplayed the drug’s effectiveness, actually knew about its effectiveness for treating coronavirus for fifteen years, when the NIH published studies on chloroquine’s effectiveness for treating SARS.Dr. Anthony Fauci trying to suppress effective treatments to force experimental vaccines on peopleIn what appears to be a matter of corruption, Dr. Fauci is currently trying to convince the world population to stay confined in their homes and to comply to contact tracing, restricted gathering, and indefinite mask wearing until a DNA-altering vaccine is available for population control. Fauci’s guidance has left countless men and women to die from a respiratory infection that could be cured using a simple antiviral, immune system modulating protocol.The research that Fauci knew about while working at the NIH finds that “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” HCQ is a less toxic derivative of this chloroquine and can help deliver zinc into human cells, halting viral replication and speeding up recovery time for patients. Since the new covid-19 virus is genetically related to SARS, the NIH and Dr. Fauci should have rushed to try the drug and promote its use. Instead, Dr. Fauci began raising money for new vaccines and suppressed the effectiveness of this cheap antiviral molecule.Instead of reigning from a fearful pulpit and doing photo-ops, Dr. Fauci should be meeting with front line doctors and nurses who care for coronavirus patients first hand. HCQ is an effective prophylactic and therapeutic, stopping the replication of viruses in human cells before and after infection with a live virus.Dr. Immanuel is a light in a dark world and a true leader in medicine at a time when people are being conditioned to fear their own hands and breath while submitting to arbitrary controls.Sources include:Breitbart.comBrighteon.comNaturalNews.comNaturalNews.comNaturalNews.comNaturalNews.com",7/28/20 0:00,-5.845652174
"Trump pushes for an accelerated, risky vaccine “by the end of the year,” then says coronavirus will “go away without a vaccine”","(Natural News) A few days ago, President Trump publicly announced that a new vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) would probably be ready “by the end of the year” as part of “Operation Warp Speed.” But the president has since changed his tune and is now saying that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will “go away without vaccine.”Even though it typically takes anywhere from three to five years to develop a new vaccine, the Trump administration had appeared fully supportive of developing one in a fraction of that amount of time to address the current global pandemic. Trump himself even indicated that he is “pushing very hard” to make a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine come to fruition as quickly as possible, even though this accelerated timeline puts many people’s lives at risk.“We are pushing supply lines,” Trump is quoted as saying to the media. “We don’t even have the final vaccine,” he further stated, adding that he believes “many companies are, I think, close,” citing pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson by name.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has largely agreed with Trump’s statements, indicating that it is possible “to shave a couple of months off that,” referring to a proposed 18-month accelerated timeline for the release of a new vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).“But, you know, you don’t want to over-promise,” Fauci added during an interview with CBS News. “We’ll just have to see how it goes.”Not long after this all occurred, however, President Trump switched gears and began to tell the media the exact opposite of what he had stated prior. Without going into specifics, Trump pointed to other viruses and flus that have “disappeared” before vaccines were ever developed for them, and suggested that the same will happen with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).“It’s going to go away,” Trump stated emphatically. “And we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time … They’ve never shown up again,” he added, referring to other viruses and flus in the past. “They die, too. Like everything else, they die.”What is Trump’s real position on vaccines and coronavirus?Doublespeak on the part of Trump is nothing new, and he has received plenty of criticism over the years for his duplicitous statements, sometimes made just hours apart from one another. On the other hand, some believe that Trump is playing some kind of long game where he intentionally says contradictory things to weed out who’s who in his administration.Long before he was president, Trump publicly stated that he “strongly” believes vaccines to be linked to autism, which suggests that he does not support the government’s vaccine agenda. With that said, Trump’s now-stated plan for an accelerated Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine by year’s end could simply be a decoy to bait his enemies into exposing their true intentions.On the other hand, it could be that Trump simply does not know how to tell the truth and is in a constant state of flux when it comes to his position on any given matter. Is Trump really against vaccines, or was he rallying public support for himself among vaccine skeptics years before he decided to run for president?As of this writing, Trump’s most recent stated position is that a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will not be needed because the virus is going to disappear for good some other way. And this is the position we hope he sticks with moving forward.To keep up with the latest news about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), be sure to check out Pandemic.news.Sources for this article include:CNBC.comTheGuardian.comNaturalNews.com",5/12/20 0:00,-37.92482759
"Medical trials for COVID-19 vaccine candidates may be unable to stop people from falling ill and dying, scientist warns","(Natural News) A scientist has warned that phase three trials currently underway for COVID-19 vaccine candidates may ultimately be unable to stop the coronavirus. University of Maryland professor Peter Doshi wrote in an Oct. 21 piece in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) that coronavirus vaccines currently being developed may not be able to protect people from serious illness or death once they contract the pathogen.His statements followed trials conducted by seven pharmaceutical companies – Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm and Sinovac – for their respective coronavirus vaccine candidates. Doshi, who is also the BMJ’s associate editor, pointed out two issues in the ongoing vaccine trials.First, scientists did not anticipate whether volunteers would be shielded from severe disease or death if they contract the pathogen before the vaccine is rolled out – which would only be the case if the vaccine did not work very well. This is a particular concern for senior citizens, who are the most at risk from the effects of a severe COVID-19 infection, as the vaccine may not be as effective at protecting them from the coronavirus in the first place.Vaccines typically do not work as well for people aged 60 and up because of their aged immune system. Pregnant women, children, and immunocompromised people have also been excluded from vaccine trials, so there is little data on the vaccine’s effects on these populations.Second, the studies will not prove person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 can be halted – as scientists themselves are not measuring if volunteers who contract the coronavirus pass it to their friends and family whether or not they themselves get sick.“The current phase three trials are not actually set up to prove either,” Doshi commented.Pharmaceutical companies have defended the value of these vaccine trialsMany countries in the world are hoping to discover a vaccine that works to put an end to the current coronavirus pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 1 million worldwide. Thus, a number of scientists have responded to Doshi’s take on vaccine trials.Moderna Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tal Zaks told BMJ that if its vaccine is proven to protect against mild COVID-19, the company is confident that the vaccine will be of the same effect with more severe infections. The vaccine will have to be ineffective in the first place if a person develops the disease. Zaks added that “too many people would die” if studies looked at the ability of Moderna’s vaccine to prevent coronavirus deaths. (Related: Fascism on display: The NIH owns HALF of Moderna’s new coronavirus vaccine.)Dr. Andrew Preston of the University of Bath agreed with Zaks, telling the Daily Mail that “covering every manifestation of COVID-19 would require trials so large … that they are very likely to be impossible to run and fund. Preston added that vaccine trials encompassing all COVID-19 symptoms “would delay the data so long that we’d be living without any vaccine … for years to come.”Preston remarked that testing vaccines on vulnerable populations such as the elderly would have “highly questionable ethics,” so it made more sense to test whether the vaccine worked in people who would experience less severe complications. However, he agreed that vaccine trials should be clear regarding what they will and will not report.“I suspect many … [want] to ‘return life to normal’ and so there needs to be careful consideration of what the various effects of the vaccines might be. So it’s important that as we head towards the point when mass vaccination will begin, everyone is clear about what this will change in terms of restrictions, public health and disease,” he said.Coronavirus vaccine trials barely tackle the issue of safetyPhase three trials for coronavirus vaccine candidates look at the efficacy of the jabs, but not their safety. Two pharmaceutical firms already reported volunteers experiencing adverse reactions after being administered with coronavirus vaccines.Johnson & Johnson suspended U.S. trials for its one-shot coronavirus jab after a volunteer experienced an “unexplained illness.” It identified “no clear cause” for the illness and attributed the volunteer’s adverse reaction to “many possible factors.” The drug maker’s suspension of its vaccine trials was “in compliance with regulatory standards,” it stated.AstraZeneca already reported three instances of adverse reactions in coronavirus vaccine trial participants. Two volunteers reported spinal inflammation after receiving the jab in September, while a third participant died in October. However, the British pharmaceutical company will not put vaccine trials on hold.Doshi pointed out two issues in the vaccine trials, but the real question should be: Are these new COVID-19 vaccines even safe?Sources include:DailyMail.co.ukJnJ.comTheEpochTimes.com",10/28/20 0:00,-57.8425
Who needs SCIENCE? China justifies widespread COVID-19 immunizations without bothering with clinical trials,"(Natural News) The Chinese government defended widespread immunizations against COVID-19 outside of clinical trials in the country. The vaccinations were warranted, as there were no documented side effects from the experimental vaccines, and imported COVID-19 cases proved to be a serious risk to the country. Chinese National Health Commission director for coronavirus vaccine development Zheng Zhongwei said Oct. 20 that China still sees “enormous pressure” from imported cases despite efforts to address outbreaks domestically.Chinese health authorities authorized in July the emergency use of three potential vaccine candidates made by domestic pharmaceutical companies China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), under its subsidiary China National Biotech Group, and Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Frontline workers such as medical staff treating coronavirus patients and border officials received the experimental jab, but the order has since been expanded to include those working in state-owned companies. The government is also considering a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for exchange students going overseas to study.Meanwhile, Sinovac has permitted members of the public in at least two Chinese cities to register and receive its its CoronaVac experimental shot. Zheng said that people who join Sinovac’s emergency-use program will be tracked for any adverse reactions. He added that immunized individuals reported no serious reactions beyond low-grade fevers and rashes.However, experts have criticized the large-scale vaccinations with the experimental jabs – with some calling it “dangerous” and “a misuse of the program.”New coronavirus infections in China have lingered to below 100 a day since mid-August, but the virus still resurges in small areas – with the most recent one in the eastern city of Qingdao. Chinese health officials have managed to suppress these outbreaks – including one in Beijing – through mass testing and implementation of public health protocols. Mask-wearing rules and temperature checks are still in place, and travelers from other countries need to isolate themselves for 14 days.Based on data collated by Johns Hopkins University, China has a COVID-19 caseload of 91,044, with 4,729 fatalities and 85,899 recoveries.Just like the U.S., China fast-tracked the development of its coronavirus vaccineCountries looking to move beyond the pandemic and open their economies definitely need a vaccine against the coronavirus – and fast.The vaccine development process, which usually takes years, has been compressed into months thanks to politicians looking for a cure to the pandemic that has made 40 million people worldwide sick. Under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Operation Warp Speed is one such program to fast-track the development of a COVID-19 vaccine – albeit only limited to Americans. (Related: Trump administration demanding nationwide rollout of COVID-19 vaccines by Nov. 1.)In a similar vein, Chinese drugmakers are leading the race to create an effective shot against the coronavirus. China’s emergency-use authorization parameters were approved following rigorous deliberation among vaccine and ethics experts. The World Health Organization backed these same parameters, which served as the basis for giving Sinovac and Sinopharm’s vaccine candidates the emergency green light.However, safety concerns have emerged alongside the rush to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine. Western pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca have temporarily halted their vaccine trials after volunteers experienced adverse side effects. To make matters worse, The Epoch Times reported on Oct. 15, the death of a Brazilian participant in AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine trials.Sinopharm and Sinovac representatives nevertheless assured there had been no reports of adverse reactions in phase three trial participants. Both companies have enrolled more than 50,000 people worldwide in their vaccine trials. With this outlook, Sinopharm Chairman Liu Jingzhen said his company would produce 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses next year.The two companies will have to increase their production capacity to churn out more of their vaccine doses, as some countries had already placed orders. In late September, Sinovac inked a deal with the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo for 60 million coronavirus vaccine doses costing US$90 million. Reuters reported Oct. 3 that Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria asked Brazilian health regulator Anvisa to vaccinate the state’s population with CoronaVac.The world must be aware of potential safety concerns alongside China’s efforts to fast-track a vaccine against the coronavirus.Sources include:Bloomberg.comTheEpochTimes.comReuters.com",10/28/20 0:00,-13.99651163
"Same doctors pushing masks, lockdowns to “save lives” ignore forced organ harvesting in communist China","(Natural News) There is a pandemic of illicit organ harvesting taking place on a global scale, and the medical profession, too preoccupied with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) plandemic, is either turning a blind eye to it or complicit.Those in need of vital organs who are unable to procure them through legal means are increasingly traveling to communist China, where prisoners of conscience such as members of Falun Gong are being systematically murdered by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) so their organs can be harvested and sold on the black market.This is precisely what a woman who was in need of a liver took advantage of after Dr. Alexander Toledo diagnosed her with cancer. Failing to meet transplant criteria and unwilling to accept a non-curative treatment that at best would add nine months to her life, the woman traveled to China before returning to the United States with a fresh liver.“She had received a liver transplant essentially on demand, which, of course … raised questions as to the source of the organs,” Toledo recalled about the 2008 case during an Oct. 26 online panel hosted by the University of North Carolina.While under normal circumstances a transplant patient would receive a vital organ from a deceased donor, or perhaps a living donor with an extra to spare, transplant “tourism” is changing the way that people in need of surgery are living their best lives now.In the case of the woman seen by Toledo, she returned to America with a new liver and “no meaningful donor information … beyond that the donor was young and healthy.” After doing a little digging, Toledo found out that the liver had been harvested from a prison of conscience in communist China and sold on the illicit transplant market.China’s organ harvesting trader has been verified “beyond any reasonable doubt”Since China did not have an official organ donation program at the time, it became clear very quickly that the transplant had come from an executed prisoner. Further investigation pinpointed the victim as a likely adherent to the spiritual practice of Falun Gong, which is prohibited in China.Back in 1999, the CCP launched a massive persecution campaign against Falun Gong, for which there were about 100 million adherents during the 1990s. In the decades since, China has imprisoned and executed millions of them, as well as harvested their organs.Despite a complete media blackout here in the states – this is due to nearly every major media corporation being in bed with the CCP – independent investigations have determined that the CCP is, in fact, harvesting the organs of primarily Falun Gong practitioners and selling them on the black market.And this is happening “on a significant scale,” an independent tribunal discovered back in 2019. For at least the past decade, China’s illicit organ harvesting market has been going strong with little resistance, and almost nobody in the medical profession seems to care.According to David Matas, a Canadian international human rights lawyer who has been studying the issue for at least the past 10 years, most in the medical community are turning a blind eye to China’s horrific human rights abuses, even as they continue to lecture us all about how we need to sacrifice our freedoms and liberties in order to “save lives” from being overtaken by COVID-19.Only “a tiny minority of the transplantation professionals globally are willing to do anything about transplant abuse in China,” he warns. And many of them, he adds, are buying into the “Chinese propaganda hook, line, and sinker.”“They echoed the Party line that the research is unverifiable, though it is both verifiable and verified beyond any reasonable doubt,” he contends.More related news about communist China is available at Evil.news.Sources for this article include:TheEpochTimes.comNaturalNews.comNaturalNews.com",10/29/20 0:00,-53.16407407
Remdesivir study accidentally proves hydroxychloroquine effective against coronavirus,"(Natural News) To date, there has only been one study conducted on remdesivir, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) drug that Anthony Fauci wants you to take instead of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). And it just so happens that this one-and-only study does not actually prove the effectiveness of remdesivir.As it turns out, the study proves quite the opposite: that remdesivir is essentially useless, and HCQ is a winner, when it comes to remediating the symptoms associated with a severe COVID-19 infection.Despite the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) having granted emergency approval for remdesivir as an exclusive drug treatment for COVID-19 five months ago, the latest science does not support its use as an effective therapeutic.The aforementioned single paper on remdesivir that the FDA used as “proof” of the drug’s safety and effectiveness actually found that HCQ, presumably in conjunction with the antibiotic drug azithromycin, provided the only tangible benefits observed throughout the research.This final paper, which was published just a few weeks ago on Oct. 8, determined that at least 35 percent of study participants had received HCQ. And nearly all of the patients who benefitted were those who took HCQ, as opposed to remdesivir.“Nothing in the study supports the hypothesis that [r]emdesivir is an effective antiviral for SARS-CoV-2,” notes Leo Goldstein. “The data in the final report suggests that [h]ydroxychloroquine, not [r]emdesivir, was the main factor benefitting the patients in this study.”Remdesivir harms and kills coronavirus patients; it does not healWhat is worse, the study further found that the patients who received remdesivir as opposed to HCQ actually suffered worse outcomes. You read that correctly: the drug claimed by Fauci to be a “cure” for COVID-19 is actually killing COVID-19 patients.“The study’s own numbers show an association between RDV (remdesivir) and increased mortality in the most severe patients,” Goldstein further explains. “It is also possible to conclude that RDV is net harmful for most hospitalized patients.”Another thing to note about this study is that it in no way meets any of the FDA’s usual “gold standards” for reliable research. For one, it was not double-blinded, though it was falsely reported as such.The pre-registered protocol was also changed multiple times over the course of the trial, as was the primary outcome of the research. The outcome, it turns out, was altered after it was determined that remdesivir was not providing the types of results that researchers had hoped to procure.“The outcome measures were subjective and not reliable,” Goldstein further reveals, adding that the study “was marred with conflicts of interest, aggravated by the design giving NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) and Gilead (remdesivir’s manufacturer) leverage over the hospitals and physicians treating patients.”None of this is all that surprising when considering the dark history of Gilead, which by all appearances is a terrorist organization that conspires with the deep state to commit heinous crimes against humanity.This would explain why at least three of the study’s researchers received grants and/or personal fees directly from Gilead, and conveniently failed to report these as potential conflicts of interest.Chances are that none of this will ever hit mainstream media headlines, which means readers like yourself will have to share it with your friends and family directly. We must spread the truth far and wide because the sooner we do, the sooner this whole plandemic house of cards comes crashing down where it belongs.By the way, if you are interested in taking a closer look at the study and Goldstein’s analysis of it, you can do so at this link.You can also keep up with the latest COVID-19 news by checking out Pandemic.news.Sources for this article include:WattsUpWithThat.comNaturalNews.com",10/30/20 0:00,-53.01451613
Gates vaccine spreads polio across Africa,"(Natural News) Microsoft founder Bill Gates has made himself the global vaccine czar as his foundation spends billions on spreading new vaccines globally. While much attention has been given to the role of Gates behind the corrupt WHO in promoting radical untested coronavirus vaccines, the record of the Gates Foundation pushing an oral polio vaccine across Africa gives more sobering evidence that all Gates says and does is not genuine human charity. The UN has just recently admitted that new cases of infantile paralysis or polio have resulted in Africa from an oral polio vaccine developed with strong support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It mirrors what happened in the USA in the 1950s. This is worth a closer look.(Article by F. William Engdahl republished from Journal-Neo.org)Vaccines that cause polioThe vaccine industry loves to cite development of vaccines in the 1950s as solely responsible for eradicating what was a severe paralytic illness that reached a peak in the USA after World War II and as well, in England, Germany and other European countries. Now, despite the fact that no new cases of “wild polio” virus have been detected in all Africa since 2016, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and their allies in the WHO proclaimed that Gates’ $4 billion ten-year African vaccination campaign using an oral polio vaccine had finally eliminated the dreaded polio. That was at the end of August.One week later on September 2, WHO was forced to backtrack and admit that new polio outbreaks in Sudan were linked to an ongoing series of new polio cases in Chad and Cameroon. According to the WHO, further polio cases have been registered in more than a dozen African countries including Angola, Congo, Nigeria and Zambia. But the shocking thing is that the outbreaks are all reportedly caused by the Gates-backed oral polio vaccine.In a revealing comment, a CDC virologist involved with WHO and Gates Foundation in the Africa mass polio vaccination campaign, part of something called the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, admits the vaccine is creating significantly more cases of polio paralysis than the deceptively named “wild polio” disease. “We have now created more new emergences of the virus than we have stopped,” virologist Mark Pallansch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention admitted. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is a combined effort of the WHO, UNICEF, the U.S. CDC, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Rotary International.Bill Gates was reportedly responsible for driving the campaign to develop the liquid oral polio vaccine and massively administer it to the populations of Africa and Asia despite the near absence of any cases of “wild polio.” According to one of the partners in the Gates polio initiative, from Rotary International, “Gates personally drove the development of a new polio vaccine that is now in the final stages of testing. When the idea was put forward, about the time of the last case of polio to happen in India, many were thinking the vaccine would play no important role in eradication, but Gates insisted.” When someone asked him, why polio, which had all but vanished worldwide, Gates replied, “Polio is a terrible disease.”That reply seems curious, as there are far more pervasive deadly diseases out there including malaria or chronic diarrhoea due to unsafe water, and poor sanitation across Africa that causes death by dehydration, poor absorption of nutrients or infectious complications. I would argue that both those are also “terrible.” In 2016 chronic diarrhoea was listed by the WHO as the second leading cause of death in children below five worldwide. In Africa it was cause of almost 653,000 deaths, yet Mr. Gates and friends seem to be interested in other things.The insistence of Gates on pushing massive vaccination of a new oral polio vaccine his foundation backed at a time polio even in poor countries of Asia and Africa is virtually non-existent, should ring alarm bells loudly. If his goal is to help more African children lead healthy lives, simple water treatment projects would save far more lives. Or is there something in the polio vaccine we are not being told of? Is there aluminum as adjuvant that is documented to be a central nervous system paralytic? Or other toxins?The Gates Foundation spent almost $ 4 billion to develop and administer the oral polio vaccine throughout the poorest countries in the world as of 2018. This despite that WHO stated that the cases of polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan went from about 350,000 per year to 33 in 2018. There hasn’t been a case in the Americas or Western Europe since before the Gates polio project was launched years ago.Define it away?Here it gets into some very suspicious linguistic games on the part of WHO, Gates and company. They are trying to cover their deeds by claiming that most of the polio cases are actually something they decided to call acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). That is a debilitating condition with a clinical picture virtually identical to polio. But it keeps the “polio” numbers down. According to the US CDC, there were over 31,500 documented cases of acute flaccid paralysis from just 18 countries in 2017. This is in addition to what they call vaccine-associated polio paralysis (VAPP). Yet from the point of clinical symptoms, vaccine-derived polio, wild polio and acute flaccid paralysis are identical, as is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a subtype of AFP. With this proliferation of serious medical-sounding names to describe what produces the same medical symptoms, we have huge ground for manipulation.A paper written by Neetu Vashishi and Jacob Puliyel published in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics in 2012 wrote about the Gates-CDC-WHO mass oral polio vaccine effort there: “… while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated…”The 1950sDefining away cases of poliomyelitis or Infantile Paralysis as it was called during the epidemic in the USA after World War II, went back to the 1950s, and to since-suppressed deadly scandals involving the first purported polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk. Regarded today as a medical hero, the truth of Salk was anything but heroic.The upsurge in cases of what were then labelled poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis in the United States began to literally explode around 1946. Relevant to note is that a highly dangerous cumulative toxin, a now-banned insecticide known as DDT, was being promoted by the US government as a “safe” control of mosquitoes and flies said to be the “carriers” of polio virus. What has since been all but erased from the government record is the precise match of the number of cases of children with symptoms of acute polio with the degree of acute DDT spraying, and the equally precise mirrored decline of human polio cases from the late 1940s into the 1950s, after a sharp decline in DDT use. In 1953, Connecticut physician, Morton S. Biskind argued in public that, “the most obvious explanation for the polio epidemic: central nervous system diseases… such as polio are actually the physiological and symptomatic manifestations of the ongoing government- and industry-sponsored inundation of the world’s populace with central nervous system poisons.”The Salk polio vaccine was first deployed in 1955, that is two years after the dramatic decline in registered polio cases. That fact was conveniently forgotten as the narrative was promoted that the new vaccine alone was eradicating the feared polio.Serious evidence was presented by doctors and others to the US Congress that there was a clear connection between the summer polio epidemics to summer-used heavy metal pesticides such as DDT. They were ignored. The promotion of DDT as a harmless insecticide was so pervasive that kids followed behind trucks spraying the streets and swimming pools were sprayed with DDT, believing it harmless. Highly emotional advertising campaigns proclaimed that deadly polio was mysteriously transmitted by insects and that DDT would protect. Farmers were told to repeatedly spray their dairy cows with DDT to ward of the dangerous insects. DDT thus contaminated the milk supply. Use of DDT exploded by the end of the 1940s across the USA. As one person described it, “Concerned parents went further to protect their children. They feared the invisible virus as if it were hunting their children. They turned their homes into sterile zones by constantly spraying insecticides and washing down the walls with disinfectants.” That sounds familiar.Salk and RockefellerThe vaccine research of Jonas Salk as well as of his rival, Albert Sabin, was funded by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, later known as the March of Dimes. Salk convinced the US health authorities in 1954 that his polio vaccine contained only inactive virus (IPV), and was absolutely safe. He was able to convince the regulatory authorities that the “expensive and difficult procedures which had been suggested for the detection of possible residual live virus” in his vaccine should be dispensed with. Field trials of the Salk vaccine in 1954 were exposed by the Journal of the American Statistical Association: “…59 per cent of the trial was worthless because of the lack of adequate controls…” That report was ignored by the US Department of Health and the National Foundation proclaimed the Salk vaccine ready to mass distribute in spring of 1955.Already in 1955 alarming results from the Salk vaccine had emerged. His vaccine, manufactured by Cutter Laboratories, was administered to over four hundred thousand people, mostly school children. Within days, reports of paralysis began surfacing. Within a month, the mass vaccination program against polio had to be suspended. In June of 1956, polio cases began to increase sharply in Chicago in children who had received the Salk vaccine. The National Foundation sent an urgent letter to its members urging them to, “give reassurance that the present Salk vaccine is safe and effective to patients, parents and others in your community who still needlessly doubt it…”Salk’s vaccine had caused seventy thousand cases of muscle weakness, one hundred and sixty-four cases of severe paralysis and ten deaths. Three fourths of the victims remained permanently paralyzed. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare stepped down and the director of the NIH, resigned. The Cutter incident was quickly downplayed by the Government and vaccinations resumed after 21 days pause, using vaccines from Wyeth Labs. Those too produced cases of paralysis.Between 1923 and 1953, before the Salk vaccine’s introduction, the polio death rate in the US had declined on its own by 47 percent; England had observed a similar pattern. Following the use of Salk’s vaccine between 1955 and 1963, cases of polio in the US increased—by 50 percent from 1957 to 1958, and by 80 percent between 1958 and 1959. This was concealed by a US Government change in defining polio, much as the WHO and CDC do today in Africa. Diseases that had previously been grouped together under the umbrella of “polio” began to be reported as separate diseases. One of these was aseptic or viral meningitis, an infectious disease that is difficult to distinguish from poliovirus, or transverse myelitis—a rare spinal cord inflammation, or the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Were all these a result of widespread toxins used in the vaccine? The Government and vaccine industry was not interested in knowing or telling.Finally in 1963 the US Government replaced Salk’s IPV vaccine with an attenuated oral polio vaccine (OPV) developed by Albert Sabin. As a live virus vaccine, it, too, was and is capable of giving its recipients polio or polio symptoms. Salk testified before a Senate subcommittee in 1977 that the Sabin oral polio vaccine had caused most of the polio cases in the US since the early 1960s.Rockefeller eugenics?The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which funded both Salk and his rival Sabin in development of polio vaccines in the 1950’s, was run by two doctors from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research– Dr. Henry Kumm who had spent 23 years with the Rockefeller Institute, and Dr. Thomas Rivers.Henry Kumm went over to the National Foundation in 1951 at the peak of the polio epidemic. In May 1953, Kumm became Director of Polio Research at NFIP. Notably, during World War II Kumm had served as civilian consultant to the Surgeon General of the US Army in Italy, directing field studies for the use of DDT against malarial mosquitoes.Thomas Rivers was from 1922 head of the infectious disease ward at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, becoming the institute’s director in 1937. As chairman of committees on research and vaccine advisory for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, he oversaw the clinical trials of Jonas Salk’s vaccine by Dr Kumm’s group. It could be said that the National Foundation was a mask for a massive Rockefeller polio vaccine project.Polio researcher David Oshisky stated, “In truth, polio was never the raging epidemic portrayed in the media, not even at its height in the 1940s and 1950s. Ten times as many children would die in accidents in those years, and three times as many would die of cancer. Polio’s special status was due, in large part, to the efforts of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, better known as the March of Dimes, which employed the latest techniques in advertising, fund raising and motivational research to turn a horrific but relatively uncommon disease in to the most feared affliction of its time. The genius of the National Polio Foundation lay in its ability to single out polio for special attention, making it seem more ominous than other diseases.” That National Foundation was run by Rockefeller doctors. This is very much what the Gates Foundation is doing with its turbo-charged oral polio vaccine in Africa where polio had almost vanished before the mass vaccine campaign of WHO and Gates.Here the bond of dedication to eugenics and to dangerous vaccines seems to unite both the Rockefellers and Bill Gates, who in many ways is merely the heir and continuation of the deadly eugenics work of the Rockefellers. All this should give pause before regarding the pronouncements of Bill Gates on coronavirus and his favored vaccines as the scientific good truth.Read more at: Journal-Neo.org and VaccineWars.com",10/15/20 0:00,-32.3012037
"Faulty coronavirus tests: Goat, quail and papaya in Tanzania test positive for COVID-19, raising concerns about false positives","(Natural News) Coronavirus test kits in Tanzania have raised suspicions about their accuracy. President John Magufuli expressed during an event that he found them so unreliable due to the fact that certain animals and even a fruit have tested positive for COVID-19.He further stated that the test kits were imported from overseas, but refused to specify where.In order to evaluate the quality of the COVID-19 test kits, security forces in Tanzania obtained non-human samples from a goat, a papaya, a quail and even a sheep. The samples were assigned human names and then shipped off to a laboratory to be tested. Lab technicians who worked on the non-human samples weren’t informed about their true origins.The test results showed that the goat, quail and papaya were found positive for COVID-19, which may have serious implications. According to Magufuli, this means some people could have received positive coronavirus test results despite not actually being infected.This puts into question the country’s actual number of coronavirus cases. As of press time, the country has 509 reported cases of COVID-19, including 21 deaths. However, the actual number of cases could be higher because Tanzania goes days without providing updates.A “dirty game” is going on in Tanzania’s coronavirus testing labMagufuli, who initially downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, suspended the head of testing at Tanzania’s national health laboratory on May 4, one day after he revealed that the lab had tested the non-human samples, noting that there was a “dirty game” going on at the laboratory.Hassan Abbas, chief government spokesman of Tanzania, said that the country has formed a team to conduct further investigations on the laboratory that did the tests. They will release the results of their investigations as soon as they are complete. (Related: African coronavirus cases SPIKE by 43 percent – WHO warns that continent could be the “next epicenter” of the pandemic.)“The equipment or people may be compromised and sometimes it can be sabotage,” said Magufuli in a speech broadcast through the country’s state-run news outlet.Magufuli further cast doubt on the foreign aid Tanzania was receiving, saying that it may not always be “good for this nation” and that they shouldn’t accept all of it.Coronavirus test kits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack MaAfrica’s testing capacity has expanded sharply since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the help of test kits procured from the WHO, the Jack Ma Foundation and other philanthropic organizations.Jack Ma, Chinese billionaire and founder of the Alibaba Group, has donated thousands of test kits and protective gear to African nations. John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said that the Jack Ma Foundation had provided them with a lot of coronavirus test kits.“We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries and providing them with test kits,” said Nkengasong. “We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.”Nkengasong told journalists that the Africa CDC affirmed that the Tanzanian coronavirus test kits are “working very well.” The World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed their confidence in the reliability of the test kits.When questioned regarding the veracity of the coronavirus tests, Matshidiso Moeti, head of WHO Africa, said that the tests procured through their organization and through the donations made by the Jack Ma Foundation were not contaminated with coronavirus.Magufuli turns to alternative sources of aid for coronavirusLosing any trust he had in the WHO and the Africa CDC, Magufuli has stated that he was sending a plane to Madagascar to collect an herbal mix that the country was touting as a cure for COVID-19. The herbal mix has not gone through internationally recognized scientific testing.President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar has claimed that the herbal cure, known in the country as Covid-Organics, shows results within a week and that it has already cured two people so far.Magufuli, in a speech, said that he was communicating with Madagascar regarding this COVID-19 cure. “They have got a medicine,” he said. “The medicine will be brought in the country so that Tanzanians, too, can benefit.”Pandemic.news has the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa and the rest of the world.Sources include:SHTFPlan.comIndependent.co.ukGlobalNews.caWHO.int [PDF]VOANews.comReuters.com",5/10/20 0:00,-22.97390244
"China made defective coronavirus test kits for Tanzania, reveals Africa CDC","(Natural News) The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) revealed Thursday that China was the source of the faulty coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits received by Tanzania. Prior to this, the origin of the test kits — which produced positive results when using samples from a goat and a pawpaw fruit — was unknown.President John Magufuli ordered an investigation into the imported test kits Sunday. He stated that Tanzanian security forces randomly obtained non-human samples, including ones from pawpaw, a goat and a sheep, in order to evaluate the quality of the kits. These samples were then assigned human names and sent to a laboratory to test for the coronavirus.Both the kits from the pawpaw and goat tested positive for COVID-19, according to Magufuli. The lab technicians handling the tests were deliberately not informed about the origins of the samples. Based on the results, Magufuli stated that faulty kits meant were marking some people as positive for the coronavirus even though they were not actually infected.Africa CDC confirms China as the source of faulty kitsDr. John Nkengasong, head of the Africa CDC, responded to the investigation Thursday. He said that the faulty test kits in question were imported to Africa from China, and then sent to Tanzania by the Africa CDC. These kits were donated by China through the Jack Ma Foundation, a charitable organization founded by billionaire Jack Ma.Ma, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group and member of the Communist Party of China, has donated thousands of test kits, masks and protective gear to Africa, where the equipment is being used in nations across the continent. Aside from Tanzania, no other African countries have voiced any complaints about the test kits. (Related: Israel’s Health Ministry bans the use of Chinese coronavirus test kits,)Nkengasong also commented on Magufuli’s allegation that the Africa CDC sent defective kits to Tanzania.“We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries, and providing them with test kits,” stated the Africa CDC chief. “We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.”Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, head of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Africa office, also reacted to Tanzania’s investigation of the test kits.“We are convinced that the tests that have been provided … both through procurement through [WHO’s Africa office] and those that came through Jack Ma donations, were not contaminated with the virus,” Moeti said in a teleconference with journalists on Thursday.Testing lab under investigationTanzania’s government has formed a team of experts to examine the lab that conducted the tests, stated chief government spokesman Hassan Abbas, and it would relay the outcome of the investigation, once results were in.“What the president said was based on initial tests run by using animals … to test the veracity of the test results,” said Abbas. “Our worry was based on empirical findings. Once the team finalizes its work we will know the gravity of the lapses in the machines.”Test issues could affect Africa’s efforts to fight COVID-19If the veracity of Tanzania’s test on the kits is demonstrated, and the test kits or machines proved to be faulty, it’ll be a huge blow to testing efforts in Africa. While the continent’s testing capacity has expanded sharply, Africa has still only carried out around 685 tests per million people, according to Reuters. In comparison, Europe has carried out nearly 17 million tests, or just under 23,000 per million.The WHO has warned that there could be as many as 10 million infections in the continent within the next six months. Additionally, Moeti has warned that the disease could “smoulder” in the region, becoming a fixture in the lives of Africans for years to come unless governments take a more proactive approach.“While COVID-19 likely won’t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will [smolder] in transmission hotspots,” said Moeti. “COVID-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.”As of press time, Tanzania has 509 cases of the coronavirus and 21 death, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Sources include:Independent.co.ukBreitbart.comReuters.comTheGuardian.comCoronavirus.JHU.edu",5/9/20 0:00,-40.99512195
Africa completely unprepared for COVID-19; death numbers could be staggering,"(Natural News) If you thought the coronavirus death toll in places like Italy, Spain and the U.S. was bad, it could really be a drop in the bucket compared to what might happen when the virus takes hold in Africa.Although the 54 countries in Africa have reported less than 20,000 confirmed cases so far, the continent is considered to be weeks behind Europe, and the rate of increase seen in Europe looked quite similar to Africa’s numbers at this stage. The World Health Organization is warning that there could be mass devastation there given how woefully unprepared most countries are for a medical crisis of this magnitude.In fact, for every million people in Africa, there are just five ICU beds. Hospital beds are also in short supply, with the entire continent having just 1.8 hospital beds for every 1,000 people; in France, there are 5.98 beds per 1,000 people.Many Africans are unable to take the precautions that are keeping a lot of us in America and Europe safe, like frequent hand washing. More than half the population lives in highly overcrowded slum areas, and conditions like tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malnutrition are making lots of people there especially vulnerable. With 36 percent of Africans having no access to washing facilities at home, it’s not surprising that experts are predicting absolute devastation.Social distancing measures have already been put in place in many African countries, with some issuing curfews and travel guidelines and others enacting full lockdowns. South Africa and Rwanda have declared a lockdown and banned unnecessary movements. Uganda has closed its borders, imposed a curfew and banned public transport, while Kenya has also imposed a curfew and restricted movement among populated areas. Nigeria, meanwhile, has imposed lockdowns in key cities like Lagos.Without additional intervention, The UN Economic Commission for Africa is warning that more than 1.2 billion Africans could become infected with the disease and 33 million could die before the end of the year; the total population on the continent is 1.3 billion. Their best-case scenario would still see the continent registering 122.8 million infections and 300,000 deaths.They’ve also estimated that as many as 29 million people could be pushed below what is considered the extreme poverty line on account of the virus.Although Africa, like other continents, will suffer greatly from this disease, there is one small comfort, and that’s the fact that much of its population is young. When you look at the high mortality rate of Italy, it’s important to take into account the fact that 23 percent of that country’s population is older than 65 and therefore falls into the category of highest risk. In Africa, on the other hand, just 2 percent of the population is older than 65. That may help stem the mortality rate to some extent.Will the coronavirus measures that work elsewhere be effective in Africa?Some experts have expressed concern that lockdowns might not work as well in many places in Africa as they do in Europe and America. Many people there live day to day and depend on the cash they earn in the market to buy their food, so even a few days of lockdown could plunge them into starvation. Many people may prefer to take their chances and possibly become infected rather than take on the certainty of starvation. Past lockdowns like those meant to curb Ebola in Liberia in 2014 were a disaster and didn’t stop the disease from spreading.It’s a very complicated situation made worse by the fact that much-needed medical supplies are already in short supply around the world. Countries that might normally come to Africa’s aid during health crises are already struggling with their own problems, and help may be very hard to find.Sources for this article include:TheSun.co.ukBBC.comNYPost.com",5/4/20 0:00,-30.6872973
"Google and Facebook are engineered to spread fear about infections, to keep the public ignorant of how the immune system works","(Natural News) In order to control a person’s mind, alter their behavior, and manipulate their emotions and reactions, that person must first be made ignorant and left feeling helpless, with no way to apply knowledge and independently solve their own problems. In their ignorance, a person is made to feel helpless, abiding by authority’s controls to feel safe. As they give away their own power over their life, they become easily controlled and manipulated. This manipulation leads to compliant, subservient behaviors that serve the interests of those who seek to control, of those who seek to govern over others and poison them for profit.Big Tech – Google, Facebook etc. – are engineering mass ignoranceImagine what it would look like if a select entity had the power to make entire populations ignorant – ignorant of their own body, mind and immune system. Imagine if people were told they were facing a “new virus” that they knew nothing about, that their body was incapable of facing. Imagine a feat of manipulation carried out en masse — human minds molded, emotions controlled. This is the reality that is being engineered by Big Tech – primarily Google and Facebook. These entities have created platforms of manipulation that are being used to censor out the most important information on the human immune system, leaving populations clueless and weak, so they can be more readily controlled.Google has a monopoly on data and uses this data to manipulate what people subconsciously interact with online, what they see in advertisements, and what they are allowed to access in searches and news feeds. Google is already more powerful in terms of its control over people’s lives than almost every government on the planet. For example, go to the Google search engine, type in any three digit number followed by “cases.” Virtually every three digit number will pull up multiple stories about that number of coronavirus cases. It’s all about spreading fear of infection, instead of providing knowledge on how people can live normally and give their body what it needs to overcome potential infections.Google has devolved from an open access search engine, to a manipulative platform of thought control. According to Google whistleblowers, Google maintains a blacklist, deciding what people can and cannot search for, while burying important information on health topics. Google and Facebook admit they only allow an official narrative to persist on infectious disease. All information that is allowed must be approved and rubber stamped by the World Health Organization.Dr. Robert Epstein, a behavioral scientist, testified before Congress explaining how Google can use data manipulation and algorithms to manipulate the minds of more than 15 million people in a subsequent election. “And the methods they’re using are invisible, they are subliminal, they are more powerful than most any effects I’ve ever seen in the behavioral science and I’ve been in the behavioral science for almost forty years.”Censorship and blacklisting of knowledge makes populations vulnerable to pharmaceutical agendasZach Vorhies, Google whistle blower and engineer, went public about Google’s internal search engine, which blacklists search terms such as “cancer cures.” Google actively blocks cancer survivor testimony suppressing how cancer can be overcome and burying a vast wealth of scientific studies and knowledge on anti-cancer compounds. This same manipulation is being carried out to spread fear about infections and to keep the public ignorant on how their immune system works. Some of the most important voices have been censored from Big Tech in 2020 because they seek to quell infection fears and provide information that can help people overcome health challenges that plague their mind and body.As for Facebook: its fact checking arm, PolitiFact, is owned by the Poynter Institute, which has received substantial funding from pharmaceutical companies, Google, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. These controllers use Facebook to censor information that can be applied in the home at the onset of an infection and in the hospital system to speed up recovery, prevent complications and save lives from infectious disease. By blocking information on treatment options and keeping the public ignorant on how their immune system works, these pharmaceutical companies and globalists with a psychopathic plot to vaccinate 7 billion people can more readily carry out their nefarious agendas.Stay up to date on Google and Facebook manipulation at BigTech.News.Sources include:Brighteon.comNaturalNews.com",8/26/20 0:00,-36.77852941
Trump setting the stage for wartime retaliation against communist China regime for launching biological weapon attack against the United States,"(Natural News) President Trump and top Trump administration officials are setting the stage for wartime retaliation against communist China for China’s launching of biological warfare against the United States. The goal of this effort is to cause the collapse of the communist regime, which is widely known as the most evil, dishonest and malicious government on the planet.Consider what we know so far:The Wuhan coronavirus was engineered in the Wuhan virology lab in communist China.The virus was deliberately engineered with “gain-of-function” properties to infect and kill humans.After releasing the virus, the Chinese government desperately sought to hide its origins by destroying evidence and executing whistleblowers.At the same time, communist China was conspiring with the WHO to make sure the rest of the world would have a delayed response to the virus by refusing to declare the pandemic a “pandemic.”During all this, China was aggressively buying up PPE supplies all around the world, making sure other nations would experience extreme shortages in masks and other protective equipment as they tried to handle accelerating outbreaks.China also leaned on the WHO to criticize any national efforts to block flights from China, characterizing such moves as “racist.” This allowed infected Chinese to rapidly spread the virus around the world.Even as its own people were widely infected, China continued to run hundreds of flights per day to major cities around the world, including Madrid, Paris, London, New York, Los Angeles, Rio Grande and even Moscow. This was China’s way of exporting the pandemic to other nations .. China’s goals of disrupting the US economy, hurting Trump’s chances of re-election and creating economic chaos were all achieved in just a few months.China launched a biological “Pearl Harbor” against the United StatesNow, President Trump has correctly described the Wuhan coronavirus attack as a “Pearl Harbor” against the United States, saying, “This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center.” That’s important language to recognize, because it’s the language of war. Similarly, in numerous White House pandemic press briefings, Trump has referred to the pandemic as a “war.”Now, we can add Peter Navarro’s comments to the mix, with Navarro saying recently on Fox & Friends:“We are at war, make no mistake about that. The Chinese unleashed a virus on the world.”As RT reports:The rhetoric against China from both Republicans and White House officials has become especially accusatory in recent days.This is on top of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repeatedly insisting there is “enormous evidence” that the Wuhan coronavirus was engineered in a Chinese lab. He also warns that China tried to hide the origins of the virus.As The Independent reports:Mr Pompeo’s statements about the origins of the virus mirror the words of his boss, Donald Trump, who claimed last Thursday that he has seen evidence the coronavirus originated from a medical laboratory in Wuhan.“We can confirm that the Chinese Communist Party did all that it could to make sure that the world didn’t learn in a timely fashion about what was taking place,” Mr Pompeo said. “We’ve seen the fact that they kicked the journalists out. We saw the fact that those who were trying to report on this, medical professionals inside of China, were silenced. They shut down reporting.In March, Beijing tightened its censorship process surrounding medical research of the virus and its origins. It has also taken down various scientific research papers on the virus that were previously published on the web.”Finally, former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, an extremely high-IQ individual who has deep intelligence contacts in Taiwan, is now saying the communist regime (CCP) is headed for collapse.In an interview with The Epoch Times, Bannon says: (emphasis added)We don’t have to have the economy in China collapse. What we have to do is have the Chinese communist party collapse…You may have some perturbations as China reorganizes and gets a new government. It will be like Eastern Europe and these places after the fall of the Soviet union. But think how great it would be with the Chinese people being free, having democracy and having true freedom and not having to have a firewall, not having to have social credit scores and not having everybody like the great hero, Dr. Li (who had to) face torture and had to sign a confession that he was a rumor monger. All that goes away. May the economy go down slightly? Yeah. The economy may go down. It’s not going to be perfect at first, but look, the economy is collapsing in China anyway because of the actions of the Chinese communist party and what they did in this pandemic.The first quarter in China has been terrible. The second quarter has been terrible. The factories aren’t back up and the workers don’t feel safe. Remember we have another whole wave of this in China and it’s not affecting the guys in Beijing because they have total quarantine. If you go out to the fifth ring or sixth ring, you can’t get back into the area around the forbidden city. It’s like a quarantine, right? Because they want to protect themselves. They know how deadly this virus is. So this shows you the hypocrisy of the leadership of the Chinese communist party.That’s what this pandemic, the good that can come out of this pandemic is the freedom of the Chinese people. And people have to understand if you support the Chinese communist party, you’re racist, if you support the Chinese communist party, you’re a xenophobe because you are supporting the worst people on earth to suppress the 1.4 billion people in China. And you’re going to be held accountable. Anybody that backs the regime is going to be held accountable. Okay? There’s absolutely no doubt this regime is going to fall. Just like the Nazis fell just like Mussolini and the fascists fell, just like the commissars and the Soviet union fell. They always fall. The Chinese communist party is the next one to get kicked into the dustbin of history.It begs the question: Does Bannon know something about imminent action against China?It’s all leading up to war against ChinaThe upshot of all this is that Trump and his top officials are setting the stage for retaliatory action against China. Any form of retaliation would be justified under the truth that China launched the first attack wave against the United States by releasing the Wuhan coronavirus and then deliberately spreading it around the world, including to the United States.The bioweapons attack has caused trillions of dollars in economic damage in the United States alone, and it has killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world — a number that will almost certainly turn to millions of deaths once the virus completes its rampage across Africa, Mexico and South America.When attacked with a weapon of mass destruction from an enemy nation, the United States has many options for retaliatory strikes:Economic weapons such as embargoes and trade restrictions.Financial weapons such as nullifying US Treasuries held by China.Geopolitical weapons such as increasing weapon funding and supply for Taiwan.In an even more enticing scenario, the USA could end its official recognition of China and switch its recognition to Taiwan as the rightful China.Cyber weapons, including cyber attacks on China’s infrastructure.Kinetic weapons, including targeted cruise missile strikes on China’s virology labs.Nuclear weapons, which might include tactical nukes that target communist government strongholds.What’s clear is that before war is initiated, a war of words is used to establish the justification of the real war to follow. And that war of words is what we’re seeing now from Navarro, Pompeo and Trump himself. It’s a strong indication that acts of war are in the works and might be deployed without warning.My recent interview with JR Nyquist provides further evidence that war with China may be imminent:Once China collapses, so will the Big Tech censorship regime that takes orders from BeijingIt is time, after all, for the world to isolate communist China and deliberately work to achieve the collapse of that evil, anti-human regime. The collapse of China would also set off enormous shockwaves of freedom around the world as China’s puppets — which include Google, Facebook, Twitter, the Vatican and more — all experience a simultaneous disconnect from the commie bosses who tell them what to do.At least one-third of the US Congress would also experience sudden withdrawal, as they are communist puppets who do the bidding of China. And Sen. Feinstein’s office in California would find itself with nothing to do, since it only serves the interests of China, too.The bottom line is that communist China’s existence is irreconcilable with human freedom, and the implosion of the communist regime would not only set free the 1.4 billion Chinese who live under the oppression of tyranny, it would also end communist China’s infiltration and control over countless institutions around the world that are now allied against humanity: Big Tech, the Vatican, US universities, the US Congress, Hollywood and so on.In essence, China is the greatest enemy of humanity, and if Trump, Pompeo and others were to find a way to obliterate the communist Chinese regime while freeing the Chinese people, it would be the greatest gift to humankind that we could possibly imagine.End the CCP.

Cold war brewing between the US and China as coronavirus outbreak spreads,"(Natural News) The tensions that have mounted since the start of the global coronavirus pandemic have slowly pushed the U.S. and China closer to a new cold war. The political pressures stemming from the pandemic have strengthened hard-liners while making it harder for leaders to back away from escalation.As the virus has killed thousands and savaged economies around the world, officials in Washington and Beijing have continued to heap blame on each other for the virus. Early on, President Donald Trump often referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus.”Meanwhile, Chinese state-owned media and political operatives have slammed the statements of America’s political elites as being “racist and xenophobic.” Beijing has even gone as far as to spin allegations that the epidemic was started by the U.S. military.The outbreak is stirring anger in both countriesOfficials in Washington have quietly pressed for international censure of China’s culpability in the ongoing pandemic. At the same time, they’ve seized upon the crisis to attack the manufacturing and other economic ties that have been built between the countries over the past 40 years.As the outbreak shut down imports from China, many companies found themselves unable to procure the goods they needed to sell to make money. As a result, many U.S. companies started to rethink their supply chains and make plans to move their manufacturing outside of China before the economy ground to a halt.All the while, the tariffs that President Trump imposed on billions of dollars worth of goods from China — and corresponding counter-tariffs from Beijing — remain in place. This has added to the cost of trade while many businesses struggle to stay afloat.The economic toll seems to have pushed bipartisan support for President Trump’s anti-China message in both Congress and in corporate America. Many in the latter have long been disillusioned with the relationship, especially as Beijing continues to refuse to prevent its companies from appropriating the intellectual property and know-how of American firms.Another factor contributing to the growing disenfranchisement with China has been Beijing’s continued crackdowns on dissent and human rights, as well as its aggressive military moves in the South China Sea.In China, on the other hand, U.S. criticism of the country, as well as the economic toll inflicted by the tariffs, has also stirred waves of nationalistic resentment toward the latter.This anger, combined with the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) massive response to fight the epidemic, seems to have strengthened President Xi Jinping’s hold on power, making it easier for him to pursue further crackdowns on dissent.People in China also chafe at President Trump’s effort to blame the pandemic on the nation, seeing it as both unfair and factually wrong. To them, the CPC’s draconian isolation of Hubei province and other hot spots is a model for how to contain and conquer the disease. They also see China as having reached out to other countries to help them as its own crisis has seemingly abated. (Related: “Recovered” coronavirus patients in China are testing positive a second time.)According to David Bachman, a China specialist at the University of Washington in Seattle, the widely accepted narrative within China is that the country is “if not the savior of the world — at least sort of doing more than its fair share to help the rest of the world.”On both sides, public resentment is likely to be intensified by the rising economic cost of the pandemic.Economic pain could make compromise more difficultThe economies of both nations are expected to see their sharpest drops in decades, as businesses get crippled, and millions of people lose their jobs. Political leaders face an unprecedented crisis in which conventional stimulus packages and other time-honored economic policies look to be ineffective.According to analysts, the economic pain will likely make it difficult for both sides to make any compromise, even if a de-escalation could benefit both of them.“I don’t think there’s any way in hell things get better from here,” said Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “An increasingly authoritarian China, mixed with a global growth downturn, mixed with a domestic recession, mixed with a populist president, mixed with an election year, equals an increasingly factious discourse on China.”China’s economy is expected to suffer its slowest growth in more than 40 years. This could threaten the country’s political stability if the CPC fails to make good on its compact with the masses to continue to improve their economic well-being in exchange for their compliance with an often oppressive authoritarian system.However, there are signs that China’s economy could fare better than experts in the West are projecting. According to Nicolas Lardy, a China economy expert at the Petersen Institute for International Economics, Chinese factories have resumed their operations, and power usage has returned to 95 percent of what it was this time last year.In addition to this, Beijing hasn’t felt the need to spur economic growth with massive credit, nor has it provided anything close to the $2 trillion relief package that Washington passed. Had Beijing thought they were headed to a major economic downturn, Lardy explained, they would have injected a lot more stimulus than it already has.Coronavirus killed the trade deal that could have eased tensionsBack in January, there was some hope that tensions would be eased thanks to a large trade deal struck by the two sides. As part of the deal, the Chinese promised to buy millions of dollars more in American farm products and other goods.Thanks to the pandemic, however, that trade deal “is already dead in the water,” states Backman. “There’s no possible way that the targets now are going to be met. And so that’s going to be a source of dissatisfaction on the U.S. side.”The global pandemic “has demonstrated the impossibility of the U.S. and China being coupled closely together,” explained Clyde Prestowitz, former counselor to the Secretary of Commerce during the Reagan administration. “The notion that free trade and globalization are going to tame China and make it more democratic, etcetera, I think this has shown that’s bull.”Sources include:Bakersfield.comLATimes.com",4/14/20 0:00,-23.80660714
