COVID-19 Employer Information for Rail Transit Operators,"How You Can Protect Your Staff and Others and Slow the Spread

Evaluate your workplace to identify scenarios where workers cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from each other and/or customers. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to address these situations to limit the spread of COVID-19. A committee of both workers and management staff may be most effective at recognizing all scenarios.

While protecting workers, it is important to note that control recommendations or interventions to reduce risk to spreading COVID-19 must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task. Approaches to consider may include the following:

Create a COVID-19 Workplace Health and Safety Plan

Review the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and the Resuming Business Toolkit for guidelines and recommendations that all employers can use to protect their employees.

Identify an on-site workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 assessment and control. When developing plans, include all employees in the workplace, for example: staff, utility employees, relief employees, janitorial staff, supervisory staff, rail transit operators, transit station workers, and transit maintenance workers. Develop plans to communicate with passengers entering the transit vehicle regarding modifications to work or service processes. Notify all workers that any COVID-19 concerns should be directed to the identified coordinator.

Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Develop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisals, and ensure employees are aware of these policies. If contractors are employed in the workplace, develop plans to communicate with the contracting company regarding modifications to work processes.

Consider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees on scheduled workdays. Screening options could include having employees self-screen prior to arriving at work or having on-site screening by taking employees’ temperatures and assessing other potential symptoms prior to beginning work. (see CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers) Make sure employees can maintain at least 6 feet of distance while waiting for screening. Make employee health screenings as private as possible and maintain confidentiality of each individual’s medical status and history.



Take action if an employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19.

Immediately separate employees who report with or develop symptoms at work from other employees and arrange for private transport home. These employees should self-isolate and contact their health care provider immediately.

Close off any areas used for prolonged periods of time by the sick person.

Perform cleaning and disinfection after anyone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 has been in the workplace. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect offices, bathrooms, common areas, and shared electronic equipment used by the ill person, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces. If other workers do not have access to these areas or items, wait 24 hours (or as long as possible) before cleaning and disinfecting.

Employees who test positive for COVID-19 should immediately notify their employer of their results. Sick employees should follow CDC recommended steps to self-isolate or seek care. Employees should not return to work until they meet the criteria to discontinue home isolation, in consultation with healthcare providers.



Develop hazard controls using the hierarchy of controls to prevent infection among workers. You may be able to include a combination of controls noted below.

Engineering Controls (Isolate people from the hazards)

Alter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Where possible, establish physical barriers between coworkers and between workers and passengers. Use strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions. Close or limit access to common areas where employees are likely to congregate and interact, such as break rooms, parking lots, and in entrance/exit areas. Consider making foot-traffic single direction in narrow or confined areas in the transit vehicle to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance. Use visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind workers to maintain distance of 6 feet from others, including at their workstation and in break areas. Consider these cues for passengers as well, such as at the entry doors. Place hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol in multiple locations throughout the transit vehicle for workers and passengers. Use touch-free stations where possible. Make sure restrooms have accessible sinks, soap, water, and a way for people to dry their hands (e.g., paper towels, hand dryer).

Alter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.

Consider requiring visitors to the workplace (service personnel, passengers) to also wear cloth face coverings or masks.



Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

PPE is the last step in the hierarchy of controls because it is more difficult to use effectively than other measures. To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. This is why special emphasis is given to administrative and engineering controls when addressing occupational hazards, including when applying guidance to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Protecting Seafood Processing Workers from COVID-19,"Controls

Worker infection prevention recommendations are based on an approach known as the hierarchy of controls. This approach groups actions by their effectiveness in reducing or removing hazards. In most cases, the preferred approach is for management to:

Eliminate a hazard or processes (e.g., screen and monitor workers and exclude sick workers from the workplace). Install engineering controls (e.g., modify workstations, use physical barriers and ventilation). Establish and ensure employees follow administrative controls, including implementing appropriate cleaning, sanitation, and disinfection practices, and safe work practices that reduce exposure or shield workers. Use personal protective equipment (PPE), in accordance with the employer’s hazard assessment, to protect workers from hazards not controlled by engineering and administrative controls alone.

1. Preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into the workplace

Onshore and offshore worksites, particularly in areas where community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is occurring, should consider developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy aimed at preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into the worksite.

Strategies for preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into the worksite include screening for fever, symptoms of and exposure to COVID-19; staying at home and self-monitoring for symptoms for 14 days prior to initial entry to the worksite; testing for SARS-CoV-2, as described in more detail below; and cooperating with federal and SLTT health authorities to facilitate contact tracing if exposures or infections warrant such.

Quarantine before entry to the worksite:

Employers operating offshore worksites (e.g., vessels), in particular, should consider having workers quarantine and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days prior to initial entry (i.e., boarding a vessel) as a strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission onboard the vessel. To ensure adherence, employers should consider providing paid leave during the period of quarantine or should consider the quarantine time as worktime. Note that employers with fewer than 500 employees are eligible for 100% tax creditsexternal icon for Families First Coronavirus Response Act COVID-19 paid leave provided through December 31, 2020, up to certain limits. Offshore workers are in close proximity to one another continuously while working and off duty but otherwise may be isolated from outside exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Onshore worksites may experience similar situations when seasonal workers live in congregate housing, especially in remote and rural areas where they do not have contact with individuals outside of their own cohort. Follow SLTT guidance on quarantine and testing procedures.

Testing of workers:

Testing after a COVID-19 case is identified

CDC’s “Testing Strategy for Coronavirus (COVID-19) in High-Density Critical Infrastructure Workplaces after a COVID-19 Case is Identified” presents options for testing exposed coworkers for use when public health organizations and employers determine testing is needed to help support existing disease control measures. Note that CDC advises that critical infrastructure workers may be permitted to continue workpdf icon at their regular duties following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect themselves, their coworkers, and the community, including continued screening for symptoms. However, if tested, their results must be negative for them to continue working. (See CDC’s Interim Guidance for Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Workers Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19pdf icon.)

A risk-based approach to testing co-workers of a person with confirmed COVID-19 may be applied. Such an approach should take into consideration the likelihood of exposure, which is affected by the characteristics of the workplace and the results of contact investigations. One approach to testing is to establish a priority for testing (for example, CDC’s tiered approach) based on an assessment of risk in the workplace and other factors such as high rates of COVID-19 transmission in the surrounding community or workers’ households. The highest priority would be for testing of co-workers who were exposed to a worker with confirmed COVID-19, beginning 2 days before the individual with COVID-19 became symptomatic (or, for asymptomatic workers, 2 days prior to specimen collection) until the time of isolation. Other co-workers could be tested based on an assessment of risk in the workplace, such as the layout and size of the room, the design and implementation of engineering controls, adherence to administrative controls2, and movement of workers within the area. Other strategies could involve testing all co-workers if a worker tests positive for COVID-19 or testing all co-workers upon identification of an individual with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Testing can also be used in assessing whether workers who have been quarantined due to COVID-19 can return to work.

Testing asymptomatic workers without SARS-CoV-2 exposure

A strategy aimed at reducing introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the work setting through early identification could reduce the risk of widespread transmission. CDC has recommended guidelines for testing for asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 exposure for early identification in special settings. This guidance can be found here. High-density critical infrastructure workplaces, such as seafood processing vessels and facilities where continuity of operations is a high priority, are settings for which these approaches could be considered.

Employers are encouraged to work with SLTT health departments to help inform decision-making about broad-based testing. Before testing large numbers of asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure, the facility should have a plan in place for how it will modify operations based on test results.

Employers planning to incorporate testing into their COVID-19 prevention efforts should ensure the worksite has a testing plan in place based on contingencies informed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

At minimum, the plan should consider the following components:

The priorities for testing of workers, such as the tiered approach described above.

The capacity for workers to receive a single baseline COVID-19 test and receive the results before entering the worksite. Similarly, the capacity for all workers to be tested upon identification of an individual with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or if a worker tests positive for COVID-19. Capacity for continuance of re-testing, as needed, based on the situation.

An arrangement with laboratories to process tests. The test used should be able to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) with greater than 95% sensitivity, greater than 90% specificity, with results obtained rapidly (e.g., within 48 hours). Antibody test results should not be to the sole basis for diagnosing someone with an active SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A procedure for addressing workers that decline or are unable to be tested (e.g., symptomatic worker refusing testing in a worksite with positive COVID-19 cases should be treated as positive).

Testing of new entrants into the workplace and/or those re-entering after a prolonged absence (e.g., one or more days).

Adaptations to other guidance after quarantine and testing:

In worksites in which both quarantine and testing strategies have been implemented, and workers have no contact with individuals outside of their own cohort (e.g., a vessel crew, an isolated population of workers in congregate housing in remote/rural areas with no contact with the community), employers may be able to relax some engineering and administrative control measures, if those measures are otherwise infeasible in the work environment. For example, onboard vessels it may not be feasible to rearrange workstations or modify sleeping quarters. If new members are introduced to a cohort of workers, such as the exchange of a crewmember onboard a vessel, then it may not be appropriate to continue with relaxed infection prevention strategies, unless that new member has also been quarantined and tested as described above.

Consider a program of screening3 workers before they enter the worksite, excluding sick workers from the worksite, and using criteria to ensure safety when workers return to work. This type of program, described in more detail below, should be coordinated to the extent possible with local public health authorities and could consist of the activities described below.

Screening workers for COVID-19

Screening seafood processing workers for COVID-19 signs and symptoms (such as temperature checks) is an optional strategy that employers may use. If implemented for all workers, policies and procedures for screening workers should be developed in consultation with SLTT health officials and occupational medicine professionals.

Options to screen workers for COVID-19 symptoms include:

Screen them before they enter the worksite or board the processing vessel. Provide verbal screening in appropriate languages to determine whether workers have had a fever, respiratory symptoms, or other symptoms in the past 24 hours. Check temperatures of workers at the start of each shift to identify anyone with a fever of 100.4°F or greater (or reported feelings of feverishness). Ensure that screeners: are trained to use temperature monitors and monitors are accurate under conditions of use (such as cold temperatures); and wear appropriate PPE, as described in the next section.



Do not let employees enter the worksite if they have a fever of 100.4°F or greater (or reported feelings of feverishness), or if screening results indicate that they are suspected of having COVID-19. Encourage sick workers to self-isolate and contact a healthcare provider. Provide information on the worksite’s return-to-work policies and procedures to sick workers. Inform human resources, employer health unit (if in place), and supervisor about sick workers (so workers can be moved off schedule during illness and replacements can be assigned, if needed).



For both onshore and offshore employees, ensure that personnel performing screening activities, including temperature checks, are appropriately protected from exposure to potentially infectious workers entering the worksite:

Implement engineering controls, such as physical barriers or dividers or rope and stanchion systems, to maintain at least six feet of distance between screeners and workers being screened.

If screeners need to be within six feet of workers, provide them with appropriate PPE based on the repeated close contact the screeners have with other workers. Such PPE may include gloves, a gown, a face shield, and, at a minimum, a face mask. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (or more protective) may be appropriate for workers performing screening duties and necessary for workers managing a sick employee in the work environment (see below) if that employee has signs or symptoms of COVID-19. If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134 external icon ).



Managing sick workers

When onshore workers report or have symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) upon arrival at work or who become sick during the day, immediately separate them from others at the worksite and send them home.

When offshore workers report or have symptoms, immediately separate them from others on the vessel. Vessel medical staff, management, and telemedicine providers should discuss the disembarkation of patients suspected or known to have COVID-19 with applicable federal, SLTT, and port authorities to ensure the safe disembarkation and medical transportation of the patient.

If workers dwell in employer-provided housing or shared living quarters, it may not be possible to safely send them home to isolate and recuperate. In such instances, develop isolation plans for workers who are suspected of having COVID-19 or who are COVID-19-positive to recuperate without infecting others (i.e., designate a private sleeping space):

In shared living quarters, consider establishing areas for sleep/rest that accommodate single occupancy during the pandemic and a separate bathroom (if available).

Direct vessels to plan for medical evaluation of potentially sick workers. Vessel medical staff, management, and telemedicine providers should discuss the disembarkation of patients suspected or known to have COVID-19 with applicable federal, SLTT, and port authorities to ensure the safe disembarkation and medical transportation of the patient.

Ensure that vessels carry a sufficient quantity of PPE and medical supplies to meet demands while at sea.

See the section below on special considerations for shared living spaces.

Ensure that personnel managing sick employees are appropriately protected from exposure. When personnel need to be within six feet of a sick colleague, appropriate PPE may include gloves, a gown, a face shield and, at a minimum, a face mask. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (or more protective) are necessary for workers managing a sick employee if that employee has signs or symptoms of COVID-19. If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134external icon).

If a worker is confirmed to have COVID-19, inform anyone they have come into contact with (including fellow workers, inspectors, graders, etc.) of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but maintain the sick employee’s confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon. Instruct fellow workers about how to proceed based on the CDC Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure.

If a worker becomes or reports being sick, disinfect the workstation used and any tools or equipment handled by that worker.

Work with SLTT health officials to facilitate the identification of other exposed and potentially exposed individuals, such as coworkers in a facility.

On-site healthcare personnel, such as worksite nurses or emergency medical technicians, should follow appropriate CDC and OSHA guidance for healthcare and emergency response personnel.

Addressing return to work

Critical infrastructure employers have an obligation to manage the continuation of operations and workers’ return to work in ways that best protect the health of workers, their coworkers, and the general public.

Consider providing screening and ongoing medical monitoring of workers, ensuring they wear an appropriate source control device (e.g., cloth face coverings external icon ) in accordance with CDC and OSHA guidance and any SLTT requirements, and implementing social distancing to minimize the chances of workers exposing one another.

) in accordance with CDC and OSHA guidance and any SLTT requirements, and implementing social distancing to minimize the chances of workers exposing one another. Continue to minimize the number of workers present at worksites, balancing the need to protect workers with support for continuing critical operations.

For workers who have not had symptoms of COVID-19

When reintegrating (bringing back) exposed workers with no COVID-19 symptoms to onsite operations, follow the CDC Critical Infrastructure Guidance. Workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 but remain without symptoms, may continue to work, provided they adhere to additional safety precautions. Consult with an occupational health provider and SLTT health officials for help developing the most appropriate plan.

When reintegrating workers with confirmed COVID-19, including those workers who have remained symptom-free, to onsite operations, follow the CDC interim guidance, “Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings.” As noted above, consult with an occupational health provider and SLTT health officials for help developing the most appropriate plan.

For workers who have had symptoms of COVID-19

Workers with COVID-19 who have symptoms and have stayed home (home isolated) should not return to work until they have met the criteria to discontinue home isolation and have consulted with their healthcare providers and SLTT health departments.

As you move forward with continuing essential work, implement strategies to prioritize positions without which critical work would stop. Include an analysis of work tasks, workforce availability at specific worksites, and assessment of hazards associated with the tasks and worksite. You may be able to cross-train workers to perform critical duties at a worksite to minimize the total number of workers needed to continue operations.

The situation is constantly changing, so employers of critical infrastructure workers will need to continue to reassess the virus’s transmission levels in their area and ports and follow recommendations from SLTT and federal officials. This guidance does not replace SLTT directives for businesses.

2. Engineering controls

Configure communal work environments so that workers are spaced at least six feet apart, if possible. Current information about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by people who are infected but have no symptoms supports the need for social distancing and other protective measures within a seafood processing work environment. Changes in production practices may be necessary to maintain appropriate distances among workers.

Modify the alignment or arrangement of workstations, including along processing lines in factories and conveyors used for loading and offloading goods (e.g., raw fish, packaged or frozen seafood), if feasible, so that workers are at least six feet apart in all directions (e.g., side-to-side and when facing one another), when possible. Ideally, modify the alignment of workstations so that workers do not face one another. Consider using markings and signs to remind workers to maintain their location at their station away from each other and practice social distancing on breaks.

Use physical barriers, such as strip curtains, plexiglass or similar materials, or other impermeable dividers or partitions, to separate seafood processing workers from each other, if feasible.

Worksites should consider consulting with a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning engineer to ensure adequate ventilation in work areas to help minimize workers’ potential exposures.

If fans, such as pedestal fans or hard-mounted fans, are used in the worksite, take steps to minimize air from fans blowing from one worker directly at another worker. Personal cooling fans should be removed from the workplace to reduce the potential spread of any airborne or aerosolized viruses. If fans are removed, employers should remain aware of, and take steps to prevent, heat hazardsexternal icon.

Evaluate the need for additional handwashing and hand sanitizing locations that are easily accessible to workers to reduce congestion during shift changes. Determine where handwashing and hand sanitization stations are needed; and consult OSHA’s Sanitation standard (29 CFR 1910.141external icon) and/or FDA’s good manufacturing practices (GMPs)external icon for food processing operations. If possible, choose hand sanitizer stations that are touch-free.

Add additional clock in/out stations, if possible, that are spaced apart, to reduce crowding in these areas. Consider alternatives such as touch-free methods or staggering times for workers to clock in/out.

Remove or rearrange chairs and tables, or add partitions to tables, in break rooms and other areas workers may frequent to increase worker separation. Identify alternative areas to accommodate overflow volume such as training and conference rooms, or using outside tents for break and lunch areas.

3. Administrative controls

Employers should take the following steps to promote social distancing among workers:

Employers may determine that modifying workstations, including processing or production lines, and staggering workers across shifts would help to maintain overall seafood processing capacity while measures to minimize exposure to SARS-CoV-2 are in place. For example, a factory that normally operates on one daytime shift may be able to split workers into more than one shift throughout a 24-hour period. In some seafood processing operations, one shift may need to be reserved for cleaning and sanitizing. Workers and managers should also take steps to manage workplace fatigue.

Monitor and respond to absenteeism at the workplace. Implement plans to continue essential business functions in cases of higher than usual absenteeism.

Review leave policies and incentives:

Review sick leave policies and consider modifying them to make sure that ill workers are not in the workplace. Make sure that employees are aware of and understand these policies.

Analyze any incentive programs and consider modifying them, if warranted, so that employees are not penalized for taking sick leave if they have COVID-19.

Additional flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave and allowing employees to donate sick leave to each other.

Consider cohorting (grouping together) workers. This can increase the effectiveness of altering the factory’s normal shift schedules by making sure that groups of workers are always assigned to the same shifts with the same coworkers. Cohorting may reduce the spread of infection in the workplace by minimizing the number of different individuals who come into close contact with each other over the course of a week. Cohorting may also reduce the number of workers quarantined because of exposure to the virus. Consider extending cohorting to transportation and communal housing where possible.

Establish a system for employees to alert their supervisors if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or if they have had recent close contact with a person who has suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

Evaluate existing handwashing/hand sanitizing requirements and practices.

Employers may need to implement a multi-step hand sanitizing procedure to ensure effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and conformity with GMPs. Washing hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds can help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, GMPs in food processing may necessitate use of dip stations with 100-200 ppm chlorine or 12.5-25 ppm iodine to control pathogens associated with foodborne illness. Consult with the dip solution manufacturer and EPA guidanceexternal icon to determine whether the dip stations used in a particular facility are also effective against SARS-CoV-2. If alcohol-based hand sanitizer is made available for use in areas where it is allowed under GMPs and to supplement hand washing, it should contain at least 60% alcohol to be effective against SARS-CoV-2.

Food processing employers should consider developing written policies about which employees can use hand sanitizer, in what areas or parts of a processing worksite it can be used, and other considerations pertinent to the food processing environment. Hand sanitizers are not intended to replace handwashing in food production and retailexternal icon settings. Instead, hand sanitizers may be used in addition to or in combination with proper handwashing.

Consider posting additional visual cues reminding employees of the importance of hand hygiene. Monitor the implementation of these requirements.

Ensure workers have access to and frequently use appropriate hand hygiene facilities. Give employees enough time to wash and dry their hands, and provide accessible sinks, soap, water, and a way to dry their hands (e.g., paper towels, hand dryer). See OSHA’s Sanitation standard (29 CFR 1910.141 external icon ).

). Place hand sanitizers and/or drip stations in multiple locations, as appropriate, to encourage hand hygiene.

See additional discussion of hand sanitizers in the Engineering Controls section, above.

Consider other workplace programs to promote personal hygiene, such as:",4/30/20 0:00,
COVID-19 Employer Information for Warehousing,"Evaluate your workplace to identify scenarios where workers cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from each other and customers. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to address these situations to limit the spread of COVID-19. A committee of both workers and management may be most effective at recognizing all scenarios.

While protecting workers, it is important to note that control recommendations or interventions to reduce risk of COVID-19 must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task. Approaches to consider may include the following:

Create a COVID-19 Workplace Health and Safety Plan

Review the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and the Resuming Business Toolkit for guidelines and recommendations that all employers can use to protect their employees.

Continue to follow any state or local regulations for warehousing in addition to the recommendations here.

Identify an on-site workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 assessment and control. When developing plans, include all employees in the workplace, for example: operational staff, utility employees, relief employees, janitorial staff, maintenance, and supervisory staff. If customers or contractors enter the workspace, develop plans to communicate with them regarding modification to work or service processes. Notify all workers that COVID-19 concerns should be directed to the identified coordinator.

Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Develop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisals, and ensure employees are aware of these policies. If contractors are employed in the workplace, develop plans to communicate with the contracting company regarding modifications to work processes.

Consider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees on scheduled workdays. Screening options could include having employees self-screen before arriving at work or having on-site screening by taking employees’ temperatures and assessing potential symptoms prior to beginning work. (see CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers) Make sure employees can maintain 6 feet of distance while waiting for screening, if done on-site. Make employee health screenings as private as possible and maintain the confidentiality of each individual’s medical status and history.



Take action if an employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19

Immediately separate employees who report with or develop symptoms at work from other employees and arrange for private transport home. These employees should self-isolate and contact their health care provider immediately.

Close off any areas that were used for prolonged periods of time by the sick person, if it is practical to do so.

Perform enhanced cleaning and disinfection after anyone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 has been in the workplace. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect offices, bathrooms, common areas, and shared equipment used by the sick person, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces or objects. If other workers do not have access to these areas or items, wait 24 hours (or as long as possible) before cleaning and disinfecting.

Employees who test positive for COVID-19 should immediately notify their employer of their results. Sick employees should follow CDC recommended steps to self-isolate or seek care. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers.



Develop hazard controls using the hierarchy of controls to prevent infection among workers. You may be able to include a combination of controls noted below.

Engineering Controls (Isolate people from the hazards)

Alter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.

Modify the alignment of workstations where feasible. For example, redesign workstations so workers can be at least six feet apart and are not facing each other. Establish, where possible, physical barriers between workers, and between workers and customers. Use strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions. Close or limit access to common areas where employees are likely to congregate and interact, such as break rooms, parking lots, and in entrance/exit areas. Consider making foot-traffic single direction in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance. Use visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind workers to maintain distance of 6 feet from others, including at their workstation and in break areas. Place handwashing stations or hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol in multiple locations throughout the workplace for workers and customers. Use touch-free stations where possible. Make sure restrooms are well stocked with soap and paper towels. Make sure the workspace is well ventilated external icon . Work with facilities management to adjust the ventilation so that the maximum amount of fresh air is delivered to occupied spaces while maintaining the humidity at 40-60%. If possible, increase filter efficiency of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units to the highest functional level. Portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units may be considered to remove contaminants in the air of poorly ventilated areas. Ensure proper ventilation and that exhaust from air power lift devices are vented away from workers. Additional considerations for improving the building ventilation system can be found in the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and COVID-19 Employer Information for Office Buildings.



Administrative Controls (Change the way people work)

Provide training and other administrative policies to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.

All workers should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease is thought to spread, what the symptoms of the disease are, and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimize the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. Trainings should include the importance of social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet or more when possible), wearing cloth face coverings or masks appropriately, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, not sharing personal items or tools/equipment unless absolutely necessary, and not touching their face, mouth, nose, or eyes. Workers should be encouraged to go home or stay home if they feel sick. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance, and that employees are aware of and understand these policies. Use digital inventory tracking systems to limit personal contact. Conduct virtual meetings. Consider maintaining small groups of workers in teams (cohorting) to reduce the number of coworkers each person is exposed to. Create work zones to separate teams and reduce contact with other workers. Reduce the number of staff on-site at one time by increasing the number of shifts, staggering shifts, decreasing the overlap between shifts, and increasing facility hours of operation. Implement flexible worksites (telework) for office staff to the extent feasible. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. If surfaces are visibly dirty, clean them using a detergent or soap and water before you disinfect them. Use products that are EPA-registered external icon , diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, appropriate for surface disinfection. Provide cleaning materials and conduct targeted and more frequent cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (benches, stands, conveyors, lift assist machines, floors, forklifts, pallet jacks, skids, totes, carts, box cutters, conveyor rollers, ladders, packaging equipment, tablets, phones, paperwork, merchandise, countertops, doorknobs, toilets, tables, light switches, phones, faucets, sinks, keyboards, etc.) Close lines between shifts to disinfect frequently touched surfaces in those areas. Conduct frequent cleaning of employee break rooms, rest areas, and other common areas. Provide employees adequate time and access to soap, clean water, and single use paper towels for handwashing. Remind employees to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, they should use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. In addition to adequate supplies of soap, clean water, and paper towels, provide hand sanitizer, tissues, and no touch waste baskets in the restrooms. Maintain social distancing in the warehouse. Limit the number of people in the warehouse at one time. (Consult state and local guidance if available.) Remind employees that people may be able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19 even if they do not show symptoms. Consider all close interactions (within 6 feet) with employees, customers, and others as a potential source of exposure. Post signs and reminders at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on social distancing, hand hygiene, use of cloth face coverings or masks, and cough and sneeze etiquette. Signs should be accessible for people with disabilities, easy to understand, and may include signs for non-English speakers, as needed. Post a contact number outside the facility for visitors and drivers and clearly designate a meeting location where social distancing can be maintained and important information on COVID precautions can be shared. Communication and training should be accessible for people with disabilities, easy to understand, in preferred language(s) spoken or read by the employees, and include accurate and timely information. Emphasize use of images (infographics) that account for language differences. Training should be reinforced with signs (preferably infographics), placed in strategic locations. CDC has free, simple posters available to download and print, some of which are translated into different languages. Use cloth face coverings or masks as appropriate. Cloth face coverings or masks are intended to protect other people—not the wearer. They are not considered to be personal protective equipment. Emphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off cloth face coverings or masks to ensure that the worker or the cloth face covering or mask does not become contaminated. Cloth face coverings or masks should be routinely laundered, if possible. Ensure cloth face coverings or masks do not create a new risk (e.g., interferes with driving or vision, or contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth face coverings or masks should also not be worn by anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove it without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth face coverings or masks may not be feasible (e.g., people who are deaf or hard of hearing, have intellectual or developmental disabilities, or sensory sensitivities). Employees should consider carrying a spare cloth face covering or mask. If the cloth face covering or mask becomes wet, visibly soiled, or contaminated at work, it should be removed and stored to be laundered later. Consider requiring visitors to the workplace (service personnel, customers) to also wear cloth face coverings or masks.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

PPE is the last step in the hierarchy of controls because it is more difficult to use effectively than other measures. To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. This is why special emphasis is given to administrative and engineering controls when addressing occupational hazards, including when applying guidance to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, use of PPE such as surgical masks or N95 respirators is being prioritized for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance, unless they were required for your job before the pandemic.",4/30/20 0:00,
COVID-19 Employer Information for Public Health Inspectors,"How you can protect your staff and others and slow the spread

Evaluate your work practices to identify scenarios where workers cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from each other and/or the public. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to address these situations to limit the spread of COVID-19. A committee of both workers and management may be most effective at recognizing all scenarios.

While protecting workers, it is important to note that control recommendations or interventions to reduce risk to COVID-19 must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task. Approaches to consider may include the following:

Create a COVID-19 Workplace Health and Safety Plan

Review the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and the Resuming Business Toolkit for guidelines and recommendations that all employers can use to protect their employees.

Identify an on-site workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 assessment and control. Include representatives of each type of employee in providing input on the COVID-19 workplace health and safety plan. For example, include professional, utility, relief, janitorial, maintenance, administrative, and supervisory staff in the planning. If service personnel and/or the public enter the workplace, develop plans to communicate with them regarding modification to work procedures. Consider off-site field work and travel in the COVID-19 workplace health and safety plan, such as what equipment and materials may be needed to protect public health inspectors during routine inspections and multi-day travel, which could include driving long distances, flying, and staying in overnight lodging. Include public health inspectors and their supervisors, travel preparers, and motor-pool workers in this planning. Notify all workers that any COVID-19 concerns should be directed to the identified coordinator.

Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Develop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisals, and ensure employees are aware of these policies. If contractors are employed in the workplace, develop plans to communicate with the contracting company regarding modifications to work processes.

Consider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees as they report to work. Screening options could include having employees self-screen prior to arriving at work or having on-site screening by taking an employee’s temperature and assessing potential symptoms prior to traveling or reporting to worksites for inspections (see CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers). Make sure employees can maintain at least 6 feet of distance while waiting for screening.

Determine what state and local regulations apply to the locations and facilities being inspected and identify the point of contact for COVID-19 precautions at those facilities. As part of your organization’s COVID-19 workplace health and safety plan, train and equip inspectors to comply with any regulations and infection control protocols in place at the facilities being inspected, if they are at least as protective as your organization’s established infection control protocols.

Take action if an employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection

Immediately separate employees who report with or develop symptoms at work from other employees and arrange for private transport home. These employees should self-isolate and contact their health care provider immediately.

Close off any areas used for prolonged periods of time by the sick person.

Perform cleaning and disinfection after anyone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 has been in the workplace. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect offices, bathrooms, common areas, and shared electronic equipment used by the ill persons, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces. If other workers do not have access to these areas or items, wait 24 hours (or as long as possible) before cleaning and disinfecting. If it has been more than seven days since the person with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 has been in the workplace, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.

Employees who test positive for COVID-19 should immediately notify their employer of their results. Sick employees should follow CDC recommended steps to self-isolate or seek care. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers.

"Interim Guidance for Use of Pooling Procedures in SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic, Screening, and Surveillance Testing","What is pooling? Pooling—sometimes referred to as pool testing or pooled testing—means combining respiratory samples from several people and conducting one laboratory test on the combined pool of samples to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Why is pooling used? Pooling allows laboratories to test more samples with fewer testing materials. It could be useful in scenarios like returning groups of workers to a workplace. What happens if the pooled test result is negative? If a pooled test result is negative, then all the samples can be presumed negative with the single test. In other words, all of the people who provided samples can be assumed to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. What happens if the pooled test result is positive? If the pooled test result is positive, each of the samples in the pool will need to be tested individually to determine which samples are positive. When should pooling be used? Pooling should be used only in areas or situations where the number of positive test results is expected to be low—for example in areas with a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Definitions of Diagnostic, Screening, and Surveillance Testing for SARS-CoV-2

Definition of Diagnostic Testing

Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to identify occurrence at the individual level and is performed when there is a reason to suspect that an individual may be infected, such as having symptoms or suspected recent exposure, or to determine resolution of infection. Examples of diagnostic testing include testing symptomatic individuals who present to their healthcare provider, testing individuals through contact tracing efforts, testing individuals who indicate that they were exposed to someone with a confirmed or suspected case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and testing individuals present at an event where an attendee was later confirmed to have COVID-19. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also address diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Definition of Screening Testing

Screening tests for SARS-CoV-2 are intended to identify occurrence at the individual level even if there is no reason to suspect infection—e.g., there is no known exposure. This includes, but is not limited to, screening of non-symptomatic individuals without known exposure with the intent of making decisions based on the test results. Screening tests are intended to identify infected individuals without, or prior to development of, symptoms who may be contagious so that measures can be taken to prevent further transmission. Examples of screening include testing plans developed by a workplace to test its employees, and testing plans developed by a school to test its students, faculty, and staff. In both examples, the intent is to use the screening testing results to determine who may return and the protective measures that will be taken. FDA’s FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also address screening testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Definition of Surveillance Testing

Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 includes ongoing systematic activities, including collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data that are essential to planning, implementing, and evaluating public health practice. Surveillance testing is generally used to monitor for a community- or population-level occurrence, such as an infectious disease outbreak, or to characterize the occurrence once detected, such as looking at the incidence and prevalence of the occurrence. Surveillance testing is used to gain information at a population level, rather than an individual level, and results of surveillance testing can be returned in aggregate to the requesting institution. Surveillance testing may sample a certain percentage of a specific population to monitor for increasing or decreasing prevalence and to determine the population effect from community interventions, such as social distancing. An example of surveillance testing is a plan developed by a state public health department to randomly select and sample a percentage of all individuals in a city on a rolling basis to assess local infection rates and trends. FDA’s FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also address surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Diagnostic or Screening Testing Using a Pooling Strategy

General Guidance

Laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) can use a specimen pooling strategy to expand SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid diagnostic or screening testing capacity when using a test authorized for such use by FDA.

If a pooled test result is negative, then all specimens can be presumed negative with the single test. If the test result is positive or indeterminate, then all the specimens in the pool need to be retested individually. The advantages of this two-stage specimen pooling strategy include preserving testing reagents and resources, reducing the amount of time required to test large numbers of specimens, and lowering the overall cost of testing.

A pooling strategy depends on the community prevalence of virus, and pool size will need to be adjusted accordingly. CDC recommends that laboratories should determine prevalence based on a rolling average of the positivity rate of their own SARS-CoV-2 testing over the previous 7–10 days. Laboratories should use a standardized methodology or calculator that factors in the sensitivity of the assay they are using and their costs of testing to determine when the positivity rate is low enough to justify the implementation of a pooling strategy. Laboratories should also understand and, where appropriate, communicate the limitations associated with pooled testing, which are described in greater detail below.

Regulatory Requirements for Pooling of Diagnostic or Screening Testing

FDA regulates in vitro diagnostic devices and has provided recommendations and information regarding Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests for COVID-19 diagnostic tests in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised) (“Policy for COVID-19 Tests”)external icon and the EUA templates referenced in that policy. COVID-19 assays and test systems used for diagnostic or screening testing, including those used for pooling, must have received an EUA from FDA, and some are being offered under the policies described in FDA’s Policy for COVID-19 Testsexternal icon.

Any SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic device authorized by FDA for use with specimen pooling will be included on FDA’s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon. FDA has also outlined various policies in FDA’s guidance regarding the use of COVID-19 tests prior to authorization. A laboratory that wishes to use pooling with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test assay would be expected to evaluate and validate the performance of an assay for a pooling strategy—recommendations for doing so are included in FDA’s Policy for COVID-19 Testsexternal icon, including the Molecular Diagnostic Template for Laboratoriesexternal icon—and submit an EUA request to FDA. After a laboratory notifies FDA according to the policies in FDA’s guidance, FDA does not intend to object to the laboratory performing the validated pooling strategy while submitting their EUA request and during FDA’s review.

If the laboratory modifies that authorized assay by incorporating alternative components, including extraction methods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instruments, and software versions, the laboratory should evaluate and validate the performance of the component changes, and recommendations for doing so are outlined in Section IV.A.4. of FDA’s Policy for COVID-19 Testsexternal icon. For more information on FDA’s policies and recommendations, please see FDA’s Policy for COVID-19 Testsexternal icon, including FDA’s Molecular Diagnostic Template for Laboratoriesexternal icon, and FDA’s FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon.

Laboratories that conduct diagnostic or screening testing for COVID-19 must also comply with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations. If at any time a facility intends to report patient-specific test results, it must first obtain a CLIA certificate and meet all requirements to perform testing. For more information, see the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service’s (CMS’s) summary of the CLIA regulationspdf iconexternal icon.

Reporting Pooled Diagnostic or Screening Testing Results to Health Departments

Public Law 116-136, § 18115(a), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, requires “every laboratory that performs or analyzes a test that is intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19” to report the results to state, local, tribal, or territory public health departments. On June 4, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services published guidance on COVID-19 Pandemic Response, Laboratory Data Reporting: CARES Act Section 18115pdf iconexternal icon that specifies what additional data must be reported by laboratories along with COVID-19 diagnostic or screening test results.

A CLIA-certified laboratory that allows for pooling must report diagnostic or screening negative test results to the participants in the pool according to the instructions for use of the FDA-authorized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic device that the laboratory used. The test report given to the individuals in the pool should indicate that the testing procedure involved specimen pooling and explain the limitations of that type of testing. The CLIA-certified laboratory must also report those diagnostic or screening negative test results to the local, state, tribal, or territory health department.

The CLIA-certified laboratory should not report positive or indeterminate results of a pooled test to either the participants in the pool, or the local, state, tribal, or territory health department. All participant specimens that were in a pooled test with a positive or indeterminate result should be retested separately, and the subsequent individual diagnostic or screening results must be reported to the local, state, tribal, or territory health department.

Limitations of Pooled Diagnostic or Screening Testing

Based on limited data, using a pooling testing procedure for SARS-CoV-2 has some limitations. In a pooling procedure, the laboratory cannot ensure the diagnostic integrity of an individual specimen because it is combined with other specimens before testing. Specimen integrity can be affected by the quality of swab specimen collection, which could result in some swabs having limited amounts of viral genetic material for detection. Inadequate individual specimens, including those with limited amounts of viral genetic material, might not be eliminated from the pooled specimen before testing. Even if each individual specimen in a pool is adequate, the specimens in a pooled procedure are diluted, which could result in a low concentration of viral genetic material below the limit of detection of a given test. These limitations mean that monitoring the prevalence of disease and properly validating the assay and the instrumentation are important to limit the potential for false-negative results. In general, the larger the pool of specimens, the higher the likelihood of generating false-negative results.

The prevalence of COVID-19 in a population also affects the efficiency of pooled testing strategies. In general, lower disease prevalence may enable a laboratory to use a larger optimal pool size. A recent studyexternal icon by the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory found that nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 reliably returned a positive result when one positive sample was mixed with four negatives, and could reduce the number of tests needed by >50% in certain scenarios (such as a COVID-19 prevalence of 5%). However, as the prevalence of COVID-19 increases, the cost savings of a pooling strategy decreases because more pooled tests will return positive results and those specimens will need to be retested individually.

CDC continues to pursue research studies on pooling strategies for testing for SARS-CoV-2 and will update this guidance as needed.

Surveillance Testing Using a Pooling Strategy

General Guidance

Surveillance testing can be conducted in a laboratory that has a CLIA certificate, or in a laboratory that does not have a CLIA certificate. In its Frequently Asked Questions: SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance Testingpdf iconexternal icon, CMS indicates (CMS FAQs: SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance Testingpdf iconexternal icon) that during the COVID-19 public health emergency and associated authorizations, “facilities performing SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing using a pooled sampling procedure to report non patient-specific SARS-CoV-2 cohort results will not require CLIA certification.” FDA’s FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon state that FDA generally does not regulate surveillance testing.

A specimen pooling strategy can expand a laboratory’s capacity to conduct SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid surveillance testing. If a pooled test result is negative, then all specimens can be presumed negative with the single test. If the test result is positive or indeterminate, then all the specimens in the pool need to be retested individually. The advantages of this two-stage specimen pooling strategy include preserving testing reagents and resources, reducing the amount of time required to test large numbers of specimens, and lowering the overall cost of testing.

A pooling strategy should only be used when the prevalence of COVID-19 is low. CDC recommends that laboratories should determine prevalence based on a rolling average of the positivity rate of their own SARS-CoV-2 testing over the previous 7–10 days. Laboratories should use a standardized methodology or calculator that factors in the sensitivity of the assay they are using and their costs of testing to determine when the positivity rate is low enough to justify the implementation of a pooling strategy. Laboratories should also understand the limitations associated with pooled testing, which are described in greater detail below.

Assays and Test Systems for Pooling of Surveillance Testing

Although FDA generally does not regulate surveillance testing, CDC recommends that laboratories conducting surveillance testing with pooling should use an assay and test system that has received an EUA from FDA. Using an FDA-authorized assay and test system helps ensure the quality and reliability of testing. FDA authorized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic devices are included on FDA’s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon. Laboratories should use an existing authorized nucleic acid assay, and, if not authorized for use with pooling, evaluate and validate the performance of that assay for a pooling strategy according to FDA’s guidance in its Molecular Diagnostic Template for Laboratoriesexternal icon. If laboratories modify the authorized assay by incorporating alternative components, including extraction methods, PCR instruments, and software versions, for the purposes of a pooling strategy, the laboratories should also evaluate and validate the performance of the altered test system.

Reporting Pooled Surveillance Testing Results

Results of surveillance testing can be returned in aggregate to the requesting institution, such as a university or public health agency. Negative pooled surveillance test results should be reported as “presumptive negative” to the requesting institution. Positive and indeterminate pooled surveillance test results should not be reported to the requesting institution; they should be retested individually before being reported in aggregate.

Facilities, regardless of their CLIA status, should not officially report the results of surveillance testing, including surveillance testing that uses a pooling procedure, to the local, state, tribal, or territory health department as diagnostic or screening test results. If a local, state, tribal, or territory health department requests access to the results of surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 that uses a pooling procedure, the laboratory should state in the report to the health department that the data are pooled surveillance testing results that do not represent COVID-19 diagnostic or screening test results.

Only a facility with a CLIA certificate may officially report a patient-specific diagnostic or screening COVID-19 test result to the local, state, tribal, or territory health department.

Facilities that conduct surveillance testing, including surveillance testing that uses a pooling procedure, should not report test results to individuals whose specimens have been tested, or to the individual’s health care provider, employer, etc. If at any time a facility intends to report a patient-specific test result, it must first obtain a CLIA certificate and meet all requirements to perform testing. For more information, see CMS’s summary of the CLIA regulationspdf iconexternal icon.

Testing Guidelines for Nursing Homes,"Note: This document is intended to provide guidance on the appropriate use of testing among nursing home residents and does not address payment decisions or insurance coverage of such testing, except as may be otherwise referenced (or prescribed) by another entity or federal or state agency.

Nursing home residents are at high risk for infection, serious illness, and death from COVID-19. Testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in respiratory specimens can detect current infections (referred to here as viral testing) among residents in nursing homes. Viral testing of residents in nursing homes, with authorized nucleic acid or antigen detection assays, is an important addition to other infection prevention and control (IPC) recommendations aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 from entering nursing homes, detecting cases quickly, and stopping transmission. This guideline is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and will be refined and updated as more information becomes available.

Testing conducted at nursing homes should be implemented in addition to recommended IPC measures. Facilities should have a plan for testing residents for SARS-CoV-2. Additional information about the components of the testing plan are available in the CDC guidance titled Preparing for COVID-19 in Nursing Homes.

Testing practices should aim for rapid turnaround times (e.g., less than 24 hours) in order to facilitate effective interventions. Testing the same resident more than once in a 24-hour period is not recommended. Antibody (serologic) test results generally should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose an active SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used to inform IPC actions.

While this guidance focuses on testing in nursing homes, several of the recommendations such as testing residents with signs or symptoms of COVID-19 and testing asymptomatic close contacts should also be applied to other long-term care facilities (e.g., assisted living facilities, intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, institutions for mental disease, and psychiatric residential treatment facilities).

For additional guidance on testing, refer to the Guidance for SARS-CoV-2 Point-of-Care Testing. For additional guidance addressing other non-healthcare settings, refer to the CDC guidance addressing Communities, Schools, Workplaces and Events. Guidance for testing healthcare personnel (HCP) is available in the Interim Guidance on Testing Healthcare Personnel for SARS-CoV-2.

Diagnostic Testing

Testing residents with signs or symptoms of COVID-19

At least daily, take the temperature of all residents and ask them if they have any COVID-19 symptoms . Perform viral testing of any resident who has signs or symptoms of COVID-19. Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a resident has signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and whether the resident should be tested. Individuals with COVID-19 may not show common symptoms such as fever or respiratory symptoms. Some may present with only mild symptoms or other less common symptoms. Clinicians are encouraged to consider testing for other causes of respiratory illness, such as influenza, in addition to testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Perform viral testing of any resident who has signs or symptoms of COVID-19.

Testing asymptomatic residents with known or suspected exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2, including close and expanded contacts (e.g., there is an outbreak in the facility)

Perform expanded viral testing of all residents in the nursing home if there is an outbreak in the facility (i.e., a new SARS-CoV-2 infection in any HCP or any nursing home-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident). A single new case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in any HCP or a nursing home-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident should be considered an outbreak. When one case is detected in a nursing home, there are often other residents and HCP who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 who can continue to spread the infection, even if they are asymptomatic. Performing viral testing of all residents as soon as there is a new confirmed case in the facility will identify infected residents quickly, in order to assist in their clinical management and allow rapid implementation of IPC interventions (e.g., isolation, cohorting, use of personal protective equipment) to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. When undertaking facility-wide viral testing, facility leadership should expect to identify multiple asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection and be prepared to cohort residents. See Public Health Response to COVID-19 in Nursing Homes for more details. If viral testing capacity is limited, CDC suggests first directing testing to residents who are close contacts (e.g., on the same unit or floor of a new confirmed case or cared for by infected HCP). See Considerations for Performing Facility-wide SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Nursing Homes for additional details.

residents in the nursing home if there is an outbreak in the facility (i.e., a new SARS-CoV-2 infection in any HCP or any nursing home-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident).

Initial (baseline) testing of asymptomatic residents without known or suspected exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2 is part of the recommended reopening process

Perform initial viral testing of each resident in a nursing home as part of the recommended reopening process pdf icon external icon . In any nursing home, initial viral testing of each resident (who is not known to have previously been diagnosed with COVID-19) is recommended because of the high likelihood of exposure during a pandemic, transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the risk of complications among residents following infection. The results of viral testing inform care decisions, infection control interventions, and placement decisions (e.g., cohorting decisions) relevant to that resident.

.

Testing to determine resolution of infection

A test-based strategy, which requires serial tests and improvement of symptoms, could be considered for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions earlier than the symptom-based strategy. However, in most cases, the test-based strategy results in prolonged isolation of residents who continue to shed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA but are no longer infectious. A test-based strategy could also be considered for some residents (e.g., those who are severely immunocompromised) in consultation with local infectious diseases experts if concerns exist for the resident being infectious for more than 20 days. In all other circumstances, the symptom-based strategy should be used to determine when to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions.

Repeat Testing in Coordination with the Health Department

Non-diagnostic testing of asymptomatic residents without known or suspected exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2 (apart from the initial testing referenced above)

After initially performing viral testing of all residents in response to an outbreak, CDC recommends repeat testing to ensure there are no new infections among residents and HCP and that transmission has been terminated as described below. Repeat testing should be coordinated with the local, territorial, or state health department.

Continue repeat viral testing of all previously negative residents, generally every 3 days to 7 days, until the testing identifies no new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents or HCP for a period of at least 14 days since the most recent positive result. This follow-up viral testing can assist in the clinical management of infected residents and in the implementation of infection control interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. If viral test capacity is limited, CDC suggests directing repeat rounds of testing to residents who leave and return to the facility (e.g., for outpatient dialysis) or have known exposure to a case (e.g., roommates of cases or those cared for by a HCP with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection). For large facilities with limited viral test capacity, testing only residents on affected units could be considered, especially if facility-wide repeat viral testing demonstrates no transmission beyond a limited number of units.

Evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Animals,"This guidance is intended to guide decisions and help prioritize situations that may warrant SARS-CoV-2 testing in mammalian animal species given limited resources. The decision to test an animal, including companion animals, livestock, and wild or zoo animals, should be made collaboratively using a One Health approach between local, state, and/or federal public health and animal health officials. Animal testing for SARS-CoV-2 is available if public health and animal health officials agree the animal’s case merits testing. Table 1 (below) is not intended to be prescriptive, but is rather intended to help guide priorities given limited resources. Routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended. Confirmatory testing through USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) is not currently available for non-mammalian animals including reptiles, amphibians, birds, or fish.

Currently, there is no evidence that animals can transmit this virus to people. In some rare situations, people have spread this virus to certain types of animals. Veterinarians are strongly encouraged to rule out other, more common causes of illness in animals before considering SARS-CoV-2 testing. To discuss testing an animal for SARS-CoV-2 in certain circumstances, veterinarians should contact their state public health veterinarianpdf iconexternal icon1 or designated state official responsible for animal-related issues in public health; and/or their state animal health officialexternal icon2.

Limited information is currently available to characterize SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals; please visit CDC’s COVID-19 and Animals page for the most up-to-date information. Clinical criteria for considering testing for SARS-CoV-2 in animals is based on what is currently known about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and is subject to change as additional information becomes available.

Human patients with COVID-19 have symptoms that appear 2-14 days after exposure and include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals is currently unknown, but animals may present with a combination of respiratory symptoms or gastrointestinal illness based on presentation in a small number of animals and what is known about other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-13. Veterinarians should use their best judgment to determine if an animal has been exposed to people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and if the animal has clinical signs compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection3. Table 1 describes epidemiological risk factors and clinical features that can help guide decisions regarding animal testing.

If public health and animal health2 officials determine that testing an animal for SARS-CoV-2 is appropriate, coordination between One Health partners will be needed. Please refer to USDA’s FAQsexternal icon for sample collection, transport, storage, and result reporting. If samples are sent to state animal health, university, or private laboratories for initial testing, duplicate samples should be collected because any positive samples must be confirmed through additional testing by NVSL. USDA is responsible for reporting any animal that tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the United States to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)external icon.",2/11/20 0:00,
Interim Guidance for SARS-CoV-2 Testing in North American Wildlife,"Testing may be considered when:

Morbidity and mortality event-based surveillance including detection in wildlife with clinical signs or post-mortem lesions consistent with a coronavirus infection (i.e., respiratory or gastrointestinal signs)1 and in animals that are found dead or are euthanized when there is cause for suspicion of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Threatened or endangered species or species of special concern, particularly wildlife with clinical signs consistent with coronavirus infection (i.e., respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical signs),1 and testing to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in endangered and vulnerable populations.

Biological sample collection and testing

Preferred samples for virus isolation and viral nucleic acid testing include nasal swab, oropharyngeal swab, and/or rectal swab. Samples may also be taken from internal organs collected post-mortem, or a fecal sample may be used in situations where direct sampling is not possible or may compromise animal welfare. Contact the laboratory in advance for instructions on proper sample collection, storage, and transport, and use appropriate personal protective equipment pdf icon[325 Kb, 6 pages]external icon when collecting samples.

Laboratories testing for SARS-CoV-2 should use a validated test, have established protocols, and conduct testing under appropriate biosafety conditions. Currently, there is little information on the sensitivity or specificity of various diagnostic assays among different animal species, and there is no standardized, validated test in animals. Therefore, decisions relying on the ability to predict the true presence or absence of the virus—for example, in situations when wildlife are released from captivity—should be considered in this context. As testing capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 increase and we learn more about this virus, the recommendations for testing in wildlife species will be updated.

Collaboration and reporting

Wildlife health specialists who are submitting samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing should communicate with relevant state wildlife veterinarians, state public health veterinarians, and state animal health officials to ensure they are aware of and able to participate in decisions about testing. Federal partners at the U.S. Department of the Interior, CDC, and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are also available to consult on testing decisions, test interpretation, human health, and animal management. If a SARS-CoV-2 test is positive, wildlife health specialists should communicate the results promptly with state and federal One Health partners and submit samples to the USDA APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL)external icon for confirmatory testing. NVSL will report positive results to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Results should not be released publicly until confirmatory testing has been completed and coordinated among relevant partners. These confirmatory testing and reporting responsibilities apply to all unintentionally exposed wildlife. Results from intentional exposure as part of a controlled research study in a laboratory do not need to be immediately reported to the OIE and should be provided to the OIE in a summary report.",2/11/20 0:00,

Clinical Presentation

Incubation period

The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to extend to 14 days, with a median time of 4-5 days from exposure to symptoms onset.1-3 One study reported that 97.5% of persons with COVID-19 who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection.3

Presentation

The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 present at illness onset vary, but over the course of the disease, most persons with COVID-19 will experience the following1,4-9: Fever or chills

Cough

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Fatigue

Muscle or body aches

Headache

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Congestion or runny nose

Nausea or vomiting

Diarrhea

Symptoms differ with severity of disease. For example, fever, cough, and shortness of breath are more commonly reported among people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 than among those with milder disease (non-hospitalized patients). Atypical presentations occur often, and older adults and persons with medical comorbidities may have delayed presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms.10,14 In one study of 1,099 hospitalized patients, fever was present in only 44% at hospital admission but eventually developed in 89% during hospitalization.1 Fatigue, headache, and muscle aches (myalgia) are among the most commonly reported symptoms in people who are not hospitalized, and sore throat and nasal congestion or runny nose (rhinorrhea) also may be prominent symptoms. Many people with COVID-19 experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, sometimes prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms.9 Loss of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia) preceding the onset of respiratory symptoms has been commonly reported in COVID-19 especially among women and young or middle-aged patients who do not require hospitalization.11,12 While many of the symptoms of COVID-19 are common to other respiratory or viral illnesses, anosmia appears to be more specific to COVID-19.12

Several studies have reported that the signs Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to adults vary by age of the child, and are usually milder compared to adults.15-19 For more information on the clinical presentation and course among children, see Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers.

Asymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Infection

Several studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and in patients not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic).16,18,20-30 Since asymptomatic persons are not routinely tested, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and detection of pre-symptomatic infection is not yet well understood. One study found that as many as 13% of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were asymptomatic.16 Another study of skilled nursing facility residents who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 after contact with a healthcare worker with COVID-19 demonstrated that half of the residents were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at the time of contact tracing, evaluation, and testing.27 Patients may have abnormalities on chest imaging before the onset of symptoms.21,22.

Asymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Transmission

Increasing numbers of epidemiologic studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the pre-symptomatic incubation period,21,31-33. Virologic studies using RT-PCR detection have reported tests with low cycle thresholds, indicating larger quantities of viral RNA and viable virus has been cultured from persons with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.25,27,30,34 The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding and transmission risk is not yet clear. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection compared to symptomatic infection is unclear.35

Clinical Course

Illness Severity

The largest cohort reported of >44,000 persons with COVID-19 from China showed that illness severity can range from mild to critical:36

Mild to moderate (mild symptoms up to mild pneumonia): 81%

Severe (dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50% lung involvement on imaging): 14%

Critical (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan system dysfunction): 5%

In this study, all deaths occurred among patients with critical illness, and the overall case fatality rate was 2.3%.36 The case fatality rate among patients with critical disease was 49%.36 Among children in China, illness severity was lower with 94% having asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease; 5% having severe disease; and <1% having critical disease.16 Among U.S. COVID-19 cases with known disposition, the proportion of persons who were hospitalized was 19%.37 The proportion of persons with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 6%.37

Clinical Progression

Among patients who developed severe disease, the median time to dyspnea from the onset of illness or symptoms ranged from 5 to 8 days, the median time to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from the onset of illness or symptoms ranged from 8 to 12 days, and the median time to ICU admission from the onset of illness or symptoms ranged from 10 to 12 days.5,6,10,11 Clinicians should be aware of the potential for some patients to rapidly deteriorate one week after illness onset. Among all hospitalized patients, a range of 26% to 32% of patients were admitted to the ICU.6,8,11 Among all patients, a range of 3% to 17% developed ARDS compared to a range of 20% to 42% for hospitalized patients and 67% to 85% for patients admitted to the ICU.1,4-6,8,11 Mortality among patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 39% to 72% depending on the study and characteristics of patient population.5,8,10,11 The median length of hospitalization among survivors was 10 to 13 days.1,6,8

Risk Factors for Severe Illness

Age is a strong risk factor for severe illness, complications, and death.1,6,8,14,36-40 Among >44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, the case fatality rate was highest among older persons: ≥80 years, 14.8%; 70–79 years, 8.0%; 60–69 years, 3.6%; 50–59 years, 1.3%; 40–49 years, 0.4%; <40 years, 0.2%.36,41 In early U.S. epidemiologic data, case fatality was highest in persons aged ≥85 years (range 10%–27%), followed by those aged 65-84 years (3%–11%), aged 55-64 years (1%–3%), and aged <55 years (<1%).37

Patients in China with no reported underlying medical conditions had an overall case fatality of 0.9%. Case fatality was higher for patients with comorbidities: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for those with diabetes, and approximately 6% for those with chronic respiratory disease, or cancer.1,6,14,36,38,41,42 Prior stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease have all been associated with increased illness severity and adverse outcomes. Serious heart conditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. People with hypertension may be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and should continue to take their medications as prescribed. At this time, people whose only underlying medical condition is hypertension are not considered to be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.43,44

Accounting for differences in age and prevalence of underlying condition, mortality associated with COVID-19 reported in the United States has been similar to reports from China.26,37,39

Reinfection

To date, reports of reinfection have been infrequent. Similar to other human coronaviruses where studies have demonstrated reinfection, the probability of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is expected to increase with time after recovery from initial infection due to waning immunity and possibly genetic drift. Risk of reinfection depends on the likelihood of re-exposure to infectious cases of COVID-19. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we expect to see more cases of reinfection.

Viral Testing

Diagnosis of COVID-19 requires detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is better in nasopharynx samples compared to throat samples.34,50 Lower respiratory samples may have better yield than upper respiratory samples.34,50 SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in stool and blood.15,45,47,51 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood may be a marker of severe illness.52 Viral RNA shedding may persist over longer periods among older persons and those who had severe illness requiring hospitalization (median range of viral shedding among hospitalized patients 12–20 days).34,38,45,46,53

Infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and with other respiratory viruses has been reported, and detection of another respiratory pathogen does not rule out COVID-19.54

Laboratory and Radiographic Findings

Laboratory Findings

Lymphopenia is the most common laboratory finding in COVID-19, and is found in as many as 83% of hospitalized patients.1,5 Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, high CRP, and high ferritin levels may be associated with greater illness severity.1,5,6,8,38,55 Elevated D-dimer and lymphopenia have been associated with mortality.8,38 Procalcitonin is typically normal on admission, but may increase among those admitted to an ICU.4-6 Patients with critical illness had high plasma levels of inflammatory makers, suggesting potential immune dysregulation.5,56

Radiographic Findings

Chest radiographs of patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral air-space consolidation, though patients may have unremarkable chest radiographs early in the disease.1,5,57 Chest CT images from patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral, peripheral ground glass opacities.4,8,36,58-67 Because this chest CT imaging pattern is non-specific and overlaps with other infections, the diagnostic value of chest CT imaging for COVID-19 may be low and dependent upon radiographic interpretation.59,68 One study found that 56% of patients who presented within two days of diagnosis had a normal CT.60 Conversely, other studies have identified chest CT abnormalities in patients prior to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.58,69 Given the variability in chest imaging findings, chest radiograph or CT alone is not recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The American College of Radiology also does not recommend CT for screening, or as a first-line test for diagnosis of COVID-19. (See American College of Radiology Recommendationsexternal icon).

Clinical Management and Treatment

The National Institutes of Health published guidelines on prophylaxis use, testing, and management of patients with COVID-19. For more information, please visit National Institutes of Health: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelinesexternal icon. The recommendations were based on scientific evidence and expert opinion and will be updated as more data become available.

Mild to Moderate Disease

Patients with a mild clinical presentation (absence of viral pneumonia and hypoxia) may not initially require hospitalization, and many patients will be able to manage their illness at home. The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend on the clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, potential risk factors for severe disease, and the ability of the patient to self-isolate at home. Patients with risk factors for severe illness (see People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness) should be monitored closely given the possible risk of progression to severe illness, especially in the second week after symptom onset.5,6,14,38

Severe Disease

Some patients with COVID-19 will have severe disease requiring hospitalization for management. Inpatient management revolves around the supportive management of the most common complications of severe COVID-19: pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis and septic shock, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, and complications from prolonged hospitalization, including secondary bacterial infections, thromboembolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy.1,4-6,14,36,38,70-73

Additional resources and guidance documents on the treatment and management of COVID-19, including inpatient management of critically ill patients, are provided below.

Hypercoagulability and COVID-19

Some patients with COVID-19 may develop signs of a hypercoagulable state and be at increased risk for venous and arterial thrombosis of large and small vessels.74,75 Laboratory abnormalities commonly observed among hospitalized patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy include:

Mild thrombocytopenia

Increased D-dimer levels

Increased fibrin degradation products

Prolonged prothrombin time

Elevated D-dimer levels have been strongly associated with greater risk of death.74,76-79

There are several reports of hospitalized patients with thrombotic complications, most frequently deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.80-82 Other reported manifestations include:

Microvascular thrombosis of the toes

Clotting of catheters

Myocardial injury with ST-segment elevation

Large vessel strokes83-86

The pathogenesis for COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability remains unknown. However, hypoxia and systemic inflammation secondary to COVID-19 may lead to high levels of inflammatory cytokines and activation of the coagulation pathway.

There are limited data available to inform clinical management around prophylaxis or treatment of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients.

Several national professional associations provide resources for up-to-date information concerning COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability, including management of anticoagulation. This is a rapidly evolving topic, with new information released often.

More information on hypercoagulability and COVID-19 is available from the American Society of Hematology external iconand National Institutes of Health: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelines – Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients with COVID-19external icon.

Pediatric Management

Illness among pediatric patients with COVID-19 is typically milder than among adults. Most children present with symptoms of upper respiratory infection. However, severe outcomes have been reported in children, including deaths. Data suggest that infants (<12 months of age) may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared with older children.16 CDC and partners are also investigating reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19.

For expanded guidance on the management of children with COVID-19 and associated complications, see Evaluation and Management Considerations for Neonates At Risk for COVID-19, Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers, and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and Sepsis-Associated Organ Dysfunction in Childrenexternal icon .

Investigational Therapeutics

The National Institutes of Health have published interim guidelines for the medical management of COVID-19external icon which include information on therapeutic options for COVID-19 currently under investigation. No U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials when used to treat patients with COVID-19, although FDA has granted an Emergency Use Authorization for the use of remdesivirexternal icon to treat severe cases. Use of investigational therapies for treatment of COVID-19 should ideally be done in the context of enrollment in randomized controlled trials, so that beneficial drugs can be identified. For the latest information, see Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Patients. For information on registered trials in the United States, see ClinicalTrials.govexternal icon.

Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation

Patients who have clinically recovered and are able to discharge from the hospital, but who have not been cleared from their Transmission-Based Precautions, may continue isolation at their place of residence until cleared. For recommendations on discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or home isolation for patients who have recovered from COVID-19, please see:",2/11/20 0:00,
Duration of Isolation and Precautions for Adults with COVID-19,"Summary of Recent Changes Updates as of October 19, 2020 Added criteria and evidence to address whether people who recovered from COVID-19 and are re-exposed to COVID-19 need to undergo repeat quarantine.

Accumulating evidence supports ending isolation and precautions for persons with COVID-19 using a symptom-based strategy. This update incorporates recent evidence to inform the duration of isolation and precautions recommended to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to others, while limiting unnecessary prolonged isolation and unnecessary use of laboratory testing resources.

Key findings are summarized here.

Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA measured in upper respiratory specimens decline after onset of symptoms (CDC, unpublished data, 2020; Midgley et al., 2020; Young et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020; Wölfel et al., 2020; van Kampen et al., 2020). The likelihood of recovering replication-competent virus also declines after onset of symptoms. For patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, replication-competent virus has not been recovered after 10 days following symptom onset (CDC, unpublished data, 2020; Wölfel et al., 2020; Arons et al., 2020; Bullard et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; personal communication with Young et al., 2020; Korea CDC, 2020). Recovery of replication-competent virus between 10 and 20 days after symptom onset has been documented in some persons with severe COVID-19 that, in some cases, was complicated by immunocompromised state (van Kampen et al., 2020). However, in this series of patients, it was estimated that 88% and 95% of their specimens no longer yielded replication-competent virus after 10 and 15 days, respectively, following symptom onset. A large contact tracing study demonstrated that high-risk household and hospital contacts did not develop infection if their exposure to a case patient started 6 days or more after the case patient’s illness onset (Cheng et al., 2020). Although replication-competent virus was not isolated 3 weeks after symptom onset, recovered patients can continue to have SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in their upper respiratory specimens for up to 12 weeks (Korea CDC, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Xiao et al, 2020). Investigation of 285 “persistently positive” persons, which included 126 persons who had developed recurrent symptoms, found no secondary infections among 790 contacts attributable to contact with these case patients. Efforts to isolate replication-competent virus from 108 of these case patients were unsuccessful (Korea CDC, 2020). Specimens from patients who recovered from an initial COVID-19 illness and subsequently developed new symptoms and retested positive by RT-PCR did not have replication-competent virus detected (Korea CDC, 2020; Lu et al., 2020). The risk of reinfection may be lower in the first 3 months after initial infection, based on limited evidence from another betacoronavirus (HCoV-OC43), the genus to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs (Kiyuka et al, 2018). To date, reports of reinfection have been infrequent. Similar to other human coronaviruses where studies have demonstrated reinfection, the probability of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is expected to increase with time after recovery from initial infection due to waning immunity and possibly genetic drift. Risk of reinfection depends on the likelihood of re-exposure to infectious cases of COVID-19. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we expect to see more cases of reinfection.

The current evidence includes the following caveats:

In a recent study of skilled nursing facility workers followed prospectively for asymptomatic infection, one of 48 infected staff had a nasopharyngeal swab which was weakly positive on a single-passage plaque assay more than 20 days after initial diagnosis; however, the specimen was not subjected to serial passage to demonstrate the presence of replication-competent virus (Quicke et al., 2020).

In one case report, a person with mild illness provided specimens that yielded replication-competent virus for up to 18 days after symptom onset (Liu et al., 2020).

Data currently available are derived from adults; equivalent data from children and infants are not presently available.

More data are needed concerning viral shedding in some situations, including in immunocompromised persons.

Assessment

Available data indicate that persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset. Persons with more severe to critical illness or severe immunocompromise likely remain infectious no longer than 20 days after symptom onset. Recovered persons can continue to shed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory specimens for up to 3 months after illness onset, albeit at concentrations considerably lower than during illness, in ranges where replication-competent virus has not been reliably recovered and infectiousness is unlikely. The etiology of this persistently detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA has yet to be determined. Studies have not found evidence that clinically recovered persons with persistence of viral RNA have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to others. These findings strengthen the justification for relying on a symptom based, rather than test-based strategy for ending isolation of these patients, so that persons who are by current evidence no longer infectious are not kept unnecessarily isolated and excluded from work or other responsibilities.

The duration and robustness of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation. Based on what we know from other related human coronaviruses, people appear to become susceptible to reinfection around 90 days after onset of infection. To date, reinfection appears to be uncommon during the initial 90 days after symptom onset of the preceding infection (Annex: Quarantine of Persons Recovered from Laboratory-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 Infection with Subsequent Re-Exposure). Thus, for persons recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, a positive PCR without new symptoms during the 90 days after illness onset more likely represents persistent shedding of viral RNA than reinfection.

If such a person remains asymptomatic during this 90-day period, then any re-testing is unlikely to yield useful information, even if the person had close contact with an infected person.

If such a person becomes symptomatic during this 90-day period and an evaluation fails to identify a diagnosis other than SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., influenza), then the person may warrant evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in consultation with an infectious disease or infection control expert. Isolation may be warranted during this evaluation, particularly if symptoms developed after close contact with an infected person.

Correlates of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been established. Specifically, the utility of serologic testing to establish the absence or presence of infection or reinfection remains undefined.

The recommendations below are based on the best information available in mid-July 2020 and reflect the realities of an evolving pandemic. Even for pathogens for which many years of data are available, it may not be possible to establish recommendations that ensure 100% of persons who are shedding replication-competent virus remain isolated. CDC will continue to closely monitor the evolving science for information that would warrant reconsideration of these recommendations.

Recommendations

Duration of isolation and precautions For most persons with COVID-19 illness, isolation and precautions can generally be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset 1 and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms. A limited number of persons with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days that may warrant extending duration of isolation and precautions for up to 20 days after symptom onset; consider consultation with infection control experts.

and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms. For persons who never develop symptoms, isolation and other precautions can be discontinued 10 days after the date of their first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Role of viral diagnostic testing (PCR or antigen) 2 to discontinue isolation or precautions For persons who are severely immunocompromised, a test-based strategy could be considered in consultation with infectious diseases experts.

For all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or precautions earlier than would occur under the strategy outlined in Part 1, above. Role of viral diagnostic testing (PCR or antigen) 2 after discontinuation of isolation or precautions For persons previously diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 who remain asymptomatic after recovery, retesting is not recommended within 3 months after the date of symptom onset for the initial COVID-19 infection.

For persons who develop new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during the 3 months after the date of initial symptom onset, if an alternative etiology cannot be identified by a provider, then the person may warrant retesting. Consultation with infectious disease or infection control experts is recommended, especially in the event symptoms develop within 14 days after close contact with an infected person. Persons being evaluated for reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 should be isolated under recommended precautions while undergoing evaluation. If reinfection is confirmed or remains suspected they should remain under the recommended SARS-CoV-2 isolation until they meet the criteria for discontinuation of precautions – for most persons, this would be 10 days after symptom onset and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms.

For persons who never developed symptoms, the date of first positive viral diagnostic test (PCR or antigen) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be used in place of the date of symptom onset. Role of serologic testing Serologic testing should not be used to establish the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or reinfection.

[1] Symptom onset is defined as the date on which symptoms first began, including non-respiratory symptoms.

[2] PCR testing is defined as the use of an RT-PCR assay to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA..

Considerations for Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings,"These infection prevention and control considerations are for healthcare facilities providing obstetric care for pregnant patients with suspected1 or confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in inpatient obstetric healthcare settings including obstetrical triage, labor and delivery, recovery and inpatient postpartum settings.

This information is intended to aid hospitals and clinicians in applying broader CDC interim guidance on infection prevention and control for COVID-19.

Since maternity and newborn care units vary in physical configuration, each facility should consider their appropriate space and staffing needs to prevent transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. These considerations include appropriate isolation of pregnant patients who have suspected1 or confirmed COVID-19; basic and refresher training for all healthcare personnel on those units to include correct adherence to infection control practices and personal protective equipment (PPE) use and handling; and sufficient and appropriate PPE supplies positioned at all points of care.

These considerations are based upon the limited evidence available to date about transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. The approaches outlined below are intentionally cautious until additional data become available to refine recommendations for prevention of person-to-person transmission in inpatient obstetric care settings.

Based on what we know at this time, pregnant people might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people. Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant people with COVID-19.

Prehospital Considerations

Pregnant patients with suspected 1 or confirmed COVID-19 should notify the obstetric unit prior to arrival so the facility can make appropriate infection control preparations such as: identifying the most appropriate room for labor and delivery, ensuring infection prevention and control supplies and PPE are correctly positioned, and informing all healthcare personnel who will be involved in the patient’s care of infection control expectations before the patient’s arrival.

or confirmed COVID-19 should notify the obstetric unit prior to arrival so the facility can make appropriate infection control preparations such as: identifying the most appropriate room for labor and delivery, ensuring infection prevention and control supplies and PPE are correctly positioned, and informing all healthcare personnel who will be involved in the patient’s care of infection control expectations before the patient’s arrival. If a pregnant patient who has suspected 1 or confirmed COVID-19 is arriving via transport by emergency medical services, the driver should contact the receiving emergency department or healthcare facility and follow previously agreed-upon local or regional transport protocols. For more information refer to the Interim Guidance for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems and 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for COVID-19 in the United States.

For more information refer to the Interim Guidance for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems and 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for COVID-19 in the United States. Healthcare providers should promptly notify infection control personnel at their facility of the anticipated arrival of a pregnant patient who has suspected1 or confirmed COVID-19.

During Hospitalization

Pregnant people admitted with suspected 1 COVID-19 or who develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during admission should be prioritized for testing. Testing of asymptomatic pregnant people is at the discretion of the healthcare provider and facility. Healthcare facilities should ensure recommended infection control practices for hospitalized pregnant patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are consistent with Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations.

COVID-19 or who develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during admission should be prioritized for testing. Testing of asymptomatic pregnant people is at the discretion of the healthcare provider and facility. Healthcare facilities should ensure recommended infection control practices for hospitalized pregnant patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are consistent with Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations. All healthcare facilities that provide obstetric care must ensure that their personnel are correctly trained and capable of implementing recommended infection control interventions, including the use of personal protective equipment. Individual healthcare personnel should ensure they understand and can adhere to infection control requirements.

Healthcare facilities providing inpatient obstetrical care should limit visitors to pregnant people who have known or suspected COVID-19 infections. Visitors should be limited to those essential for the pregnant person’s well-being and care (emotional support persons). Depending upon the extent of community-transmission, institutions may consider limiting visitors to one essential support person and having that person be the same individual throughout the hospitalization. Use of alternative mechanisms for patient and visitor interactions, such as video-call applications, can be encouraged for any additional support persons. Any visitors permitted to labor and delivery should be screened for symptoms of COVID-19 and should not be allowed entry if fever or other symptoms are present. Visitors should be informed about use of masks (including cloth face coverings) for any person entering the healthcare facility and about appropriate use of personal protective equipment according to current facility visitor policy. Visitors should be instructed to only visit the patient room and should not go to other locations within the facility, including any newborn nursery.



Considerations for Newborns and Breastfeeding

CDC has developed recommendations for healthcare providers caring for neonates (newborns) at risk for COVID-19, including testing and infection prevention and control considerations, as well as guidance for care of breastfeeding mothers. For more information, visit Evaluation and Management Considerations for Neonates At Risk for COVID-19 and Guidance on Care for Breastfeeding Women.

Disposition

Patients with COVID-19 can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. For more information, see Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Patients with COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings. Meeting criteria for discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions is not a prerequisite for discharge.

Patients who are able to be discharged from the hospital but have not met criteria to discontinue isolation and wish to reduce the risk of transmission to their newborn may continue temporary separation at their place of residence (if feasible) until cleared to discontinue home isolation following either the symptom based strategy or testing based strategy. When temporary separation is being considered, its risks and benefits should be discussed by the mother and the healthcare team. Decisions about temporary separation should be made in accordance with the mother’s wishes. For more information, refer to guidance in the Discontinuation of Home Isolation for Persons with COVID-19.

People who are caring for infants and young children may experience increased stress, feelings of isolation, or loneliness because of social distancing measures during the COVID-19 outbreak or related temporary separation. Postpartum depression symptoms may be worsened because of COVID-19 social distancing measures. Providers are encourage to share resources with patients about coping with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2/11/20 0:00,

AND

In the meantime, follow these steps to prevent others in your household or community from getting sick: Stay home except to get medical care

You should stay home until you talk with your usual healthcare provider or another medical provider. In the meantime, restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care. Do not go to work, school, or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis. Separate yourself from others in your home

As much as possible, you should stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available. Wear a facemask, if possible

If you have cough, runny nose, or sneezing, wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and especially before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then people who live with you should not stay in the same room with you, or they should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Cover your coughs and sneezes

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw used tissues in a lined trash can; immediately wash your hands. Clean your hands often

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid sharing personal household items

You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home. After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water. Clean all “high-touch” surfaces everyday

High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product. Monitor your symptoms

Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening (e.g., difficulty breathing). Put on a facemask before you enter the facility. These steps will help the healthcare provider’s office to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting sick.



Consider Follow Up – Based on your clinic/practice, usual protocol, and/or guidance from your Medical Director, consider placing follow-up calls to any patient advised to contact their provider to ensure that they sought medical advice, assess if their condition has improved or worsened, and to determine final disposition.

F. Contact the occupational health provider at your workplace immediately

Contact an occupational health provider in your healthcare facility as soon as possible.

If you have cared for a person who is sick with COVID-19 or have been in an area with community spread of COVID-19, please let your occupational health provider know as soon as you speak with them.

If your facility does not have an occupational health provider, seek care with your usual provider.

Be sure to mention that you have symptoms and work in a healthcare facility or with patients. If your symptoms get worse, seek care by an urgent care center or emergency department, but call ahead to let them know you are sick, work in a healthcare setting, and may have had exposure to COVID-19.

Considerations for Alternate Care Sites,"Summary of Changes April 6, 2020: Updated to align with the level of care categories defined in the Federal Healthcare Resilience Task Force Alternate Care Sites (ACS) Toolkit: First Edition, which included General (non-acute) Care and Acute Care

April 23, 2020: Updated to align with the level of care categories defined in the Federal Healthcare Resilience Task Force Alternate Care Sites (ACS) Toolkit pdf icon external icon : Second Edition, which include Non-Acute Care, Hospital Care, and Acute Care

Key Concepts

Establishing alternate care sites will help address surge in the response to COVID-19.

Since care will be provided in a non-traditional environment, it is critical to ensure these facilities can support implementation of recommended infection prevention and control practices.

A local surge in the need for medical care might require jurisdictions to establish alternate care sites (ACS) where patients with COVID-19 can remain and receive medical care for the duration of their isolation period. These are typically established in non-traditional environments, such as converted hotels or mobile field medical units.1 Depending on the jurisdictional needs, ACS could provide three levels of care:

Non-Acute Care: General, low‐level care for mildly to moderately symptomatic COVID‐19 patients. These patients may require oxygen (less than or equal to 2L/min), but do not require extensive nursing care or assistance with activities of daily living (ADL). This level of care corresponds to Level 5 (ambulatory care) and Level 4 (minor acuity care) patients in medical care terminology. Hospital Care: Mid-level care for moderately symptomatic COVID-19 patients. These patients require oxygen (more than 2L/min), nursing care, and assistance with ADL. This level of care corresponds to Level 3 (medical-surgical care) patients in medical care terminology. Acute Care: Higher acuity care for COVID‐19 patients. These patients require significant ventilatory support, including intensive monitoring on a ventilator. This level of care corresponds to Level 2 (step-down care) and Level 1 (intensive care unit [ICU] care) patients in medical care terminology.

The expected duration of care for patients in ACS would be based on their clinical needs and potentially the timeline for discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions. If ACS will be used to care for both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients or for patients without COVID-19 who require care for other reasons, additional infection prevention and control considerations will apply. For example, planning would need to address physical separation between the cohorts and assigning different HCP with dedicated equipment to each section.

This guidance provides critical infection prevention and control (IPC) considerations for ACS and is intended to supplement existing plans (created by jurisdictions as part of pandemic planning). It does not address other important aspects of an ACS, such as supplies, accessibility (e.g., doors are wide enough for wheelchairs and stretchers) and patient transportation to and from nearby healthcare facilities. Jurisdictions should consider how close the ACS is to nearby healthcare facilities, including acute care hospitals, and may need to have agreements in place with surrounding healthcare facilities regarding patient transfer.

The ACS Toolkitpdf iconexternal icon is available to provide technical assistance for jurisdictions establishing and operationalizing ACS.

Physical Infrastructure

Component Planning Considerations Examples Component Layout Planning Considerations Layout plan for all areas of the facility, consideration should be given for the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) that should be worn in each area Examples Patient triage

Staff respite area separate from patient care area with a bathroom for staff use only: staff can store personal belongings, take breaks, and eat

Area for staff to put on and remove PPE

Patient care area or rooms with access to patient bathrooms/shower areas

Designated area in patient care area where staff can document and monitor patients

Clean supply area

Medication storage/preparation area

Dirty utility area, that includes space for reprocessing reusable medical equipment Component Air conditioning and heating Planning Considerations Functional HVAC (heating and cooling) system Examples ACS with individual patient rooms (e.g., hotel): ideally a facility whose HVAC units are mounted on an external wall and able to accommodate some outdoor air dilution as opposed to internal, 100% recirculation units

ideally a facility whose HVAC units are mounted on an external wall and able to accommodate some outdoor air dilution as opposed to internal, 100% recirculation units ACS with open floor plan: care is provided in a large open space; ideally the HVAC has air supply at one end of the space and air return at the other end of the space Staff respite area would ideally be in a room separate from the patient care area; at a minimum it should not be in a location near the air return Facilities with generator support are optimal

care is provided in a large open space; ideally the HVAC has air supply at one end of the space and air return at the other end of the space Component Spacing between patients Planning Considerations Determine maximum number of patients who can safely receive care in the facility

Plan for safe spacing between patients Examples ACS with individual patient rooms (e.g., hotel): ideally each patient should have a separate room with a separate bathroom

ideally each patient should have a separate room with a separate bathroom ACS with open floor plan: To prevent the spread of other pathogens, there should be: At least 6 feet of space between beds Physical barrier between beds, if possible Bed placement alternating in a head-to-toe configuration; ideally beds and barriers should be oriented parallel to directional airflow (if applicable)

To prevent the spread of other pathogens, there should be: Component Storage areas Planning Considerations Space for clean storage

Space for dirty storage Examples Clean storage would ideally have a refrigerated section for medications that require refrigeration and a room temperature section for other medications and clean supplies (e.g., linen, PPE)

Dirty storage would have space for medical and non-medical waste and dirty equipment waiting to be reprocessed Component Floors and surfaces Planning Considerations Cleanable floors and surfaces1 Examples Avoid porous surfaces (e.g., upholstered furniture, carpet, and rugs) as much as possible Component Visitor access Planning Considerations Prohibit visitors and pets in order to avoid unnecessary risks to patients and staff; post signage at entrances to the facility indicating this policy Examples

Services

Component Planning Considerations Examples Component Food services Planning Considerations Catering provided with disposable plates/utensils

Separate place for staff to eat without wearing PPE Examples Component Environmental services Planning Considerations Environmental services can be provided regularly and safely by trained staff

Environmental services staff have all necessary training and wear appropriate PPE for exposure to disinfectants and patients with COVID-19

EPA-registered disinfectants from List N external icon are used according to label instructions for routine cleaning and disinfection

are used according to label instructions for routine cleaning and disinfection Protocols are in place for cleaning spills of blood or other body fluids 2

Responsibility for reprocessing reusable medical equipment is assigned to appropriately trained personnel Examples ACS with individual patient rooms (e.g., hotel): environmental services staff perform terminal cleaning of rooms and patients ideally perform daily cleaning Patients should be provided cleaning materials (i.e., disinfectant wipes, gloves) and instructed to clean high-touch surfaces and any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them daily, according to the label instructions Establish a process for at least daily removal of trash from rooms

environmental services staff perform terminal cleaning of rooms and patients ideally perform daily cleaning ACS with open floor plan: environmental services staff would perform both daily and terminal cleaning Wipe-down of all floors and horizontal surfaces at least once daily Immediate clean-up of all spills of blood or body fluids 2 Regular disinfection of high-touch surfaces (e.g., doorknobs) At least daily cleaning of bathrooms

environmental services staff would perform both daily and terminal cleaning Component Sanitation Planning Considerations Sanitation and waste services are available for medical waste (if required); refer to local regulations for handling of medical waste

Sanitation and waste services are available for routine waste Examples Component Laundry facilities Planning Considerations Laundry services are provided in accordance with routine laundering practices using either washer and dryers on site or through a contract with a laundry service Examples Component Pharmacy access Planning Considerations Medications are properly labeled and stored

The layout has designated a space for medication preparation activities that is not in the immediate patient care area and is away from potential sources of contamination (e.g., sink)

Staff who prepare and administer medications have been appropriately trained on methods to prevent medication errors and contamination; those who prepare or administer injectable medications should be educated on safe injection practices such as not reusing single-dose medications or injection practices (e.g., not reusing single-dose medications or injection equipment, preparing medications as close as possible to the time of administration)3 Examples Component Diagnostics Planning Considerations If point of care testing meters (e.g., blood glucose, anticoagulation meters) must be used for more than one patient they should be labeled for multi-patient use and be cleaned and disinfected after each use, according to the instructions for use. Otherwise, each individual should have their own dedicated glucometer for exclusive use at the ACS.

Care must also be taken to ensure that only single-use auto-disabling lancets are used to perform fingerstick procedures for point-of-care testing.

Diagnostic testing should not be performed in the same area where medications are stored or prepared Examples

Patient Care

Component Planning Considerations Examples Component Staffing Planning Considerations Staffing plan (including medical, IPC, occupational health, administrative, and support staff)

Implement sick leave policies for staff/employees that are flexible and non-punitive

Ensure at least one individual with IPC training is included in planning and is regularly available to address questions and concerns. This individual would ensure that staff receive job-specific IPC training, including educating them on hand hygiene, proper selection and use of PPE and to not report to work when ill

Ensure staff have access to occupational health services if they experience a work-place exposure or become ill

Ensure there are staff assigned to perform surveillance for infectious diseases (e.g., infectious diarrhea) Examples Component Infection prevention and control supplies Planning Considerations Necessary infection prevention and control supplies are available at or accessible to staff at the facility Examples Examples of infection prevention and control supplies for both ACS types include: alcohol-based hand sanitizer, soap and paper towels, personal hygiene supplies, PPE, EPA-registered hospital disinfectants from List N external icon , supplies for cleaning and disinfection (e.g., mops, buckets), sharps containers (located near point of use) Component PPE Planning Considerations Necessary PPE are available at or accessible to the facility Examples The layout of the facility might impact the PPE used in each area. At a minimum, staff should wear an N95 respirator (or a facemask if respirator is not available) and eye protection while in the patient care area; respirators should be prioritized for aerosol generating procedures Staff should wear gloves for contact with patients or their environment Isolation gowns should be prioritized for aerosol generating procedures, care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated and high-contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of HCP (e.g., dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use, wound care) Staff should remove PPE and perform hand hygiene when leaving the patient care area PPE should not be worn in the staff respite area

Refer to Strategies for Optimizing PPE Supply2 for additional guidance Component Hygiene Planning Considerations Adequate sinks for hand hygiene are available

Adequate numbers of toilets, including a separate toilet for staff are available

Adequate shower facilities are available

Based on the population being served, an appropriate supply of bedside commodes, urinals, and personal hygiene supplies (soap, toothpaste) should be available Examples ACS with individual patient rooms (e.g., hotel): each patient ideally should have a separate room with a separate bathroom

each patient ideally should have a separate room with a separate bathroom ACS with open floor plan: Minimum of 1 toilet for every 20 persons, and 1 accessible toilet for every 6 persons with disabilities. Approximate ratio of 1 shower for every 25 persons, or 1 shower for every 6 persons with disabilities

Guidance for Dental Settings,"Key Points Recognize dental settings have unique characteristics that warrant specific infection control considerations.

Prioritize the most critical dental services and provide care in a way that minimizes harm to patients from delaying care and harm to personnel and patients from potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Proactively communicate to both personnel and patients the need for them to stay at home if sick.

Know the steps to take if a patient with COVID-19 symptoms enters your facility.

Summary of Recent Changes Guidance has been rearranged for clarity.

Updated the definition of fever to either measured temperature ≥100.0°F or subjective fever to align with CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Healthcare Personnel During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.

In areas with moderate to substantial community transmission, during patient encounters with patients not suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, CDC recommends that dental healthcare personnel (DHCP): Wear eye protection in addition to their facemask to ensure the eyes, nose, and mouth are all protected from exposure to respiratory secretions during patient care encounters, including those where splashes and sprays are not anticipated. Use an N95 respirator or a respirator that offers an equivalent or higher level of protection during aerosol generating procedures.

Added language that protective eyewear (e.g., safety glasses, trauma glasses) with gaps between glasses and the face likely do not protect eyes from all splashes and sprays.

Included additional guidance on physical distancing and how to respond to SARS-CoV-2 exposures among DHCP and others.

Background

This interim guidance has been updated based on currently available information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the current situation in the United States. As dental healthcare facilities begin to restart elective procedures in accordance with guidance from local and state officials, there are precautions that should remain in place as a part of the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most recommendations in this updated guidance are not new (except as noted in the summary of changes above); they have been reorganized into the following sections:

Dental settings should balance the need to provide necessary services while minimizing risk to patients and dental healthcare personnel (DHCP). CDC has developed a framework for healthcare personnel and healthcare systems for delivery of non-emergent care during the COVID-19 pandemic. DHCP should regularly consult their state dental boards and state or local health departments for current local information for requirements specific to their jurisdictions, including recognizing the degree of community transmission and impact, and their region-specific recommendations.

Transmission: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is thought to spread primarily between people who are in close contact with one another (within 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely. However, COVID-19 is a new disease, and we are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes. The virus has been shown to persist in aerosols for hours, and on some surfaces for days under laboratory conditions. SARS-CoV-2 can be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.

Risk: The practice of dentistry involves the use of rotary dental and surgical instruments, such as handpieces or ultrasonic scalers and air-water syringes. These instruments create a visible spray that can contain particle droplets of water, saliva, blood, microorganisms, and other debris. Surgical masks protect mucous membranes of the mouth and nose from droplet spatter, but they do not provide complete protection against inhalation of infectious agents. There are currently no data available to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during dental practice.

Recommendations

1. Recommended infection prevention and control (IPC) practices for routine dental healthcare delivery during the pandemic

CDC recommends using additional infection prevention and control practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with standard practices recommended as a part of routine dental healthcare delivery to all patients. These practices are intended to apply to all patients, not just those with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (See Section 2 for additional practices that should be used when providing dental healthcare for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection). These additional practices for all patients include:

PPE Supply Optimization Strategies

Major distributors in the United States have reported shortages of PPE, especially surgical masks and respirators. The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. CDC has developed a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of PPE in healthcare settings when there is limited supply, and a burn rate calculator that provides information for healthcare facilities to plan and optimize the use of PPE for response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Optimization strategies are provided for gloves, gowns, facemasks, eye protection, and respirators.

These policies are only intended to remain in effect during times of shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. DHCP should review this guidance carefully, as it is based on a set of tiered recommendations. Strategies should be implemented sequentially. Decisions by facilities to move to contingency and crisis capacity strategies are based on the following assumptions:

Facilities understand their current PPE inventory and supply chain;

Facilities understand their PPE utilization rate;

Facilities are in communication with local healthcare coalitions and federal, state, and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) regarding identification of additional supplies;

Facilities have already implemented engineering and administrative control measures;

Facilities have provided DHCP with required education and training, including having them demonstrate competency with donning and doffing, with any PPE ensemble that is used to perform job responsibilities, such as provision of patient care.

For example, extended use of facemasks and respirators should only be undertaken when the facility is at contingency or crisis capacity and has reasonably implemented all applicable administrative and engineering controls. Such controls include selectively canceling elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which PPE is typically used by DHCP. Extended use of PPE is not intended to encourage dental facilities to practice at a normal patient volume during a PPE shortage, but only to be implemented in the short term when other controls have been exhausted. Once the supply of PPE has increased, facilities should return to conventional strategies.

Respirators that comply with international standards may be considered during times of known shortages. CDC has guidance entitled Factors to Consider When Planning to Purchase Respirators from Another Country which includes a webinar, and Assessments of International Respirators.

Hand Hygiene

Ensure DHCP practice strict adherence to hand hygiene, including:

Before and after all patient contact, contact with potentially infectious material, and before putting on and after removing personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves. Hand hygiene after removing PPE is particularly important to remove any pathogens that might have been transferred to bare hands during the removal process.

Use ABHR with at least 60% alcohol or wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are visibly soiled, use soap and water before returning to ABHR.

Dental healthcare facilities should ensure that hand hygiene supplies are readily available to all DHCP in every patient care location.

Equipment Considerations

After a period of non-use, dental equipment may require maintenance and/or repair. Review the manufacturer’s instructions for use (IFU) for office closure, period of non-use, and reopening for all equipment and devices. Some considerations include: Dental unit waterlines (DUWL): Test water quality to ensure it meets standards for safe drinking water as established by the Environmental Protection Agency (< 500 CFU/mL) prior to expanding dental care practices. Confer with the manufacturer regarding recommendations for need to shock DUWL of any devices and products that deliver water used for dental procedures. Continue standard maintenance and monitoring of DUWL according to the IFUs of the dental operatory unit and the DUWL treatment products. Autoclaves and instrument cleaning equipment Ensure that all routine cleaning and maintenance have been performed according to the schedule recommended per manufacturer’s IFU. Test sterilizers using a biological indicator with a matching control (i.e., biological indicator and control from same lot number) after a period of non-use prior to reopening per manufacturer’s IFU. Air compressor, vacuum and suction lines, radiography equipment, high-tech equipment, amalgam separators, and other dental equipment: Follow protocol for storage and recommended maintenance per manufacturer IFU.

For additional guidance on reopening buildings, see CDC’s Guidance for Reopening Buildings After Prolonged Shutdown or Reduced Operation.

Optimize the Use of Engineering Controls

CDC does not provide guidance on the decontamination of building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2. To date, CDC has not identified confirmatory evidence to demonstrate that viable virus is contaminating these systems. CDC provides the following recommendations for proper maintenance of ventilation systems and patient placement and volume strategies in dental settings.

Properly maintain ventilation systems.

Ventilation systems that provide air movement in a clean-to-less-clean flow direction reduce the distribution of contaminants and are better at protecting staff and patients. For example, in a dental facility with staff workstations in the corridor right outside the patient operatories, supply-air vents would deliver clean air into the corridor, and return-air vents in the rear of the less-clean patient operatories would pull the air out of the room. Thus, the clean air from the corridor flows past the staff workstations and into the patient operatories. Similarly, placing supply-air vents in the receptionist area and return-air vents in the waiting area pulls clean air from the reception area into the waiting area. Consult with facilities operation staff or an HVAC professional to Understand clinical air flow patterns and determine air changes per hour. Investigate increasing filtration efficiency to the highest level compatible with the HVAC system without significant deviation from designed airflow. Investigate the ability to safely increase the percentage of outdoor air supplied through the HVAC system (requires compatibility with equipment capacity and environmental conditions). Limit the use of demand-controlled ventilation (triggered by temperature setpoint and/or by occupancy controls) during occupied hours and when feasible, up to 2 hours post occupancy to assure that the ventilation rate does not automatically change. Run bathroom exhaust fans continuously during business hours. Consider the use of a portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) air filtration unit while the patient is undergoing, and immediately following, an aerosol generating procedure. Select a HEPA air filtration unit based on its Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR). The CADR is an established performance standard defined by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and reports the system’s cubic feet per minute (CFM) rating under as-used conditions. The higher the CADR, the faster the air cleaner will work to remove aerosols from the air. Rather than just relying on the building’s HVAC system capacity, use a HEPA air filtration unit to reduce aerosol concentrations in the room and increase the effectiveness of the turnover time.



Place the HEPA unit near the patient’s chair, but not behind the DHCP. Ensure the DHCP are not positioned between the unit and the patient’s mouth. Position the unit to ensure that it does not pull air into or past the breathing zone of the DHCP. Consider the use of upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) as an adjunct to higher ventilation and air cleaning rates.

Patient placement

Ideally, dental treatment should be provided in individual patient rooms, whenever possible.



For dental facilities with open floor plans, to prevent the spread of pathogens there should be: At least 6 feet of space between patient chairs. Physical barriers between patient chairs. Easy-to-clean floor-to-ceiling barriers will enhance effectiveness of portable HEPA air filtration systems (check to make sure that extending barriers to the ceiling will not interfere with fire sprinkler systems). Operatories should be oriented parallel to the direction of airflow if possible.



Where feasible, consider patient orientation carefully, placing the patient’s head near the return air vents, away from pedestrian corridors, and toward the rear wall when using vestibule-type office layouts.



Patient volume

Ensure to account for the time required to clean and disinfect operatories between patients when calculating your daily patient volume.



Environmental Infection Control

DHCP should ensure that environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly after each patient (however, it is not necessary that DHCP should attempt to sterilize a dental operatory between patients).

Clean and disinfect the room and equipment according to the Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health-Care Settings—2003 pdf icon .



Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures (e.g., using cleaners and water to clean surfaces before applying an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered, hospital-grade disinfectant to frequently touched surfaces or objects for appropriate contact times as indicated on the product’s label) are appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings, including those patient-care areas in which aerosol generating procedures are performed. Refer to List N external icon on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2.

applying an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered, hospital-grade disinfectant to frequently touched surfaces or objects for appropriate contact times as indicated on the product’s label) are appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings, including those patient-care areas in which aerosol generating procedures are performed. Alternative disinfection methods The efficacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light against SARS-CoV-2 virus is not known. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19. CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage. EPA only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identified on List N external icon against the virus that causes COVID-19.

Manage laundr y and medical waste in accordance with routine policies and procedures.

Sterilization and Disinfection of Patient-Care Items

Sterilization protocols do not vary for respiratory pathogens. DHCP should perform routine cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization protocols, and follow the recommendations for Sterilization and Disinfection of Patient-Care Items present in the Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health Care Settings – 2003 pdf icon .

. DHCP should follow the manufacturer’s instructions for times and temperatures recommended for sterilization of specific dental devices.

Education and Training

Provide DHCP with job- or task-specific education and training on preventing transmission of infectious agents, including refresher training. Training: Basic Expectations for Safe Care

Ensure that DHCP are educated, trained, and have practiced the appropriate use of PPE prior to caring for a patient, including attention to correct use of PPE and prevention of contamination of clothing, skin, and the environment during the process of removing such equipment. Using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Healthcare Respiratory Protection Resources Training



2. Recommended infection prevention and control (IPC) practices when providing dental healthcare for a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection

Surgical procedures that might pose higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission if the patient has COVID-19 include those that generate potentially infectious aerosols or involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher, such as the nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract (see Surgical FAQ).

If a patient arrives at your facility and is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, defer non-emergent dental treatment and take the following actions: If the patient is not already wearing a cloth face covering, give the patient a facemask to cover his or her nose and mouth. If the patient is not manifesting emergency warning signs for COVID-19, send the patient home, and instruct the patient to call his or her primary care provider. If the patient is manifesting emergency warning signs for COVID-19 (for example, has trouble breathing), refer the patient to a medical facility, or call 911 as needed and inform them that the patient may have COVID-19.

If emergency dental care is medically necessary for a patient who has, or is suspected of having, COVID-19, DHCP should follow CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Healthcare Personnel During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.

Dental treatment should be provided in an individual patient room with a closed door.

DHCP who enter the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should adhere to Standard Precautions and use a NIOSH-approved N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator (or facemask if a respirator is not available), gown, gloves, and eye protection. Protective eyewear (e.g., safety glasses, trauma glasses) with gaps between glasses and the face likely do not protect eyes from all splashes and sprays. Avoid aerosol generating procedures (e.g., use of dental handpieces, air/water syringe, ultrasonic scalers) if possible. If aerosol generating procedures must be performed Aerosol generating procedures should ideally take place in an airborne infection isolation room. DHCP in the room should wear an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator, such as disposable filtering facepiece respirator, PAPR, or elastomeric respirator, as well as eye protection (goggles or a face shield that covers the front and sides of the face), gloves, and a gown. The number of DHCP present during the procedure should be limited to only those essential for patient care and procedure support. Visitors should not be present for the procedure. Clean and disinfect procedure room surfaces promptly as described in the section on environmental infection control. Limit transport and movement of the patient outside of the room to medically essential purposes. Patients should wear a facemask or cloth face covering to contain secretions during transport. If patients cannot tolerate a facemask or cloth face covering or one is not available, they should use tissues to cover their mouth and nose while out of their room or care area. Consider scheduling the patient at the end of the day. Do not schedule any other patients at that time.

Protective eyewear (e.g., safety glasses, trauma glasses) with gaps between glasses and the face likely do not protect eyes from all splashes and sprays. To clean and disinfect the dental operatory after a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, DHCP should delay entry into the operatory until a sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. CDC’s Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities (2003) provides a table to calculate time required for airborne-contaminant removal by efficiency.

Definitions

Aerosol generating procedures – Procedures that may generate aerosols (i.e., particles of respirable size, <10 μm). Aerosols can remain airborne for extended periods and can be inhaled. Development of a comprehensive list of aerosol generating procedures for dental healthcare settings has not been possible, due to limitations in available data on which procedures may generate potentially infectious aerosols and the challenges in determining their potential for infectivity. There is neither expert consensus, nor sufficient supporting data, to create a definitive and comprehensive list of aerosol generating procedures for dental healthcare settings. Commonly used dental equipment known to create aerosols and airborne contamination include ultrasonic scaler, high-speed dental handpiece, air/water syringe, air polishing, and air abrasion.

Airborne infection isolation rooms – Single-patient rooms at negative pressure relative to the surrounding areas, and with a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (12 air changes per hour are recommended for new construction or renovation). Air from these rooms should be exhausted directly to the outside or be filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter directly before recirculation. Room doors should be kept closed except when entering or leaving the room, and entry and exit should be minimized. Facilities should monitor and document the proper negative-pressure function of these rooms.

Air changes per hour: the ratio of the volume of air flowing through a space in a certain period of time (the airflow rate) to the volume of that space (the room volume). This ratio is expressed as the number of air changes per hour.

Cloth face covering: Textile (cloth) covers that are intended for source control. They are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and it is uncertain whether cloth face coverings protect the wearer.

Community Transmission

No to minimal community transmission: Evidence of isolated cases or limited community transmission, case investigations underway; no evidence of exposure in large communal setting

Evidence of isolated cases or limited community transmission, case investigations underway; no evidence of exposure in large communal setting Minimal to moderate community transmission: Sustained transmission with high likelihood or confirmed exposure within communal settings and potential for rapid increase in cases

Sustained transmission with high likelihood or confirmed exposure within communal settings and potential for rapid increase in cases Substantial community transmission: Large scale community transmission, including communal settings (e.g., schools, workplaces)

Dental healthcare personnel (DHCP) – Refers to all paid and unpaid persons serving in dental healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials, including:

body substances

contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment

contaminated environmental surfaces

contaminated air

Facemaskpdf icon: Facemasks are PPE and are often referred to as surgical masks or procedure masks. Use facemasks according to product labeling and local, state, and federal requirements. FDA-cleared surgical masks are preferred in dental settings because they are designed to protect against splashes and sprays and are prioritized for use when such exposures are anticipated, including surgical procedures. Facemasks that are not regulated by FDA, such as some procedure masks, which are typically used for isolation purposes, may not provide protection against splashes and sprays.

Respirator: Is a personal protective device that is worn on the face, covers at least the nose and mouth, and is used to reduce the wearer’s risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles (including dust particles and infectious agents), gases, or vapors. Respirators are certified by CDC/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), including those intended for use in healthcare.

Respirator use must be in the context of a complete respiratory protection program in accordance with OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134external icon). DHCP should be medically cleared and fit tested if using respirators with tight-fitting facepieces (e.g., a NIOSH-approved N95 respirator) and trained in the proper use of respirators, safe removal and disposal, and medical contraindications to respirator use.",2/11/20 0:00,
Interim Additional Guidance for Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 in Outpatient Hemodialysis Facilities,"Summary of Changes Revisions made on October 21, 2020 Added links to the updated close contact definition.

Updated language to align with updated definition.

Below are changes to the guidance as of August 24, 2020:

Updated screening recommendations to include asking about exposure to others with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Added recommendation for universal use of eye protection (in addition to a medical facemask) during the care of all patients for healthcare personnel (HCP) working in facilities located in communities with moderate to substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Added language that protective eyewear (e.g., safety glasses, trauma glasses) with gaps between glasses and the face likely do not protect eyes from all splashes and sprays.

Added recommendations for how dialysis facilities should respond to newly identified patients and HCP with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Background

This information is provided to clarify SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), infection prevention and control (IPC) recommendations that are specific to outpatient hemodialysis facilities. This information complements, but does not replace, the general CDC IPC recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 available in Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Healthcare Personnel During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.

This guidance is based on the currently available information about SARS-CoV-2. This approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States. It is important to stay informed about SARS-CoV-2 to prevent introduction and minimize spread in your dialysis facility. Consult with public health authorities to understand if transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is occurring in your community.

As part of routine infection control, outpatient dialysis facilities should have established policies and practices to reduce the spread of contagious respiratory and other pathogens.

Implement Universal Source Control Measures

Source control refers to use of masks or medical facemasks to cover a person’s mouth and nose to prevent spread of respiratory secretions when they are breathing, talking, sneezing, or coughing. Because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, source control measures are recommended for everyone in a healthcare facility, even if they do not have symptoms of COVID-19. Patients and visitors should, ideally, wear their own mask (if tolerated) upon arrival to and throughout their stay in the facility. If they do not have a mask, they should be offered a medical facemask or mask, as supplies allow. Masks (including medical facemasks) should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Healthcare personnel (HCP) should wear a medical facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility, including in breakrooms or other spaces where they might encounter co-workers . When available, medical facemasks are preferred over masks for HCP as medical facemasks offer both source control and protection for the wearer against exposure to splashes and sprays of infectious material from others. Masks should NOT be worn instead of a respirator or medical facemask if more than source control is needed. Respirators with exhalation valves are not recommended for source control; If only a respirator with an exhalation valve is available and source control is needed, cover the exhalation valve with a medical facemask, or a mask that does not interfere with the respirator fit. ​



Screening, Triage, and Management of Individuals with Suspected or Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection

Implement processes for identifying and triaging individuals with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection before arrival. Remind HCP not to report to work when they are ill and to notify occupational health services if they have an unprotected exposure to someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection (either in the community or in the dialysis facility). Instruct patients to call ahead to report close contact in the past 14 days with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptoms of COVID-19 so the facility can be prepared for their arrival or triage them to a more appropriate setting (e.g., an acute care hospital). Because these exposed patients could go on to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, they should be cared for using all personal protective equipment (PPE) and precautions described for a patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, even if viral testing is negative during their 14-day quarantine period. This includes remaining at least 6 feet from other patients at all times in the facility. Unless the exposed patients are confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, they should not be cohorted with patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. If the exposed patients develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, full SARS-CoV-2 precautions should be followed until the patients meet criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions. Post signs at clinic entrances and strategic places around the facility with instructions for patients and visitors who have symptoms of COVID-19 or who have had close contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection to alert staff so appropriate precautions can be implemented. Provide patients, HCP, and visitors with instructions (in appropriate languages) about screening and triage procedures, including information about the importance of practicing source control, maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from all other persons whenever possible, and performing frequent hand hygiene. Instructions should include how to use masks and medical facemasks, how to use tissues to cover nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing (if a mask cannot be tolerated), how to dispose of tissues and contaminated items in waste receptacles, and how and when to perform hand hygiene. Position supplies close to dialysis chairs and nursing stations to promote adherence to hand and respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. These include tissues and no-touch receptacles for disposal of tissues and hand hygiene supplies (e.g., alcohol-based hand sanitizer). Make sure triage procedures are compliant with HIPAA guidance. While the process for screening and triage depends on facility layout and staffing, the general steps include: Placing a staff member near all entrances (outdoors if weather and facility layout permit), or in the waiting room area, to ensure everyone (patients, HCP, visitors) is screened for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or close contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection before they enter the treatment area and ensure they are practicing source control. Confirm absence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Fever is either measured temperature ≥100.0 ◦ F or subjective fever. Ask them if they have been advised to self-quarantine because of exposure to someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Properly manage anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 or who has been advised to self-quarantine: HCP should return home and should notify occupational health services to arrange for further evaluation. Visitors should be restricted from entering the facility. Patients should be managed as described under Patient Placement below.



Follow local regulations regarding reporting newly identified infections to public health authorities.



Placement of Patients with Suspected or Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection

Ideally facilities should have areas for all patients to wait separated by at least 6 feet. Medically stable patients might opt to wait in a personal vehicle or outside the healthcare facility where they can be contacted by mobile phone when it is their turn to be seen.

Patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or who have reported close contact should be brought back to an appropriate treatment area as soon as possible in order to minimize time in waiting areas. If they must wait, facilities should ensure the following: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection can be cohorted together (e.g., in the same waiting room); however, they should maintain at least 6 feet of separation from other patients at all times in the dialysis facility. Patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and patients who have had close contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection should also maintain at least 6 feet of separation from each other and from other patients at all times in the dialysis facility.

Separation should be maintained in the treatment area. Facilities should consider separating all patients by 6 feet during dialysis treatments, especially in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission.

Ideally, a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or who has reported close contact would be dialyzed in a separate room (if available) with the door closed. Hepatitis B isolation rooms should only be used for these patients if: 1) the patient is hepatitis B surface antigen positive or 2) the facility has no patients on the census with hepatitis B infection who would require treatment in the isolation room. If a separate room is not available, the patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or who reported close contact should be treated at a corner or end-of-row station, away from the main flow of traffic (if available). The patient should be separated by at least 6 feet from the nearest patient (in all directions).



If a hemodialysis facility is dialyzing more than one patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, consideration should be given to cohorting these patients and the HCP caring for them together in the same section of the unit and/or on the same shift (e.g., consider the last shift of the day). Only patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should be cohorted together. Patients who report close contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection and patients with symptoms for whom SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been confirmed, should not be cohorted with patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or with each other as their diagnosis is uncertain. These patients should be dialyzed at a station that is at least 6 feet from others in all directions.

Recommended PPE When Caring for a Patient with Suspected or Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection

HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or who have reported close contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection should use all of the following: N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator (or medical facemask if a respirator is not available) A mask (e.g., a cloth face covering) is NOT considered PPE and should not be worn by HCP when PPE is indicated. In times of shortage, special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella). Respirators should be worn by fit-tested personnel in the context of a respiratory protection program; Consider implementing a respiratory protection program that is compliant with the OSHA respiratory protection standard for employees if not already in place. The program should include medical evaluations, training, and fit testing. Eye protection (i.e., goggles, a face shield that covers the front and sides of the face). Protective eyewear (e.g., safety glasses, trauma glasses) with gaps between glasses and the face might not protect eyes from all splashes and sprays. Personal glasses and contact lenses are NOT adequate eye protection.



Gloves Isolation gown The isolation gown should be worn over or instead of the cover gown (e.g., laboratory coat, gown, or apron with incorporate sleeves) that is normally worn by hemodialysis personnel. If there are shortages of gowns, they should be prioritized for initiating and terminating dialysis treatment, manipulating access needles or catheters, helping the patient into and out of the station, and cleaning and disinfection of patient care equipment and the dialysis station. When gowns are removed, place the gown in a dedicated container for waste or linen before leaving the dialysis station. Disposable gowns should be discarded after use. Cloth gowns should be laundered after each use.



Recommended PPE When Caring for Patients Not Suspected to Have SARS-CoV-2 Infection

HCP working in facilities located in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission are more likely to encounter asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. If SARS-CoV-2 infection is not suspected in a patient presenting for care (based on symptom and exposure history), HCP should follow Standard Precautions and additional precautions routinely recommended for hemodialysis facilities (e.g., wearing a gown, gloves, and face shield during catheter connection) (and Transmission-Based Precautions if required based on the suspected diagnosis).

They should also:

Wear eye protection and medical facemask to ensure the eyes, nose, and mouth are all protected from exposure to respiratory secretions during patient care encounters. Wear an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator, instead of a medical facemask for aerosol generating procedures (refer to Which procedures are considered aerosol generating procedures in healthcare settings FAQ)

HCP working in facilities located in areas with minimal to no community transmission, should continue to adhere to Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions, including use of eye protection and/or an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator based on anticipated exposures and suspected or confirmed diagnoses. Universal use of a medical facemask for source control is recommended for HCP.

Cleaning & Disinfection

Current procedures for routine cleaning and disinfection of dialysis stations are appropriate for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, it is important to validate that the product used for surface disinfection is active against SARS-CoV-2external icon. Facilities should ensure they are following the manufacturer’s label instructions for proper use and dilution of the disinfectant. The manufacturer’s instructions are specific to the product and should be followed (e.g., this might not necessarily conform to a 1:100 or 1:10 dilution); some products do not require preparation or dilution and are sold as “ready to use.” The product you are currently using may need to be used at a different concentration or a different contact time.

Refer to List N external icon on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2. When using products from List N, ensure the products also have a bloodborne pathogen claim (e.g., hepatitis B, HIV). Note about List N: Products may be marketed and sold under different brand names, but if they have the same EPA registration number , they are the same product.

on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2.

Staff should be educated, trained, and have competency assessed for all cleaning and disinfection procedures in the facility. Ensure staff use appropriate PPE according to manufacturer’s recommendations when cleaning.

Include training on routine cleaning and disinfection of the dialysis station as well as any high touch surfaces that can often missed such as scale and waiting areas.

Important reminders from the Environmental Surface Disinfection in Dialysis Facilities: Notes for Clinical Managers pdf icon and Checklist: Dialysis Station Routine Disinfection pdf icon : Routine disinfection of surfaces at the station should occur with no patient present to reduce the opportunities for cross-contamination and to avoid exposing patients to disinfectant fumes. If visible blood or other soil is present, surfaces must be cleaned prior to disinfection.

and Checklist: Dialysis Station Routine Disinfection :

Ensure that routine cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or who report close contact to someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Any surfaces, supplies, or equipment such as dialysis machines located within 6 feet of symptomatic patients should be disinfected or discarded appropriately.

Disposable medical supplies brought to the dialysis station should be discarded.

All non-dedicated, non-disposable medical equipment used for patient care should be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies.

Follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and regulated medical waste.

If linens or disposable cover sheets are used on the dialysis chairs, follow standard procedures for containing and/or laundering used items.

Additional information about recommended practices for terminal cleaning of rooms and PPE to be worn by those performing the cleaning and disinfection is available in the Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control FAQs for COVID-19.

Response to Newly Identified Patients or HCP with SARS-CoV-2 Infection

Facilities should have a process to respond to patients or HCP with newly identified SARS-CoV-2 infection, including assessing risk to others in the facility who may have had close contact with infected individuals.

Individuals with COVID-19 symptoms are considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days before symptoms first appeared until they meet criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions (for patients) or to Return to Work (HCP).

If the infected individual did not have symptoms, collecting information about when they could have been exposed can help inform the estimated period when they were infectious.

If an exposure is identified : The individual can be considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days after the exposure until criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or Return to Work are met. If the date of exposure cannot be determined: For the purposes of contact tracing, it is reasonable to use a cutoff of 2 days before the specimen testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was collected as the starting point, continuing until the criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or Return to Work are met.



If the infected individual is a HCP:

If the infected individual is a patient:

Patients who were within 6 feet of the infected patient for a total of 15 minutes or more (close contact) should be considered potentially exposed, even if masks were worn. In general, exposed patients should be dialyzed separated from other patients by at least 6 feet and cared for by HCP using all recommended PPE for SARS-CoV-2 until 14 days after their last exposure.

If the exposed patient was wearing a medical facemask instead of a mask, a risk assessment (as described above) can be considered to determine if precautions are necessary. If they develop SARS-CoV-2 infection they should be cared for using all recommended PPE for SARS-CoV-2 until the patient meets criteria for discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions.

Perform a risk assessment and apply work restrictions for HCP who were exposed to the infected patient based on whether these HCP had prolonged, close contact and what PPE they were wearing. More detailed information is available in the Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Work Restrictions for Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure to COVID-19

what PPE they were wearing. More detailed information is available in the Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Work Restrictions for Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure to COVID-19 Exposed patients determined to be close contacts should be advised to self-quarantine at home for 14 days after their last contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection, other than when they need to leave their home for hemodialysis treatments or other necessary medical appointments.

Identifying outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the dialysis facility

Since patients or HCP can develop a SARS-CoV-2 infection due to exposure outside of the dialysis facility, identifying transmission within a dialysis facility can be challenging. People with SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemiologic links within the dialysis facility, and no other identified exposures suggest that transmission might have occurred within the dialysis facility. Any transmission within a dialysis facility should be considered an outbreak.

If an outbreak is suspected, facilities should consider using PPE recommended for care of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection for all patients in the facility pending further investigation and testing. Notify local public health authorities of suspected or confirmed outbreaks in the dialysis facility.

If facilities experience large numbers of newly infected HCP or patients over short periods of time (e.g., one week), universal PPE use and/or facility-wide testing might also be considered (especially in facilities located in areas with moderate or substantial transmission).

Mask: Textile (cloth) face coverings that are intended to keep the person wearing one from spreading respiratory secretions when talking, sneezing, or coughing. They are not PPE, and it is uncertain whether masks protect the wearer. Guidance on design, use, and maintenance of masks is available.

Use medical facemasks according to product labeling and local, state, and federal requirements. FDA-cleared surgical masks are designed to protect against splashes and sprays and are prioritized for use when such exposures are anticipated, including surgical procedures. Some medical facemasks that are not regulated by FDA, such as some procedure masks, which are typically used for isolation purposes, may not provide protection against splashes and sprays.

Preparing for COVID-19 in Nursing Homes,"Background

Given their congregate nature and resident population served (e.g., older adults often with underlying chronic medical conditions), nursing home populations are at high risk of being affected by respiratory pathogens like COVID-19 and other pathogens, including multidrug-resistant organisms (e.g., Carbapenemase-producing organisms, Candida auris ). As demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a strong infection prevention and control (IPC) program is critical to protect both residents and healthcare personnel (HCP).

Facilities should assign at least one individual with training in IPC to provide on-site management of their COVID-19 prevention and response activities because of the breadth of activities for which an IPC program is responsible, including developing IPC policies and procedures, performing infection surveillance, providing competency-based training of HCP, and auditing adherence to recommended IPC practices.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently issued Nursing Home Reopening Guidance for State and Local Officialspdf iconexternal icon that outlines criteria that could be used to determine when nursing homes could relax restrictions on visitation and group activities and when such restrictions should be reimplemented. Nursing homes should consider the current situation in their facility and community and refer to that guidance as well as direction from state and local officials when making decisions about relaxing restrictions. When relaxing any restrictions, nursing homes must remain vigilant for COVID-19 among residents and HCP in order to prevent spread and protect residents and HCP from severe infections, hospitalizations, and death.

This guidance has been updated and reorganized according to core IPC practices that should remain in place even as nursing homes resume normal practices, plus additional strategies depending on the stages described in the CMS Reopening Guidancepdf iconexternal icon or at the direction of state and local officials. This guidance is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and will be refined and updated as more information becomes available.

These recommendations supplement the CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings and are specific for nursing homes, including skilled nursing facilities.

Additional Key Resources:

Core Practices

These practices should remain in place even as nursing homes resume normal activities.

Assign One or More Individuals with Training in Infection Control to Provide On-Site Management of the IPC Program.

This should be a full-time role for at least one person in facilities that have more than 100 residents or that provide on-site ventilator or hemodialysis services. Smaller facilities should consider staffing the IPC program based on the resident population and facility service needs identified in the facility risk assessment.

CDC has created an online training course external icon that can be used to orient individuals to this role in nursing homes.

Report COVID-19 cases, facility staffing, and supply information to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Long-term Care Facility (LTCF) COVID-19 Module weekly.

CDC’s NHSN provides long-term care facilities with a customized system to track infections and prevention process measures in a systematic way. Nursing homes can report into the four pathways of the LTCF COVID-19 Module including: Resident impact and facility capacity Staff and personnel impact Supplies and personal protective equipment Ventilator capacity and supplies

Weekly data submission to NHSN will meet the CMS COVID-19 reporting requirements. pdf icon external icon

Educate Residents, Healthcare Personnel, and Visitors about COVID-19, Current Precautions Being Taken in the Facility, and Actions They Should Take to Protect Themselves.

Provide information about COVID-19 (including information about signs and symptoms) and strategies for managing stress and anxiety.

Regularly review CDC’s Infection Control Guidance for Healthcare Professionals about COVID-19 for current information and ensure staff and residents are updated when this guidance changes.

Educate and train HCP, including facility-based and consultant personnel (e.g., wound care, podiatry, barber) and volunteers who provide care or services in the facility. Including consultants is important, since they commonly provide care in multiple facilities where they can be exposed to and serve as a source of COVID-19. Reinforce sick leave policies, and remind HCP not to report to work when ill. Reinforce adherence to standard IPC measures including hand hygiene and selection and correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Have HCP demonstrate competency with putting on and removing PPE and monitor adherence by observing their resident care activities. CDC has created training modules for front-line staff that can be used to reinforce recommended practices for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens. Educate HCP about any new policies or procedures.

Educate residents and families on topics including information about COVID-19, actions the facility is taking to protect them and/or their loved ones, any visitor restrictions that are in place, and actions residents and families should take to protect themselves in the facility, emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene and source control.

Have a plan and mechanism to regularly communicate with residents, families and HCP, including if cases of COVID-19 are identified among residents or HCP.

Implement Source Control Measures.

HCP should wear a facemask at all times while they are in the facility. When available, facemasks are generally preferred over cloth face coverings for HCP as facemasks offer both source control and protection for the wearer against exposure to splashes and sprays of infectious material from others. Guidance on extended use and reuse of facemasks is available. Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn by HCP instead of a respirator or facemask if PPE is required.

Residents should wear a cloth face covering or facemask (if tolerated) whenever they leave their room, including for procedures outside the facility. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. In addition to the categories described above cloth face coverings should not be placed on children under 2.

Visitors, if permitted into the facility, should wear a cloth face covering while in the facility.

Have a Plan for Visitor Restrictions.

Send letters or emails pdf icon to families reminding them not to visit when ill or if they have a known exposure to someone with COVID-19.

to families reminding them not to visit when ill or if they have a known exposure to someone with COVID-19. Facilitate and encourage alternative methods for visitation pdf icon (e.g., video conferencing) and communication with the resident

Post signs at the entrances to the facility advising visitors to check-in with the front desk to be assessed for symptoms prior to entry. Screen visitors for fever (T≥100.0 o F), symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or known exposure to someone with COVID-19. Restrict anyone with fever, symptoms, or known exposure from entering the facility.

Ask visitors to inform the facility if they develop fever or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 within 14 days of visiting the facility.

Have a plan for when the facility will implement additional restrictions, ranging from limiting the number of visitors and allowing visitation only during select hours or in select locations to restricting all visitors, except for compassionate care reasons (see below).

Create a Plan for Testing Residents and Healthcare Personnel for SARS-CoV-2.

Testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in respiratory specimens can detect current infections (referred to here as viral testing or test) among residents and HCP in nursing homes.

The plan pdf icon external icon should align with state and federal requirements for testing residents and HCP for SARS-CoV-2 and address: Triggers for performing testing (e.g., a resident or HCP with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, response to a resident or HCP with COVID-19 in the facility, routine surveillance) Access to tests capable of detecting the virus (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) and an arrangement with laboratories to process tests Antibody test results should not be used to diagnose someone with an active SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used to inform IPC action. Process for and capacity to perform SARS-CoV-2 testing of all residents and HCP A procedure for addressing residents or HCP who decline or are unable to be tested (e.g., maintaining Transmission-Based Precautions until symptom-based criteria are met for a symptomatic resident who refuses testing)

should align with state and federal requirements for testing residents and HCP for SARS-CoV-2 and address: Additional information about testing of residents and HCP is available: CDC Strategy for COVID-19 Testing Nursing Homes. Considerations for Performing Facility-wide SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Nursing Homes



Evaluate and Manage Healthcare Personnel.

Implement sick leave policies that are non-punitive, flexible, and consistent with public health policies that support HCP to stay home when ill.

Create an inventory of all volunteers and personnel who provide care in the facility. Use that inventory to determine which personnel are non-essential and whose services can be delayed if such restrictions are necessary to prevent or control transmission.

As part of routine practice, ask HCP (including consultant personnel and ancillary staff such as environmental and dietary services) to regularly monitor themselves for fever and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Remind HCP to stay home when they are ill. If HCP develop fever (T≥100.0 o F) or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 while at work they should inform their supervisor and leave the workplace. Have a plan for how to respond to HCP with COVID-19 who worked while ill (e.g., identifying and performing a risk assessment for exposed residents and co-workers). HCP with suspected COVID-19 should be prioritized for testing.

Screen all HCP at the beginning of their shift for fever and symptoms of COVID-19. Actively take their temperature* and document absence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. If they are ill, have them keep their cloth face covering or facemask on and leave the workplace. *Fever is either measured temperature >100.0 o F or subjective fever. Note that fever may be intermittent or may not be present in some individuals, such as those who are elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs). Clinical judgement should be used to guide testing of individuals in such situations. HCP who work in multiple locations may pose higher risk and should be encouraged to tell facilities if they have had exposure to other facilities with recognized COVID-19 cases.

Develop (or review existing) plans to mitigate staffing shortages from illness or absenteeism. CDC has created guidance to assist facilities with mitigating staffing shortages. For guidance on when HCP with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may return to work, refer to Criteria for Return to Work for Healthcare Personnel with Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 (Interim Guidance)



Provide Supplies Necessary to Adhere to Recommended Infection Prevention and Control Practices.

Hand Hygiene Supplies: Put alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60-95% alcohol in every resident room (ideally both inside and outside of the room) and other resident care and common areas (e.g., outside dining hall, in therapy gym). Unless hands are visibly soiled, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is preferred over soap and water in most clinical situations. Make sure that sinks are well-stocked with soap and paper towels for handwashing.

Respiratory Hygiene and Cough Etiquette: Make tissues and trash cans available in common areas and resident rooms for respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and source control.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Perform and maintain an inventory of PPE in the facility. Identify health department or healthcare coalition external icon contacts for getting assistance during PPE shortages. The Supplies and Personal Protective Equipment pathway in the NHSN LTCF COVID-19 Module can be used to indicate critical PPE shortages (i.e., less than one week supply remaining despite use of PPE conservation strategies). Monitor daily PPE use to identify when supplies will run low; use the PPE burn rate calculator or other tools. Make necessary PPE available in areas where resident care is provided. Consider designating staff responsible for stewarding those supplies and monitoring and providing just-in-time feedback promoting appropriate use by staff. Facilities should have supplies of facemasks, respirators (if available and the facility has a respiratory protection program with trained, medically cleared, and fit-tested HCP), gowns, gloves, and eye protection (i.e., face shield or goggles). Position a trash can near the exit inside the resident room to make it easy for staff to discard PPE prior to exiting the room or before providing care for another resident in the same room. Implement strategies to optimize current PPE supply even before shortages occur , including bundling resident care and treatment activities to minimize entries into resident rooms. Additional strategies might include: Extended use of respirators, facemasks, and eye protection, which refers to the practice of wearing the same respirator or facemask and eye protection for the care of more than one resident (e.g., for an entire shift). Care must be taken to avoid touching the respirator, facemask, or eye protection . If this must occur (e.g., to adjust or reposition PPE), HCP should perform hand hygiene immediately after touching PPE to prevent contaminating themselves or others. Prioritizing gowns for activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated (including aerosol-generating procedures) and high-contact resident care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to hands and clothing of HCP. If extended use of gowns is implemented as part of crisis strategies, the same gown should not be worn when caring for different residents unless it is for the care of residents with confirmed COVID-19 who are cohorted in the same area of the facility and these residents are not known to have any co-infections (e.g., Clostridioides difficile) Implement a process for decontamination and reuse of PPE such as face shields and goggles. Facilities should continue to assess PPE supply and current situation to determine when a return to standard practices can be considered. Implement a respiratory protection program that is compliant with the OSHA respiratory protection standard for employees if not already in place. The program should include medical evaluations, training, and fit testing. Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection: Develop a schedule for regular cleaning and disinfection of shared equipment, frequently touched surfaces in resident rooms and common areas; Ensure EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectants are available to allow for frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces and shared resident care equipment. Use an EPA-registered disinfectant from List N external icon on the EPA website to disinfect surfaces that might be contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. Ensure HCP are appropriately trained on its use.



Identify Space in the Facility that Could be Dedicated to Monitor and Care for Residents with COVID-19.

Identify space in the facility that could be dedicated to care for residents with confirmed COVID-19. This could be a dedicated floor, unit, or wing in the facility or a group of rooms at the end of the unit that will be used to cohort residents with COVID-19. Identify HCP who will be assigned to work only on the COVID-19 care unit when it is in use.

Have a plan for how residents in the facility who develop COVID-19 will be handled (e.g., transfer to single room, implement use of Transmission-Based Precautions, prioritize for testing, transfer to COVID-19 unit if positive). Residents in the facility who develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 could be moved to a single room pending results of SARS-CoV-2 testing. They should not be placed in a room with a new admission nor should they be moved to the COVID-19 care unit unless they are confirmed to have COVID-19 by testing. While awaiting results of testing, HCP should wear an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if a respirator is not available), eye protection (i.e., goggles or a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face), gloves, and gown when caring for these residents. Cloth face coverings are not considered PPE and should only be worn by HCP for source control, not when PPE is indicated.

Have a plan for how roommates, other residents, and HCP who may have been exposed to an individual with COVID-19 will be handled (e.g., monitor closely, avoid placing unexposed residents into a shared space with them).

Additional information about cohorting residents and establishing a designated COVID-19 care unit is available in the Considerations for the Public Health Response to COVID-19 in Nursing Homes

Create a Plan for Managing New Admissions and Readmissions Whose COVID-19 Status is Unknown.

Depending on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, this might include placing the resident in a single-person room or in a separate observation area so the resident can be monitored for evidence of COVID-19. HCP should wear an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if a respirator is not available), eye protection (i.e., goggles or a face shield that covers the front and sides of the face), gloves, and gown when caring for these residents. Residents can be transferred out of the observation area to the main facility if they remain afebrile and without symptoms for 14 days after their admission. Testing at the end of this period can be considered to increase certainty that the resident is not infected.

Evaluate and Manage Residents with Symptoms of COVID-19.

Ask residents to report if they feel feverish or have symptoms consistent with COVID-19.

Actively monitor all residents upon admission and at least daily for fever (T≥100.0 o F) and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Ideally, include an assessment of oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry. If residents have fever or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, implement Transmission-Based Precautions as described below. Older adults with COVID-19 may not show common symptoms such as fever or respiratory symptoms. Less common symptoms can include new or worsening malaise, headache, or new dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell. Additionally, more than two temperatures >99.0 o F might also be a sign of fever in this population. Identification of these symptoms should prompt isolation and further evaluation for COVID-19.

F) and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Ideally, include an assessment of oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry. If residents have fever or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, implement Transmission-Based Precautions as described below. The health department should be notified about residents or HCP with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, residents with severe respiratory infection resulting in hospitalization or death, or ≥ 3 residents or HCP with new-onset respiratory symptoms within 72 hours of each other. Contact information for the healthcare-associated infections program in each state health department is available here: https://www.cdc.gov/hai/state-based/index.html Refer to CDC resources pdf icon for performing respiratory infection surveillance in long-term care facilities during an outbreak.

Information about the clinical presentation and course of patients with COVID-19 is described in the Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). CDC has also developed guidance on Evaluating and Reporting Persons Under Investigation (PUI).

If COVID-19 is suspected, based on evaluation of the resident or prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, follow the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. This guidance should be implemented immediately once COVID-19 is suspected Residents with suspected COVID-19 should be prioritized for testing. Residents with known or suspected COVID-19 do not need to be placed into an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) but should ideally be placed in a private room with their own bathroom. Residents with COVID-19 should, ideally, be cared for in a dedicated unit or section of the facility with dedicated HCP (see section on Dedicating Space). As roommates of residents with COVID-19 might already be exposed, it is generally not recommended to place them with another roommate until 14 days after their exposure, assuming they have not developed symptoms or had a positive test. Residents with known or suspected COVID-19 should be cared for using all recommended PPE, which includes use of an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if a respirator is not available), eye protection (i.e., goggles or a face shield that covers the front and sides of the face), gloves, and gown. Cloth face coverings are not considered PPE and should not be worn when PPE is indicated. Increase monitoring of ill residents, including assessment of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry, and respiratory exam, to at least 3 times daily to identify and quickly manage serious infection. Consider increasing monitoring of asymptomatic residents from daily to every shift to more rapidly detect any with new symptoms. If a resident requires a higher level of care or the facility cannot fully implement all recommended infection control precautions, the resident should be transferred to another facility that is capable of implementation . Transport personnel and the receiving facility should be notified about the suspected diagnosis prior to transfer . While awaiting transfer, residents should be separated from others (e.g., in a private room with the door closed) and should wear a cloth face covering or facemask (if tolerated) when others are in the room and during transport. All recommended PPE should be used by healthcare personnel when coming in contact with the resident. Because of the higher risk of unrecognized infection among residents, universal use of all recommended PPE for the care of all residents on the affected unit (or facility-wide depending on the situation) is recommended when even a single case among residents or HCP is newly identified in the facility; this could also be considered when there is sustained transmission in the community. The health department can assist with decisions about testing of asymptomatic residents. For decisions on removing residents who have had COVID-19 from Transmission-Based Precautions refer to the Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19

follow the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.

Additional Strategies Depending on the Facility’s Reopening Status

These strategies will depend on the stages described in the CMS Reopening Guidance or the direction of state and local officials.

Implement Social Distancing Measures

Implement aggressive social distancing measures (remaining at least 6 feet apart from others): Cancel communal dining and group activities, such as internal and external activities. Remind residents to practice social distancing, wear a cloth face covering (if tolerated), and perform hand hygiene. Remind HCP to practice social distancing and wear a facemask (for source control) when in break rooms or common areas.

Considerations when restrictions are being relaxed include: Allowing communal dining and group activities for residents without COVID-19, including those who have fully recovered while maintaining social distancing, source control measures, and limiting the numbers of residents who participate. Allowing for safe, socially distanced outdoor excursions for residents without COVID-19, including those who have fully recovered. Planning for such excursions should address: Use of cloth face covering for residents and facemask by staff (for source control) while they are outside Potential need for additional PPE by staff accompanying residents Rotating schedule to ensure all residents will have an opportunity if desired, but that does not fully disrupt other resident care activities by staff Defining times for outdoor activities so families could plan around the opportunity to see their loved ones



Implement Visitor Restrictions

Restrict all visitation to their facilities except for certain compassionate care reasons, such as end-of-life situations. Send letters or emails pdf icon to families advising them that no visitors will be allowed in the facility except for certain compassionate care situations, such as end of life situations. Use of alternative methods for visitation (e.g., video conferencing) should be facilitated by the facility.



Post signs at the entrances to the facility advising that no visitors may enter the facility. Decisions about visitation for compassionate care situations should be made on a case-by-case basis, which should include careful screening of the visitor for fever or symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Those with symptoms should not be permitted to enter the facility. Any visitors that are permitted must wear a cloth face covering while in the building and restrict their visit to the resident’s room or other location designated by the facility. They should also be reminded to frequently perform hand hygiene.



Considerations for visitation when restrictions are being relaxed include:

Permit visitation only during select hours and limit the number of visitors per resident (e.g., no more than 2 visitors at one time). Schedule visitation in advance to enable continued social distancing. Restrict visitation to the resident’s room or another designated location at the facility (e.g., outside).



Healthcare Personnel Monitoring and Restrictions:

Restrict non-essential healthcare personnel, such as those providing elective consultations, personnel providing non-essential services (e.g., barber, hair stylist), and volunteers from entering the building. Consider implementing telehealth to offer remote access to care activities.

Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Tool for Nursing Homes Preparing for COVID-19,"CDC’s COVID-19 Infection Control Assessment and Response (ICAR) tool was developed to help nursing homes prepare for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities can take steps to assess and improve their preparedness for responding to COVID-19. This ICAR tool should be used as one tool to develop a comprehensive COVID-19 response plan. This tool may also contain content relevant for assisted living facilities.

Health departments can use this tool to assess infection prevention practices and guide quality improvement activities (e.g., by addressing identified gaps). This tool may be used for remote (e.g., by telephone or video chat) or onsite assessment. This tool may also be used by healthcare facilities to conduct internal quality improvement audits.

Items assessed in the ICAR support the key strategies of:

Keeping COVID-19 out of the facility

Identifying infections as early as possible

Preventing spread of COVID-19 in the facility

Assessing and optimizing personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies

Identifying and managing severe illness in residents with COVID-19

Guidance for Pharmacies,"Summary of Recent Changes Below are changes to the guidance as of May 28, 2020: Provide clinical services according to the Framework for Healthcare Systems Providing Non-COVID-19 Clinical Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic, which includes considerations for delivering non-COVID-19 care by the degree of community transmission and potential for patient harm if care is deferred.

This guidance applies to all pharmacy staff to minimize their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the risk for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a vital part of the healthcare system, pharmacies play an important role in providing medicines, therapeutics, vaccines, and critical health services to the public. Ensuring continuous function of pharmacies during the COVID-19 pandemic is important. During the pandemic, pharmacy staff can minimize their risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 and reduce the risk for patients by using the principles of infection prevention and control and social distancing.

Implement universal use of face coverings

Individuals without coronavirus symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.

Everyone entering the pharmacy should wear a face covering for source control (i.e., to protect other people in case the person is infected), regardless of symptoms. CDC recommends persons entering public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain wear a cloth face covering , especially in areas of substantial community-based transmission. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

in areas of substantial community-based transmission. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians should always wear a facemask while they are in the pharmacy for source control.

Medical or surgical facemasks are generally preferred over cloth face coverings for healthcare professionals (HCP) for source control. If there are shortages of facemasks, facemasks should be prioritized for HCP who need them for PPE. Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn instead of a respirator or facemask if more than source control is required.

Advise staff who are sick to stay home

Make sure that pharmacy staff who have fever or symptoms that may be due to COVID-19 stay home and away from the workplace until they have recovered. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of and understand these policies.

Filling prescriptions

Although the actual process of preparing medications for dispensing is not a direct patient care activity, the other components of medication dispensing such as prescription intake, patient counseling, or patient education should be conducted in ways that maintain social distancing and minimize the risk of exposure for pharmacy staff and patients. In addition to following workplace guidance, pharmacy staff should:

Provide hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol on counters for use by patients and have sufficient and easy access to soap and water or hand sanitizer for staff.

Encourage all prescribers to submit prescription orders via telephone or electronically. The pharmacy should develop procedures to avoid handling paper prescriptions, in accordance with appropriate state laws, regulations, or executive orders.

After a prescription has been prepared, the packaged medication can be placed on a counter for the patient to retrieve, instead of being directly handed to the patient. Other strategies to limit direct contact with patients include: Avoid handling insurance or benefit cards. Instead, have the patient take a picture of the card for processing or read aloud the information that is needed (in a private location so other patients cannot hear). Avoid touching objects that have been handled by patients. If transfer of items must occur, pharmacy staff should wash their hands afterwards with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. They should always avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.

Encourage patients, especially those at increased risk of severe illness, to use alternate methods to pick-up medication. To decrease risk of exposure, patients who have an increased risk for severe illness due to COVID-19 may consider using: Home delivery of medications Curbside pickup Drive-through services Having someone else who is not at higher risk of severe illness pick up medications for them



Use strategies to minimize close contact between pharmacy staff and patients and between patients:

Use engineering controls where the patient and pharmacy staff interact, such as the pharmacy counter, to minimize close contact: Minimize physical contact with patients and between patients. Maintain social distancing (6 feet between individuals) for people entering the pharmacy as much as possible. Use signage/barriers and floor markers to instruct waiting patient s to remain 6 feet back from the counter, from other patient interfaces, and from other patients and pharmacy staff. To shield against droplets from coughs or sneezes, install a section of clear plastic at the patient contact area to provide barrier protection (e.g., plexiglass type material or clear plastic sheet). Configure with a pass-through opening at the bottom of the barrier for people to speak through or to provide pharmacy items. For hard non-porous surfaces, clean with detergent or soap and water if the surfaces are visibly dirty prior to disinfectant application. Frequently clean and disinfect all patient service counters and patient contact areas. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces such as workstations, keyboards, telephones, and doorknobs. Use EPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products for Use Against Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 external icon , the virus that causes COVID-19. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for concentration, application method, and contact time for all cleaning and disinfecting products. Discontinue the use of magazines and other shared items in pharmacy waiting areas. Ensure that the waiting area is cleaned regularly. Promote the use of self-serve checkout registers and clean and disinfect them frequently. Encourage the use of and have hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes available at register locations for use by patients.

where the patient and pharmacy staff interact, such as the pharmacy counter, to minimize close contact: Use administrative controls — such as protocols or changes to work practices, policies, or procedures — to keep staff and patients separated: Promote social distancing by diverting as many patients as possible to drive-through windows, curbside pick-up, or home delivery, where feasible. Large, outdoor signage asking pharmacy patients to use the drive-through window or call for curbside pick-up can be useful. Include text or automated telephone messages that specifically ask sick patients to stay home and request home delivery or send a well family member or friend to pick up their medicine. Limit the number of patients in the pharmacy at any given time to prevent crowding at the pharmacy counter or checkout areas. Pharmacists who are providing patients with chronic disease management services, medication management services, and other services that do not require face-to-face encounters should make every effort to use telephone, telehealth, or tele-pharmacy strategies. Close self-serve blood pressure units.

— such as protocols or changes to work practices, policies, or procedures — to keep staff and patients separated:

Reduce risk during COVID-19 testing and other close-contact pharmacy care services

Pharmacies that are participating in public health testing for COVID-19 should communicate with local and state public health staff to determine how to operationalize and prioritize client testing. State and local health departments will inform pharmacies about procedures to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. Some pharmacies are including self-collection options.

In the “CDC Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings,” there is guidance for collecting respiratory specimens.

Pharmacy staff conducting COVID-19 testing and other close-contact patient care procedures that will likely elicit coughs or sneezes (e.g., influenza and strep testing) should be provided with appropriate PPE. Staff who use respirators must be familiar with proper use and follow a complete respiratory protection program that complies with OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). Staff should receive training on the appropriate donning and doffing of PPE. Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn by staff instead of a respirator or facemask if more than source control is required.

Provide adult vaccinations based on local conditions

Evaluate provision of routine clinical preventive services, including adult vaccinations, that require face-to-face encounters. Based on local conditions, evaluate the risk of an in-person encounter versus the benefit using the Framework for Healthcare Systems Providing Non-COVID-19 Clinical Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Adult vaccination should be considered if the service can be delivered during a visit with no additional risk to the patient or the health care provider.

Consideration should be given to prioritizing older adults or adults with underlying conditions for vaccination due to their increased risk of disease and complications if vaccination is deferred.

Pharmacies should develop a strategy for screening patients for fever and symptoms of COVID-19 prior to providing vaccinations.

Health care providers should follow standard precautions and adhere to additional PPE recommendations, including use of a facemask at all times while in the facility. Use of eye protection is recommended in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission. For areas with minimal to no community transmission, eye protection is considered optional, unless otherwise indicated as part of standard precautions.

Hand hygiene should be performed before and after vaccine administration. If gloves are worn, they should be changed and hand hygiene should be performed between patients.",2/11/20 0:00,
COVID-19: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,"Personal protective equipment (PPE) is used every day by healthcare personnel (HCP) to protect themselves, patients, and others when providing care. PPE helps protect HCP from many hazards encountered in healthcare facilities.

The greatly increased need for PPE caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has caused PPE shortages, posing a tremendous challenge to the U.S. healthcare system. Healthcare facilities are having difficulty accessing the needed PPE and are having to identify alternate ways to provide patient care.

Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden increase in patient volume that would severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of PPE during the COVID-19 response. To help healthcare facilities plan and optimize the use of PPE in response to COVID-19, CDC has developed a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve PPE supplies along the continuum of care.",2/11/20 0:00,
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator,"Mobile app version now available The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator is now available as an app. Facilities can use the NIOSH PPE Tracker app to calculate their average PPE consumption rate or “burn rate.” The app estimates how many days a PPE supply will last given current inventory levels and PPE burn rate. The app is available for both iOSexternal icon and Androidexternal icon devices. Visit the NIOSH PPE Tracker app page to download this free tool.

The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator excel icon[3 sheets] is a spreadsheet-based model that will help healthcare facilities plan and optimize the use of PPE for response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Non-healthcare facilities such as correctional facilities may also find this tool useful.

To use the calculator, enter the number of full boxes of each type of PPE in stock (gowns, gloves, surgical masks, respirators, and face shields, for example) and the total number of patients at your facility. The tool will calculate the average consumption rate, also referred to as a “burn rate,” for each type of PPE entered in the spreadsheet. This information can then be used to estimate how long the remaining supply of PPE will last, based on the average consumption rate. Using the calculator can help facilities make order projections for future needs.

Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: COVID-19,"Audience: These considerations are intended for use by federal, state, and local public health officials, respiratory protection program managers, leaders in occupational health services and infection prevention and control programs, and other leaders in healthcare settings who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing pathogen transmission in healthcare settings.

Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called “N95 respirators”) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness plans. The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.

Controlling exposures to occupational hazards is a fundamental way to protect personnel. Conventionally, a hierarchy has been used to achieve feasible and effective controls. Multiple control strategies can be implemented concurrently and or sequentially. This hierarchy can be represented as follows:

Elimination

Substitution

Engineering controls

Administrative controls

Personal protective equipment (PPE)

To prevent infectious disease transmission, elimination (physically removing the hazard) and substitution (replacing the hazard) are not typically options for healthcare settings. However, exposures to transmissible respiratory pathogens in healthcare facilities can often be reduced or possibly avoided through engineering and administrative controls and PPE. Prompt detection and effective triage and isolation of potentially infectious patients are essential to prevent unnecessary exposures among patients, healthcare personnel (HCP), and visitors at the facility.

N95 respirators are the PPE most often used to control exposures to infections transmitted via the airborne route, though their effectiveness is highly dependent upon proper fit and use. N95 respirators are intended to be used once and then properly disposed of and replaced with a new N95 respirator. The optimal way to prevent airborne transmission is to use a combination of interventions from across the hierarchy of controls, not just PPE alone. Applying a combination of controls can provide an additional degree of protection, even if one intervention fails or is not available.

Respirators, when required to protect HCP from airborne contaminants such as some infectious agents, must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that meets the requirements of OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standardexternal icon. The program should include medical evaluations, training, and fit testing.

Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden increase in patient volume that would severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 response. To help healthcare facilities plan and optimize the use of respiratory protection in response to COVID-19, CDC has developed a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve N95 respirator supplies along the continuum of care.1

Conventional capacity: measures consisting of engineering, administrative, and PPE controls should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings.

measures consisting of engineering, administrative, and PPE controls should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings. Contingency capacity: measures that may be used temporarily during periods of expected N95 respirator shortages. Contingency capacity strategies should only be implemented after considering and implementing conventional capacity strategies. While current supply may meet the facility’s current or anticipated utilization rate, there may be uncertainty if future supply will be adequate and therefore, contingency capacity strategies may be needed.

measures that may be used temporarily during periods of expected N95 respirator shortages. Contingency capacity strategies should only be implemented after considering and implementing conventional capacity strategies. While current supply may meet the facility’s current or anticipated utilization rate, there may be uncertainty if future supply will be adequate and therefore, contingency capacity strategies may be needed. Crisis capacity: strategies that are not commensurate with U.S. standards of care but may need to be considered during periods of known N95 respirator shortages. Crisis capacity strategies should only be implemented after considering and implementing conventional and contingency capacity strategies. Facilities can consider crisis capacity when the supply is not able to meet the facility’s current or anticipated utilization rate.

CDC’s optimization strategies for N95 respirator supply offer a continuum of options for use when PPE supplies are stressed, running low, or exhausted. Contingency and then crisis capacity measures augment conventional capacity measures and are meant to be considered and implemented sequentially. As N95 respirator availability returns to normal, healthcare facilities should promptly resume conventional practices.",2/11/20 0:00,
Summary for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during Shortages​,"Limit the number of patients going to hospitals or outpatient settings by screening patients for acute respiratory illness prior to non-urgent care or elective visits

Exclude all HCP not directly involved in patient care (e.g., dietary, housekeeping employees)

Reduce face-to-face HCP encounters with patients (e.g., bundling activities, use of video monitoring)

Exclude visitors to patients with known or suspected COVID-19

Implement source control: Identify and assess patients who may be ill with or who may have been exposed to a patient with known COVID-19 and recommend they use facemasks until they can be placed in an AIIR or private room.

Cohort patients: Group together patients who are infected with the same organism to confine their care to one area

Cohort HCP: Assign designated teams of HCP to provide care for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19

Use telemedicine to screen and manage patients using technologies and referral networks to reduce the influx of patients to healthcare facilities

Train HCP on indications for use of N95 respirators

Train HCP on use of N95 respirators (i.e., proper use, fit, donning and doffing, etc.)

Implement just-in-time fit testing: Plan for larger scale evaluation, training, and fit testing of employees when necessary during a pandemic

Limit respirators during training: Determine which HCP do and do not need to be in a respiratory protection program and, when possible, allow limited re-use of respirators by individual HCP for training and then fit testing",2/11/20 0:00,
COVID-19 Decontamination and Reuse of Filtering Facepiece Respirators,"When should limited reuse be implemented?

Limited FFR reuse is just one of several strategies available for addressing an N95 FFR crisis capacity situation when there is a known shortage of devices after conventional and contingency capacity strategies have been implemented. It should only be considered during a crisis capacity situation during a declared public health emergency. When an N95 FFR crisis situation no longer exists, limited FFR reuse should not be utilized.

Before deciding to implement FFR reuse, facilities should explore opportunities to switch to respirators that are designed to be decontaminated and reused (e.g., elastomeric respirators or powered air-purifying respirators) to reduce demand for FFRs and the need for crisis capacity strategies.

Limitations for Limited FFR reuse

Decrease in N95 FFR fit and filtration performance

NIOSH-certified N95 FFRs are designed to filter 95% of particles when appropriately fitted to the wearer’s face. This means that an N95 that is not properly fitted to the face will likely give the wearer less protection. N95 FFRs are designed to be single-use devices but may be used multiple times under crisis capacity strategies. N95 FFR performance will decrease as the number of hours and number of donnings and doffings increase.

The number of times that an FFR can be reused will likely be limited by its fit because the tethering straps can become weaker or stretched after each donning. Each time an N95 FFR is donned or doffed, the integrity of the straps may be impacted. Repeated donning and doffing will result in the straps no longer being able to generate enough force to create a tight seal with the face. The resulting poor seal will allow unfiltered air to enter the N95 FFR and into the wearer’s breathing zone.

CDC recommends limiting the number of donnings for an N95 FFR to no more than five per device. It may be possible to don some models of FFRs more than five times [2]. One study reported that fit performance decreased over multiple, consecutive donnings and fit varied among the different models of FFRs examined [3]. If manufacturer guidance on how many times a particular FFR can be donned is not available, the CDC recommends limiting the number of uses to no more than five per device based on published data on changes in FFR fit from a limited number of FFR models over multiple donnings.

A recent observational study conducted in a hospital emergency room during the COVID-19 pandemic found that extended use and reuse of N95 FFRs as measured by the total hours and shifts the mask was worn and the number of donnings and doffings was associated with an increase in the fit failure of the respirators. This study also showed that it may be possible to don some models of FFRs more than five times [2]. Fit performance during limited reuse should be monitored by the respiratory protection program manager or appropriate safety personnel. Information about how to assess N95 FFR fit during limited reuse can be found below. More information on limited FFR reuse can be found here.

When practicing limited reuse (a crisis capacity strategy), under what conditions should I discard my filtering facepiece respirator (FFR)?

Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are single-use, disposable respirators that are normally discarded after each use. However, due to limited supplies of N95 FFRs during the COVID-19 pandemic, reuse of FFRs may become necessary. OSHA has outlined temporary enforcement discretion to permit the reuse of FFRs under specific circumstances in its memorandum, Enforcement Guidance for Respiratory Protection and the N95 Shortage Due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemicexternal icon, issued on April 3, 2020. Employers should refer to this OSHA memorandum to identify the specific circumstances.

The number of times that an FFR can be reused is limited by:

Fit

Filtration performance

Contamination and soiling

Damage

FFRs visibly contaminated with blood, respiratory or nasal secretions, or other bodily fluids should be discarded and not reused. FFRs that are damaged (e.g., broken straps, broken nose piece), malformed, or are unable to pass a fit check should also be discarded and not reused.

COVID-19: International Respirator Purchase,"This webinar discusses key factors to help buyers make informed procurement decisions when making a respirator purchase. The information will help to maximize the likelihood of obtaining safe and effective products that will keep workers safe.

When a respirator has been approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the user can be confident that the device will provide the expected level of protection, as long as it fits properly and is worn correctly. But when there is a shortage of NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), as we are experiencing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, other reliable options must be found. When possible, NIOSH recommends the use of NIOSH-approved reusable elastomeric respirators and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) as alternatives to FFRs.

When a facility still needs additional FFRs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have determined that other options may be appropriate to protect workers during the pandemic. One of these options is to purchase respirators that meet the regulatory requirements of the countries listed in the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorizationexternal icon (EUA)*. However, due to the current demand, buyers should be aware that an unprecedented number of products on the market do not perform as advertised. The three most common “pitfall” scenarios include:

Documents are altered so FFR models appear to comply with a particular standard, but they do not. Certification marks are counterfeit. Manufacturers’ names, logos, and model numbers are counterfeit.

Key Factors

The key factors described below should assist potential purchasers of international respirators in making informed procurement and distribution decisions to keep their workers safe. Due diligence should be done to apply all factors to maximize the possibility of obtaining safe and effective products.

Potential purchasers of international respirators should evaluate the device they plan to purchase, the manufacturer, any third-party intermediary (if applicable), and the contract terms before making purchasing decisions.

Introduction

NIOSH-approved respirators are available in many types, models, and sizes from many manufacturers for a wide variety of uses in many occupational settings. The most common types of respirators in healthcare are N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), surgical N95 FFRs, and PAPRs.

Of these three options, many healthcare practitioners are the least familiar with PAPRs. A PAPR is an air-purifying respirator that uses a blower to force air through filter cartridges or canisters and into the breathing zone of the wearer. This process creates an air flow inside either a tight-fitting facepiece or loose-fitting hood or helmet, providing a higher assigned protection factor (APF) than the reusable elastomeric non-powered air-purifying half facepiece (half mask) or N95 FFRs. A PAPR can be used for protection during healthcare procedures in which HCP are exposed to greater risks of aerosolized pathogens causing acute respiratory infections.

A PAPR may have a tight-fitting half or full facepiece or a loose-fitting facepiece, hood, or helmet. It has an OSHA APF of at least 25 for loose-fitting hoods and helmets, 50 for tight-fitting half masks, and 1,000 for full facepiece types and some loose-fitting hoods and helmets where the manufacturer’s testing has demonstrated an APF of 1,000.

CDC has published recommendations for HCP respiratory protection and of commonly used NIOSH-approved, FDA-cleared, single-use filtering facepiece N95 surgical respirators.1 Properly fitted FFR and half facepiece reusable elastomeric respirators are expected to reduce exposures to one-tenth of the concentration that is in the air, based on OSHA’s APF of 10 for these respirator types. All PAPR APFs exceed the APF of 10 for N95 FFR or elastomeric half facepiece respirators.2

PAPRs reduce the aerosol concentration inhaled by the wearer to at least 1/25th of that in the air, compared to a 1/10th reduction for FFRs and elastomeric half facepiece air-purifying respirators. OSHA assigns an APF of 1,000 to some PAPRs with hoods or helmets. However, employers must have evidence provided by the respirator manufacturer that testing of these respirators demonstrates performance at a level of protection of 1,000 to receive an APF of 1,000. Absent such evidence, PAPRs with loose-fitting helmets or hoods have an APF of 25. When used properly, PAPRs provide increased protection and decrease the likelihood of infection transmission to the wearer as compared to FFRs and half face reusable elastomeric respirators.

A variety of NIOSH-approved PAPR designs are available. Examples include those with tight-fitting facepieces and loose-fitting hoods or helmets, blower styles, battery types (e.g., Lithium ion, Nickel-Metal hydride, Nickel Cadmium) or over-the-counter disposable batteries, and high efficiency (HE) filters or filter cartridges. HE filters are 99.97% efficient against 0.3 micron particles. A PAPR may have adjustable air flow rates for added comfort and a range of cartridge protections some of which are solely for particulates (HE filters) and others which also protect against chemical gases and vapors that can be used to help protect against hazards associated with the handling of certain hazardous drugs and cleaning/disinfecting operations. The substantial PAPR product diversity provides flexibility to customize protection needed in a healthcare setting.

Loose-fitting NIOSH-approved PAPRs have several advantages over tight-fitting non-powered approved air-purifying respirators, including3:

A fit test is not required for PAPRs with loose-fitting headgear such as hoods and helmets.

PAPRs with loose-fitting headgear can be worn with a limited amount of facial hair.

Some models offer cartridges for particulate and/or gas/vapor protection.

Hooded PAPRs and PAPRs with helmets may offer limited to significant splash protection for the face and eyes.

PAPR systems have assigned protection factors (APF) of at least 25 (and up to 1,000 in some cases, as described above).

Some PAPRs have disposable, loose-fitting headgear and patients can see the face of the HCP, providing for better interpersonal communication.

Most PAPR components can be cleaned, disinfected, re-used, and shared.

PAPRs use only HE filters, which have a greater filtration efficiency against the smallest pathogen particles compared to N95 FFRs.

A PAPR may be less taxing from a physiological/breathing resistance perspective than other respirators.

The facility should assess the limitations and factors associated with using PAPRs when considering their use in healthcare settings, including:

A PAPR may interfere with the HCP’s visual field because of the limited downward vertical field of view.

The HCP’s ability to hear may be reduced because of the blower noise, and noise induced by the movement of a loose head covering.

The HCP’s ability to use of a stethoscope may be limited.

PAPR batteries must be recharged or replaced.

PAPRs require a significant amount of storage space in between shifts.

The facility must train HCP’s or other staff to maintain and properly disinfect and clean the PAPR.

NOTE: PAPR HE filters used in industry are generally re-used until they are soiled, damaged, or reduce PAPR air flow below specified levels. Caution should be used when using the filter for a live virus, and a practical replacement cycle should be implemented until more is known.

Conventional Capacity Strategies

OSHA-Compliant Respiratory Protection Program Requirements

When respirators, including PAPRs, are used to reduce inhalation exposures, OSHA requires a written respiratory protection program in compliance with OSHA 29CFR1910.134, and the respirators must be NIOSH-approved.4 To be considered NIOSH-approved, the PAPR assembly cannot be modified from its approved configuration, and only those replacement parts specified and provided by the manufacturer must be used. The manufacturer’s PAPR instructions are specific to a respirator model’s materials and specifications. Instructions are generally provided with the PAPR facepiece, blower, and battery packaging. All instructions must be carefully followed.

OSHA also permits employers to use the cleaning recommendations provided by the manufacturer of the respirator, provided such procedures are as effective as those listed in Appendix B- 2, meaning that the respirator is properly cleaned and disinfected in a manner that prevents damage to the respirator and does not cause harm (e.g., skin irritation) to the user.5

PAPRs may be used in healthcare for a variety of applications. Because they provide higher APFs than N95 FFRs and reusable elastomeric half facepiece respirators, PAPRs are suitable for use when aerosol-generating procedures are performed, by hospital first receivers, or when the respirator user is not able to wear a tight-fitting respirator. For effective use, PAPR manufacturer instructions must be followed.

The components of NIOSH-approved PAPRs vary considerably among manufacturers, and they react differently to cleaning and disinfection solutions and procedures. Manufacturers’ cleaning and disinfection solutions and procedures also vary. These important maintenance activities can cause damage or deteriorate PAPR facepieces, headgear components (hoods, helmets), breathing tubes (hoses), and batteries. If cleaning and disinfection solutions and procedures are ineffective, HCP may be at risk of contact transmission. For these reasons, manufacturers generally recommend that the filter component be discarded. Some employers may be able to follow manufacturer-specific instructions for conventional use, but the cost of doing so may make PAPRs a less desirable solution to achieve the necessary protection.

Cleaning and Disinfection of PAPR Components

PAPR use requires a robust maintenance program for repairing or replacing components that have become damaged during use, or during cleaning and disinfection and battery management procedures.6 Competent, trained staff are required to support the PAPR maintenance program.

Manufacturers recommend cleaning and disinfection procedures for PAPR components except for the HE filter/cartridge, which they generally recommend be discarded and replaced. Filter cartridges can be reused until they become so clogged that they reduce airflow or become visibly soiled or damaged. Clogging is not expected to be a factor in non-dusty environments such as healthcare settings. The outside of the filter cartridge can have surface cleaning and decontamination while the rest of the unit is being serviced. Viruses and bacteria causing acute respiratory infections can survive on respirator components for variable periods of time, from hours to weeks. Consequently, contaminated respirators must be handled, cleaned, and disinfected properly to reduce the possibility of the device serving as a fomite and contributing to disease transmission.7 According to OSHA, the employer may use other commercially available cleansers of equivalent disinfection quality if their use is recommended or approved by the respirator manufacturer.

Conventional use requires cleaning and disinfecting using either the procedures in OSHA’s Respiratory Protection Standard or the procedures recommended by the respirator manufacturer, provided they are at least as effective as OSHA’s.8 If an alternate procedure is used to clean and disinfect the PAPR and its components, it must be recommended or approved by the manufacturer.

In general, cleaning and disinfecting consists of dissembling the PAPR, cleaning and disinfecting components, thoroughly rinsing components, and reassembling the PAPR when components are dry. It is important to follow all steps set forth in the manufacturer’s instructions. Cleaning is recommended after each use, but the PAPR must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent them from becoming unsanitary.

As with reusable elastomeric respirators, manufacturers generally recommend PAPR HE filters and filter cartridges are not to be cleaned or disinfected. Unlike reusable elastomeric respirators, PAPRs use only HE filters. These filters can differ in their appearance and their attachment on, or fit into, the blower assembly. Routine maintenance is also required for battery charging, and/or replacement. The maintenance program for PAPRs requires a supply of replacement components, including HE filters/cartridges to support and maintain PAPR use.

CDC has provided thorough information on disinfecting equipment and surfaces potentially contaminated by coronaviruses.9 Specific instructions for cleaning and disinfecting PAPRs are not addressed.

Some disinfectants are powerful germicides, and their use requires special precautions such as adequate ventilation, use of clean non-sterile gloves, gowns, or face shields. Care must be taken during cleaning and disinfection to ensure the cleaning staff does not self-infect or injure themselves performing this work.

Cleaning and disinfection must be done by competent trained individuals. Centralizing this activity can ensure it is properly done.

Contingency and Crisis Capacity Considerations for Filter/Cartridge Cleaning and Disinfection

Because of necessity, PAPR components including filters may be treated differently for their cleaning and disinfection. Whereas conventional practice is to discard the filters after each use, contingency or crisis practices may necessitate cleaning and disinfecting the filter. The performance of some filter media can be degraded by contact with the disinfectant.

During surge situations, when manufacturer instructions are not available or adequate, and supply shortages exist, interim alternate procedures cleaning and disinfection procedures may be necessary and effective to reuse scarce or unavailable replacement components. However, interim alternate procedures could increase the risk of contact transmission or damage to the filter media if not done properly. Alternate procedures and risks must be considered to protect HCP and meet healthcare needs.

OSHA and manufacturer instructions for cleaning and disinfection lack specific details for implementing standardized procedures during healthcare use. They rely upon the user to augment their general cleaning and disinfection instructions. Therefore, healthcare facilities need to establish procedures that will be effective to render targeted pathogens inviable and not damage PAPR components intended to be re-used.

Most PAPR components can be cleaned, disinfected, and if not damaged, reused many times. PAPRs use only HE filters or filter cartridges. These can be very different in size, shape, and appearance.

Some filters are contained in a protective cartridge attached onto the blower assembly. These may have openings in the cartridge housing that expose the filter media, or they may be substantially protective enclosing the filter media that cannot be seen externally.

Other filters are not contained in a cartridge. These may be inserted into the blower assembly preventing filter media from outside exposures including cleaning and disinfectant wipes.

Cleaning

When removing organic and inorganic matter from the PAPR components, trained personnel should wear nitrile gloves to protect their hands and limit the potential for self-infection. Additional protective equipment such as gowns and face shields, as well as ventilation, may be required during cleaning and disinfection procedures. Cleaning solution contact with the filter media must be avoided.

A detergent or soap and warm water could be used to clean the surface of the exterior filter cartridge prior to disinfection. Carefully avoid contact with the filter media. Cleaning can be done using a clean, soft cloth dampened with warm water approximately 49°C (120°F) containing a mild pH neutral (pH 6-8) detergent and using a mechanical wiping action. Any component exposed to moisture during the cleaning process needs to be carefully and thoroughly dried. Other PAPR components may generally be cleaned using the manufacturer’s recommended procedures.

Disinfecting

The effectiveness of an alternate filter cartridge disinfection solution and procedure may be uncertain:

All crevices of many filter cartridge housings may not be reached with sufficient disinfection solution or be contacted for the period of time required to be effective.

The filter media may be degraded by contact with the disinfectant.

Filters and filter media must be carefully and thoroughly dried. Any remaining fugitive moisture could promote the growth or sustainability of certain pathogens.

Some PAPRs have filter cartridges or blower assemblies that prevent disinfectant contact with the filter media. If available, these PAPRs should be used in the contingency or crisis capacity strategy approaches. These PAPR designs provide added assurance that the filter media will not be contacted with the cleaning and disinfection solutions. These filter cartridges, as well as PAPR blowers may be wiped down repeatedly.

NOTE: PAPR HE filters used in industry are generally re-used until they are soiled, damaged, or reduce PAPR air flow below specified levels. Caution should be used when using the filter for a live virus, and a practical replacement cycle should be implemented until more is known.

Practices not approved by the manufacturer can increase the risk and uncertainty of re-using damaged or degraded components. This must be balanced against other available HCP protection options to sustain effective HCP protection and patient care.

Alternate procedures used during emergencies should be assessed and documented in the written RPP, including alternate cleaning and disinfection practices.

For disinfection, diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% ethyl alcohol, and EPA-registered household disinfectants for use against coronaviruses are effective.

For use of diluted household bleach solutions, follow disinfectant manufacturer’s instructions for proper disinfectant application, PPE, and ventilation.

Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date.

Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.

Most household bleach solutions contain 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (50,000 ppm available chlorine) to up to 12.5% sodium hypochlorite (~125,000 ppm). It is important to check the product label and follow the disinfection directions for use, dilution, and contact time. Adjust the ratio of bleach to water as needed to achieve appropriate concentration of sodium hypochlorite. Based on the EPA List N: Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2 products, 2500 ppm (0.25%) for 5 minutes is effective. Most readily available bleach is approximately 6% so 2/3 cup of bleach per gallon of cold tap water (1:24 dilution) for 5 minutes is appropriate. For bleach preparations containing 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, use ¾ cup of bleach per 1 gallon of cold tap water for 5 minutes. If a lower concentration of bleach is desired, the EPA standard disinfection rate for hypochlorite products is 600 ppm for 10 minutes. That is, use 3 tablespoons of bleach per 1 gallon of cold tap water for 10 minutes.

Prepare a fresh bleach solution each day in a well-ventilated area. Always add bleach to cold water, not water to bleach.

Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims external iconare expected to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).

Disinfectants listed on the EPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products for Use Against Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could be used to inactivate the virus.10 Those intended for use with soft surfaces may be preferred.

CAUTION: The following may degrade or damage the respirator components.

Strong solutions such as hypochlorite, iodine and high concentrations of alcohol may degrade, deteriorate or extract chemical additives from certain PAPR materials.

Healthcare sterilization processes including ethylene oxide should not be used unless authorized by the respirator manufacturer as they may degrade and alter the shape of the facepiece.

Steam sterilization equipment should not be used unless indicated as safe for the use by the specific respirator manufacturer.

Some EPA-approved disinfectants are also available as ready to use at 2700 ppm for 1 minute; however, these strong solutions could impact the integrity of the respirator components.

Steps for cleaning and disinfecting PAPR components

The following is a general step-by-step process for cleaning and disinfecting PAPR components. PAPR manufacturers may not authorize these steps; however, during crisis operations when conventional procedures are not feasible, these steps could extend the supply of PAPR components.

If alternate cleaning or disinfection instructions are authorized, it is important to follow the facility’s established infection control practices for cleaning organic and inorganic materials and infectious organisms including the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019.

Healthcare practitioners should always wear the required proper personal protective equipment (PPE) during cleaning and disinfecting respirator components. These workers should always follow the disinfecting agent manufacturer’s user instructions regarding usability, application, dilution ratio and contact time, and ensure all components are thoroughly rinsed with clean, warm water and thoroughly dried before use or storage. In addition, PAPR facepieces or headgear worn by more than one user must be cleaned and disinfected before being worn by a different user in shared situations.

There are several basic steps to clean and disinfect PAPR components – dissemble, clean, disinfect, rinse and dry, inspect, repair or replace, and store. The order and details of each step are important. PAPR components can be stored and reassembled, or reassembly can be done before use.

Detach the battery pack, breathing tube, waist belt, facepiece/headgear, and filter/cartridge from the motor/blower assembly. If a breathing tube disposable cover was used, discard it properly. First clean the surface of each PAPR component except for the filter media after each use. Removing organic and inorganic materials from the component surfaces will help achieve maximally effective disinfection.11 Using a mechanical process, clean all components (except filter/cartridge and breathing tube disposable cover) of the PAPR assembly with a clean, soft cloth dampened with warm water that is approximately 43°C (120°F), containing a mild pH neutral (pH 6-8) detergent.

Caution: Do not soak, dip or immerse PAPR components in the cleaning or disinfection solutions unless specifically recommended by the manufacturer. Do not allow liquid to enter the air outlet or inlet port or the motor/blower housing area.

Clean the outer battery pack surface. Use caution cleaning around the battery pack connector pins where the battery contacts with the motor/blower unit or cord. Ensure this area and the pins are thoroughly dry before next use or storage.

Clean the breathing tube by wiping it down. Alternatively, you may immerse the elastomeric breathing tube in the cleaning solution. Disinfect the outer surfaces of the PAPR components by wiping with disinfectant including motor/blower, battery pack, breathing tube, and waist belt with a clean, soft cloth dampened with the appropriate disinfectant cleaners recommended or approved by the manufacturer. Follow the user instructions for the selected disinfectants. Caution: Never soak, dip, or immerse the motor/blower assembly or battery pack in disinfectant. In addition to the disinfection solutions described above, a study of disinfectants against coronavirus 229E found several that were effective after a 1-minute contact time; these included sodium hypochlorite (at a free chlorine concentration of 1,000 ppm and 5,000 ppm), 70% ethyl alcohol.12 Rinse thoroughly, wiping each component with a clean, soft cloth dampened with fresh water warmed to a temperature of approximately 43°C (120°F). Dry thoroughly before use or storage. Allow the breathing tube to completely air dry prior to reuse or storage. Air dry in an uncontaminated atmosphere, temperature not to exceed 43°C (120°F). Alternately, dry by connecting to the motor/blower unit and use it to force air through the tube until dry. Any remaining moisture could contribute to pathogen growth or sustainability. Inspect and repair or replace damaged components (facepiece/headgear, breathing tube, blower, belts) following PAPR manufacturer’s instructions. Store components in a clean, dry location away from contamination. Alternatively, reassemble the PAPR as described in the manufacturer’s user instructions, and store it so that it is ready for reuse in a clean, dry location away from contamination.

PAPR components may become damaged or deteriorated with prolonged or extended use of disinfecting products. Competent, trained staff must inspect the components of their PAPR following each disinfection and prior to re-use of components. Additionally, the user should always inspect the components of their PAPR prior to each use and report any damaged components. Damaged components should be repaired or replaced according to user instructions.

Recommendations from recent research studies and manufacturer reports

Alternate cleaning and disinfection procedures have been studied and found to be generally effective for use during a pandemic.12 13 Procedures were used to clean and disinfect components inoculated with H1N1 influenza A/PR/8/34 (ATCC VR-1469).

PAPR blowers, batteries, hoods/helmets, breathing tubes, and belts were manually cleaned with 0.5% Neutrawash and subsequently disinfected with PDI SaniCloth™ wipes.

PAPR components were alternately contaminated then cleaned and disinfected dozens of time. A sponge dampened with soap and water was used to first clean the PAPR hoods and blower units followed by wiping with a disinfecting wipe. The wipe used was PDI™ Super SaniCloth™.

Each PAPR component except for the filter/cartridge was wiped with an autoclavable sponge moistened with a 42°C, 0.5% Neutrawash detergent solution and subsequently wiped with another autoclavable sponge soaked in 42°C water only to remove any detergent.

PAPRs were then wiped with a Super SaniCloth™ and allowed to dry for two minutes. Specific protocols are described in the referenced documents concerning cleaning and disinfection of PAPR components except for the filter/cartridge.

While these methods have been demonstrated to be effective at disinfecting PAPRs, caution should be used as some manufacturers have reported that PDI™ AF3 Saniwipes can damage some PAPR components. The chemicals in them cause crazing (a rapid and sever embrittlement of plastics). Chemical compatibility for PAPR components is not well understood. These compounds are referred to as quaternary ammonium compounds, which PAPR manufacturers strongly recommend should be avoided. These disinfectants have been shown to be incompatible with some materials and do not have proven efficacy against all microorganisms.11

If following these procedures and applying them to filter cartridges during periods when supplies are limited or not available, extreme care must be taken to prevent cleaning and disinfectant contact with the filter media. External surfaces of filters cartridges should be carefully wiped, not dipped, soaked, or submerged when applying the cleaning and disinfectant solutions.

Practices not approved by the manufacturer can increase the risk and uncertainty of re-using damaged or degraded components. This must be balanced against other available HCP protection options to sustain effective HCP protection and patient care when supplies are limited or not available.

Modified procedures used during emergencies, including alternate cleaning and disinfection practices, should be documented and evaluated frequently throughout the crisis operation.

Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks: COVID-19,"Audience: These considerations are intended for use by federal, state, and local public health officials; leaders in occupational health services and infection prevention and control programs; and other leaders in healthcare settings who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing pathogen transmission in healthcare settings.

Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of facemasks in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness plans.

Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden increase in patient volume that would severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of facemasks during the COVID-19 response. To help healthcare facilities plan and optimize the use of facemasks in response to COVID-19, CDC has developed a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve facemask supplies along the continuum of care.

Conventional capacity : measures consisting of engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment (PPE) controls that should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings.

Contingency capacity : measures that may be used temporarily during periods of expected facemask shortages. Contingency capacity strategies should only be implemented after considering and implementing conventional capacity strategies. While current supply may meet the facility’s current or anticipated utilization rate, there may be uncertainty if future supply will be adequate and, therefore, contingency capacity strategies may be needed.

: measures that may be used temporarily during periods of expected facemask shortages. Contingency capacity strategies should only be implemented after considering and implementing conventional capacity strategies. While current supply may meet the facility’s current or anticipated utilization rate, there may be uncertainty if future supply will be adequate and, therefore, contingency capacity strategies may be needed. Crisis capacity: strategies that are not commensurate with U.S. standards of care but may need to be considered during periods of known facemask shortages. Crisis capacity strategies should only be implemented after considering and implementing conventional and contingency capacity strategies. Facilities can consider crisis capacity strategies when the supply is not able to meet the facility’s current or anticipated utilization rate.

CDC’s optimization strategies for facemask supply offer a continuum of options for use when facemask supplies are stressed, running low, or exhausted. Contingency and then crisis capacity measures augment conventional capacity measures and are meant to be considered and implemented sequentially. As facemask availability returns to normal, healthcare facilities should promptly resume standard practices.

Decisions to implement contingency and crisis strategies are based upon these assumptions:

Facilities understand their facemask inventory and supply chain Facilities understand their facemask utilization rate Facilities are in communication with local healthcare coalitions, federal, state, and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) to identify additional supplies Facilities have already implemented other engineering and administrative control measures including:

Use physical barriers and other engineering controls Limit number of patients going to hospital or outpatient settings Use telemedicine whenever possible Exclude all HCP not directly involved in patient care Limit face-to-face HCP encounters with patients Exclude visitors to patients with known or suspected COVID-19 Cohort patients and/or HCP



Facilities have provided HCP with required education and training, including having them demonstrate competency with donning external icon and doffing, with any PPE ensemble that is used to perform job responsibilities, such as provision of patient care

Conventional Capacity Strategies

Use facemasks according to product labeling and local, state, and federal requirements.

FDA-cleared surgical masks are designed to protect against splashes and sprays and are prioritized for use when such exposures are anticipated, including surgical procedures.

Facemasks that are not regulated by FDA, such as some procedure masks, which are typically used for isolation purposes, may not provide protection against splashes and sprays.

Contingency Capacity Strategies

Decrease length of stay for medically stable patients with COVID-19.

Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a facemask is typically used by HCP.

Place facemasks in a secure and monitored site and provide facemasks to symptomatic patients upon check-in at entry points.

Healthcare facilities can consider removing all facemasks from public areas. Facemasks can be available to provide to symptomatic patients upon check in at entry points. All facemasks should be placed in a secure and monitored site. This is especially important in high-traffic areas like emergency departments.

Implement extended use of facemasks.

Extended use of facemasks is the practice of wearing the same facemask for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing the facemask between patient encounters.

The facemask should be removed and discarded if soiled, damaged, or hard to breathe through.

HCP must take care not to touch their facemask. If they touch or adjust their facemask they must immediately perform hand hygiene.

HCP should leave the patient care area if they need to remove the facemask.

Restrict facemasks for use by HCP, rather than asymptomatic patients (who might use cloth masks) for source control.

Have patients with symptoms of respiratory infection use tissues or other barriers to cover their mouth and nose.

Crisis Capacity Strategies

Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a facemask is typically used by HCP.

Use facemasks beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life during patient care activities.

If there is no date available on the facemask label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer. The user should visually inspect the product prior to use and, if there are concerns (such as degraded materials or visible tears), discard the product.

Implement limited re-use of facemasks.

Limited re-use of facemasks is the practice of using the same facemask by one HCP for multiple encounters with different patients but removing it after each encounter. As it is unknown what the potential contribution of contact transmission is for SARS-CoV-2, care should be taken to ensure that HCP do not touch outer surfaces of the mask during care, and that mask removal and replacement be done in a careful and deliberate manner.

The facemask should be removed and discarded if soiled, damaged, or hard to breathe through.

Not all facemasks can be re-used. Facemasks that fasten to the provider via ties may not be able to be undone without tearing and should be considered only for extended use, rather than re-use. Facemasks with elastic ear hooks may be more suitable for re-use.

HCP should leave patient care area if they need to remove the facemask. Facemasks should be carefully folded so that the outer surface is held inward and against itself to reduce contact with the outer surface during storage. The folded mask can be stored between uses in a clean sealable paper bag or breathable container.

Prioritize facemasks for selected activities such as:

For provision of essential surgeries and procedures

During care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated

During activities where prolonged face-to-face or close contact with a potentially infectious patient is unavoidable

For performing aerosol generating procedures, if respirators are no longer available

When No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include

Exclude HCP at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 from contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.

During severe resource limitations, consider excluding HCP who may be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.

Designate convalescent HCP for provision of care to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.

It may be possible to designate HCP who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 to preferentially provide care for additional patients with COVID-19. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection may have developed some protective immunity, but this has not yet been confirmed.

Use a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face with no facemask.

Consider use of expedient patient isolation rooms for risk reduction.

Portable fan devices with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration that are carefully placed can increase the effective air changes per hour of clean air to the patient room, reducing risk to individuals entering the room without respiratory protection. NIOSH has developed guidance for using portable HEPA filtration systems to create expedient patient isolation rooms. The expedient patient isolation room approach involves establishing a high-ventilation-rate, negative pressure, inner isolation zone that sits within a “clean” larger ventilated zone.

Consider use of ventilated headboards

NIOSH has developed the ventilated headboard that draws exhaled air from a patient in bed into a HEPA filter, decreasing risk of HCP exposure to patient-generated aerosol. This technology consists of lightweight, sturdy, and adjustable aluminum framing with a retractable plastic canopy. The ventilated headboard can be deployed in combination with HEPA fan/filter units to provide surge isolation capacity within a variety of environments, from traditional patient rooms to triage stations, and emergency medical shelters.

HCP use of homemade masks:

In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.",2/11/20 0:00,
Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of Eye Protection: COVID-19,"Audience: These considerations are intended for use by federal, state, and local public health officials; leaders in occupational health services and infection prevention and control programs; and other leaders in healthcare settings who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing pathogen transmission in healthcare settings.

Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of eye protection in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness plans.

Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden increase in patient volume that would severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no widely accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of eye protection during the COVID-19 response. To help healthcare facilities plan and optimize the use of eye protection in response to COVID-19, CDC has developed a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve glove supplies along the continuum of care.

Conventional capacity: measures consisting of engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment (PPE) controls that should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings.

Cohort patients and/or HCP

Facilities have provided HCP with required education and training, including having them demonstrate competency with donning external icon and doffing, with any PPE ensemble that is used to perform job responsibilities, such as provision of patient care

Once availability of eye protection returns to normal, healthcare facilities should promptly resume conventional practices. Determining the appropriate time to return to conventional strategies can be challenging. Considerations affecting this decision include:

the number of patients requiring Transmission-Based Precautions (e.g., number of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) whether there is evidence of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the facility the incidence of COVID-19 in the community the number of days’ supply of PPE items currently remaining at the facility whether or not the facility is receiving regular resupply with its full allotment.

Conventional Capacity Strategies

Use eye protection according to product labeling and local, state, and federal requirements.

Contingency Capacity Strategies

Decrease length of stay for medically stable patients with COVID-19.

Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which eye protection is typically used by HCP.

Shift eye protection supplies from disposable to re-usable devices (i.e., goggles and reusable face shields).

Consider preferential use of powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) or full-face elastomeric respirators which have built-in eye protection.

Ensure appropriate cleaning and disinfection between users if goggles or reusable face shields are used.

Implement extended use of eye protection.

Extended use of eye protection is the practice of wearing the same eye protection for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing eye protection between patient encounters. Extended use of eye protection can be applied to disposable and reusable devices.

Eye protection should be removed and reprocessed if it becomes visibly soiled or difficult to see through. If a disposable face shield is reprocessed, it should be dedicated to one HCP and reprocessed whenever it is visibly soiled or removed (e.g., when leaving the isolation area) prior to putting it back on. See protocol for removing and reprocessing eye protection below.

Eye protection should be discarded if damaged (e.g., face shield can no longer fasten securely to the provider, if visibility is obscured and reprocessing does not restore visibility).

HCP should take care not to touch their eye protection. If they touch or adjust their eye protection they must immediately perform hand hygiene.

HCP should leave patient care area if they need to remove their eye protection. See protocol for removing and reprocessing eye protection below.

Crisis Capacity Strategies

Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which eye protection is typically used by HCP.

Use eye protection devices beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life during patient care activities.

If there is no date available on the eye protection device label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer. The user should visually inspect the product prior to use and, if there are concerns (such as degraded materials), discard the product.

Prioritize eye protection for selected activities such as:

During care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, which typically includes aerosol generating procedures.

During activities where prolonged face-to-face or close contact with a potentially infectious patient is unavoidable.

Consider using safety glasses (e.g., trauma glasses) that have extensions to cover the side of the eyes. However, protective eyewear (e.g., safety glasses, trauma glasses) with gaps between glasses and the face likely do not protect eyes from all splashes and sprays.

Exclude HCP at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 from contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.

During severe resource limitations, consider excluding HCP who may be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.

Designate convalescent HCP for provision of care to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.

Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of Isolation Gowns,"Once PPE supplies and availability return to normal, healthcare facilities should promptly resume conventional practices. Summary of updates as of October 9, 2020: Added considerations for returning to conventional capacity practices.

Moved the use of reusable (i.e., washable or cloth) isolation gowns to conventional capacity strategies.

Edited the section on consideration of the use of coveralls.

Added language to the section on prioritizing the use of gowns.

Moved the crisis capacity strategy of re-use of isolation gowns to the bottom of the list and added cautionary statements about the risks of this strategy on HCP and patient safety.

Audience: These considerations are intended for use by federal, state, and local public health officials; leaders in occupational health services and infection prevention and control programs; and other leaders in healthcare settings who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing pathogen transmission in healthcare settings.

Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of isolation gowns in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness tools.

Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden increase in patient volume that would severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no widely accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of isolation gowns relative to need during the COVID-19 response. To help healthcare facilities plan and optimize the use of gowns in response to COVID-19, CDC has developed a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve isolation gown supplies along the continuum of care.

Conventional Capacity Strategies

Note: In general, CDC does not recommend the use of more than one isolation gown at a time by HCP when providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Use isolation gown alternatives that offer equivalent or higher protection.

Several fluid-resistant and impermeable protective clothing options are available in the marketplace for HCP. These include isolation gowns and surgical gowns. When selecting the most appropriate protective clothing, employers should consider all of the available information on recommended protective clothing, including the potential limitations. Nonsterile, disposable patient isolation gowns, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for use by HCP when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In times of gown shortages, surgical gowns should be prioritized for surgical and other sterile procedures. Current U.S. guidelines do not require use of gowns that conform to any standards. In March 2020, FDA issued an enforcement policy for gowns and other apparelexternal icon during the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorizationexternal icon regarding the use of certain gowns in healthcare settings.

Reusable (i.e., washable) gowns are typically made of polyester or polyester-cotton fabrics. Gowns made of these fabrics can be safely laundered after each use according to routine procedures and reused.

Laundry operations and personnel may need to be augmented to facilitate additional washing loads and cycles. Systems are established to:

routinely inspect, maintain (e.g., mend a small hole in a gown, replace missing fastening ties)

replace reusable gowns when needed (e.g., when they are thin or ripped)

store laundered gowns in a manner such that they remain clean until use.

Contingency Capacity Strategies

Decrease length of stay for medically stable patients with COVID-19.

Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a gown is typically used by HCP.

Consider the use of coveralls.

Coveralls are less convenient to use in most healthcare settings. Their one-piece design covers the back and lower legs, in addition to arms and the front of the body, making them useful for situations in which vigorous physical mobility is anticipated (e.g., emergency medical services). If coveralls are used, the material and seams should be appropriate to serve the intended barrier function effectively. Facilities should anticipate challenges and potential hazards to staff related to doffing coveralls and should provide training and practice in their safe use and designated places for donning and doffing, before providing them for patient care.

In the United States, the NFPA 1999 standardexternal icon specifies the minimum design, performance, testing, documentation, and certification requirements for new single-use and new multiple-use emergency medical operations protective clothing, including coveralls for HCP.

Use of gowns beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training.

The majority of isolation gowns do not have a manufacturer-designated shelf life. However, consideration can be made to using gowns that do and are past their manufacturer-designated shelf life. If there is no shelf life information available on the gown label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer.

Use gowns or coveralls conforming to international standards.

Current guidelines do not require use of gowns that conform to any regulatory standards. In times of shortages, healthcare facilities can consider using international gowns and coveralls. Gowns and coveralls that conform to international standards, including with EN 13795 high performance gowns and EN14126 Class 5–6 coveralls, could be reserved for activities that may involve moderate to high amounts of body fluids.

Crisis Capacity Strategies

Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a gown is typically used by HCP.

Extended use of isolation gowns.

Consideration can be made to extend the use of isolation gowns (disposable or reusable) such that the same gown is worn by the same HCP when interacting with more than one patient housed in the same location and known to be infected with the same infectious disease (i.e., COVID-19 patients residing in an isolation cohort). However, this can be considered only if there are no additional co-infectious diagnoses transmitted by contact (such as Clostridioides difficile, Candida auris) among patients. If the gown becomes visibly soiled, it must be removed and discarded or changed as per usual practicespdf icon.

Prioritize gowns.

Gowns should be prioritized for the following activities:

During care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, which typically includes aerosol generating procedures

During the following high-contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to other patients and staff via the soiled clothing of healthcare providers, such as: Dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use, wound care



Surgical gowns should be prioritized for surgical and other sterile procedures. If used for isolation purposes, the gown must be removed and changed if it becomes soiled, as per usual practicespdf icon. Different areas of the surgical gown may provide different levels of barrier protection. Facilities may consider suspending use of gowns for endemic multidrug resistant organisms (e.g., MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing organisms). Note: the organisms that are considered endemic can vary in different regions. In general, isolation gowns, as part of Contact Precautions, should continue to be used for patients colonized or infected with emerging highly-resistant organisms including Candida auris, carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, and pan-resistant organisms.

Consider using gown alternatives.

In situation of severely limited or no available isolation gowns, the following pieces of clothing can be considered as a last resort for care of COVID-19 patients as single use. However, none of these options can be considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Preferable features include long sleeves and closures (snaps, buttons) that can be fastened and secured.

Disposable laboratory coats

Reusable (washable) patient gowns

Reusable (washable) laboratory coats

Disposable aprons

Combinations of pieces of clothing can be considered for activities that may involve high amounts of body fluids and when there are no gowns available:

Reusable patient gowns and lab coats can be safely laundered according to routine procedures.

Laundry operations and personnel may need to be augmented to facilitate additional washing loads and cycles

Systems are established to routinely inspect, maintain (e.g., mend a small hole in a gown, replace missing fastening ties) and replace reusable gowns when needed (e.g., when they are thin or ripped)

Re-use of isolation gowns.

The risks to HCP and patient safety must be carefully considered before implementing a gown reuse strategy. Disposable gowns generally should NOT be re-used, and reusable gowns should NOT be reused before laundering, because reuse poses risks for possible transmission among HCP and patients that likely outweigh any potential benefits. Similar to extended gown use, gown reuse has the potential to facilitate transmission of organisms (e.g., C. auris) among patients. However, unlike extended use, repeatedly donning and doffing a contaminated gown may increase risk for HCP self-contamination. If reuse is considered, gowns should be dedicated to care of individual patients. Any gown that becomes visibly soiled during patient care should be disposed of or, if reusable, laundered.",2/11/20 0:00,
Strategies to Allocate Ventilators from Stockpiles to Facilities,"During a large-scale public health emergency involving a respiratory disease like COVID-19, federal, state, or local stockpiled ventilators should be deployed in a way that optimizes the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of this scarce resource. Decisions on the allocation of stockpiled ventilators to facilities should be based on multiple factors, including:1

Assessment of need

Determination of facilities’ ability to absorb additional ventilators

Ethical considerations to inform how this scarce resource is provided to facilities to save as many lives as possible

Input from state and local leadership, legal and ethical experts, and informed stakeholders

State and local planners can use the strategies in this guide to assist them when allocating ventilators from public health stockpiles to hospitals and other facilities during a pandemic.

Assessment of need: Use available surveillance data to predict the number of ventilators needed 2 Growth in number of daily cases (increasing, stable, decreasing) Number of hospitalizations Percentage of hospitalizations with critical illness requiring critical care Percentage of critically ill patients needing ventilatory support

Assess the number of ventilators currently available for use by each facility Ventilators currently not in use or in storage Ventilators anticipated to be available from surge contracts or sharing agreements Ventilators in use that may be available for future use



Facility’s ability to absorb additional ventilators: Identify facilities that may have capacity to care for critically ill patients who will need mechanical ventilation (from prior or current assessments).

Quantify the number of additional ventilators each facility can realistically absorb. Base this estimate on having enough trained and qualified staff, space, and necessary equipment needed for caring for additional patients on mechanical ventilation. 3

Determine the population size that each hospital serves and assess the capacity of each facility to serve vulnerable and high-risk populations within this area.

Consider whether each hospital serves as a referral hospital/regional hospital or serves a high-density population area, rural area, or underserved populations.

Ethical considerations to inform ventilator allocation:4 Use ethical principles to guide the development and implementation of ventilator allocation plans. Will the allocation plan use scarce resources in a manner that will save as many lives as possible? 5 Does the allocation plan apply criteria consistently across all hospitals/facilities in the jurisdiction? If ventilators are insufficient to meet the needs of all those who would benefit from them, what are plans for providing care for patients who cannot access them? Does the plan include ways to clearly and transparently communicate the framework for allocation decisions to facility leadership, stakeholders, and to the general public?



Develop a plan for logistical issues for distribution: Create distribution plans assuming that once ventilators have been allocated to a facility, they are unlikely to be reallocated.

Ensure that ventilators stockpiled locally are ready to be put into service.

Public Health Activity Guidance,"Audience: Managers and their staff engaged in public health clinic settings and field outreach activities in state and local health departments. Purpose: To provide guidance for the management of public health workers engaged in public health activities that require face-to-face interaction with clients in clinic and field settings. These activities would include prevention and control programs for TB, STDs, HIV, and other infectious disease activities that would require outbreak or contact investigation, home visits, or partner services, and non-infectious disease-specific programs, e.g., syringe services programs, or occupational health activities.

Overview

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has forced public health to reassess its approach to providing care while keeping staff and patients safe. Mitigation strategies, such as social distancing and sheltering in place, have impacted clinical care and field services across the nation. As a result, many jurisdictions have limited face-to-face interactions to only the most essential.

It is important to protect healthcare and public health workers from COVID-19 while maintaining their ability to deliver critical public health services. State, local, tribal, and territorial public health programs need flexibility to reassign tasks and shift priorities to meet these competing needs. This document provides guidance for protecting public health workers engaged in public health activities that require face-to-face interaction with clients in clinic and field settings. The guidance has the following objectives:

minimizing risk of exposure, illness, and spread of disease among staff conducting public health emergency response operations and essential public health functions;

minimizing risk of exposure, illness, and spread of disease among members of the public at public health facilities; and

preserving essential functions and mission capabilities of state, territorial, local, and tribal health departments.

Prioritization

Activities that should receive highest priority will vary with the level of community COVID-19 transmission, characteristics of the priority populations to be served, local capacity to implement effective prevention and control activities, and availability of effective interventions. Points to consider include:

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updates guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the CDC COVID-19 website periodically for updated guidance.

Activation of federal emergency plans may provide additional authorities and coordination needed for interventions to be implemented. State and local laws and declarations may impact how resources can be appropriated and allocated and staff reassigned. Section 319(e) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act authorizes states and tribes to request the temporary reassignment of state, territorial, local, or tribal public health department or agency personnel funded under federal programs as authorized by the PHS Act when the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has declared a public health emergency. For more details: https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/pahpa/section201/Pages/default.aspx external icon

When developing prioritization plans, health departments should identify ways to ensure the safety and social well-being of staff, including front line staff, and staff at increased risk for severe illness.

Activities may vary across settings (clinical vs nonclinical) and by type of staff (office staff, physicians, nurses, disease intervention specialists (DIS), etc.) based on identified critical needs/services established by the health department and local authorities.

Depending on the level of community spread, public health departments may need to implement prioritization and preservation strategies for public health functions for identifying cases and conducting contact tracing. For HIV, TB, STD, and Viral Hepatitis prevention and control programs, recommended prioritization strategies based on level of community spread are presented as an Appendix to this document.

Phased Approaches and Strategies for Face-to-Face Activities

Consistent with CDC’s guidance for implementation of prevention strategies for communities with local COVID-19 transmission (see community mitigation strategypdf icon), this adapted table lays out two sets of strategies that public health departments should use based on the current level of COVID-19 community transmission.

Phased Approaches and Strategies for Face-to-Face Activities None to Minimal Transmission* Minimal to Substantial Transmission Evidence of isolated cases or limited community transmission, case investigations underway, continued open capacity of hospitals and urgent care centers. Minimal to moderate: Widespread and/or sustained transmission to large scale community transmission, with high likelihood or confirmed exposure within communal settings and potential for rapid increase in suspected cases. Substantial: Large scale community transmission, healthcare staffing significantly impacted, multiple cases within communal settings like healthcare facilities, schools, mass gatherings etc. Identify critical public health activities

Plan for discontinuation of non-essential public health activities

Plan for implementation of flexible work (e.g., telework) and sick leave policies

Implement triage prior to entering facilities to rapidly identify and isolate patients with respiratory illness (e.g., phone triage before patient arrival, triage upon arrival)

Isolate patients exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19

Develop alternate telemedicine practices for patients exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases

Within health department settings, implement social distancing measures, and encourage increased hand hygiene (access to soap and water and alcohol-based hand sanitizer, tissues), encourage respiratory hygiene (face masks and respirators), increased cleaning and disinfection Discontinue non-essential public health activities

Encourage telework options for staff when possible

Encourage strict use of respiratory protection and other PPE in situations that require working with clients in close proximity (including during patient visits, specimen collection, DIS field visits)

Encourage strict implementation of phone triage and telemedicine practices where possible

Isolate patients exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19

Implement social distancing practices (e.g., placing tape on floors to establish proper spacing between people)

*Assuming there is adequate availability of quality diagnostic information. In the absence of such information, other sources of judgement should be sought, such as local public health officials, hospital guidance, or local health care providers.

Consideration of Worker Risk Level

Workers’ risk of occupational exposure may vary based on the nature of their work. Public health programs should assess potential risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19, especially for those staff whose job functions require working with clients in close proximity and in locations where there is known community transmission. While not all public health staff fall into the category of healthcare personnel (HCP), conducting medical exams or specimen collection procedures where risk of exposure is high, many public health activities for disease prevention and intervention involve face-to-face interactions with patients, partners, and organizations, putting public health staff at risk for acquiring COVID-19.

Per CDC guidance (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html), close contact is defined as: a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a person with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a person with COVID-19, – or – b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a person with COVID-19 such as being coughed on.

Public health staff should wear appropriate PPE for the job function that they are performing, in accordance with state and local guidance. CDC has issued guidance to provide a framework for the assessment and management of potential exposures to the virus that causes COVID-19 and implementation of safeguards based on a person’s risk level and clinical presentation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html. This guidance is updated routinely. Please see the CDC website for additional information about levels of risk.

Protective Measures that Pertain to All Work Settings

Public health departments should protect staff as they perform their work functions, and implement workplace strategies (see https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3990.pdfpdf iconexternal icon) that mitigate transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. Protective measures for public health staff may vary by state and local health jurisdiction and should be guided by both state and local community transmission, the type of work that public health staff perform and the associated transmission risk, and state and local resources. Additional guidance for health departments can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/index.html.

Engineering controls include:

Use high-efficiency air filters

Increase ventilation rates in the work environment

Install physical barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards, if feasible

In healthcare settings, such as public health clinics, use airborne infection isolation rooms for aerosol generating procedures

Administrative controls include:

Educate workers on up-to-date information on COVID-19

Train workers on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors including: Use of respiratory protection and other personal protective equipment (PPE) Who needs to use protective clothing and equipment, and in which situations specific types of PPE are needed How to put on, use/wear, and take PPE off correctly, especially in the context of their current and potential duties

Encourage ill employees to stay home. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible and non-punitive.

Provide resources and a work environment that promote personal hygiene. For example, provide tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol, disinfectants, and disposable towels for workers to clean their work surfaces; and Require regular hand washing or using of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and washing hands always when they are visibly soiled and after removing any PPE.



Protective Measures That Pertain to Public Health Clinical Settings

In public health clinical settings, it is important to prepare to safely triage and manage patients with respiratory illness, including COVID-19. All healthcare facilities should be aware of any updates to local and state public health recommendations.

For healthcare settings, key guidance includes:

Minimize the numbers of staff providing care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html),

Implement policies to reduce face-to-face interactions by deferring non-urgent visits or use of telemedicine appointments, video or phone calls to provide treatment without a physical appointment, and referring others that require physical exam for further evaluation,

Implement symptom screening and triage patients before they come to the clinic and provide respiratory protection (masks) to patients

Install barriers to limit contact with patients at triage,

Emphasize hand hygiene

Provide appropriate PPE for staff ‘s role,

Implement PPE optimization strategies to extend supplies (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/index.html).

Program managers may need to provide additional precautions while collecting specimens. Screening and symptom monitoring of staff who continue to work should also be implemented.

Published infection prevention and control guidance for preparing for and managing patients with COVID-19 in healthcare settings is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html, with specific guidance for the clinic setting available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinic-preparedness.html, and includes:

Providing visual alerts (signs, posters) at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette.

Ensuring supplies are available (tissues, waste receptacles, alcohol-based hand sanitizer).

Making face masks available at triage for patients.

Creating an area for spatially separating patients with respiratory symptoms, by providing space so that patients would be >6 feet apart in waiting areas. If facilities lack waiting areas, then designated areas or waiting lines should be created by partitioning or through signage.

Reducing crowding in waiting rooms, given the highly infectious nature and gravity of COVID-19; consider asking patients waiting to be seen to stay outside and away from others or in their vehicles (if appropriate) until they are called into the facility for their appointment; alternatively, triage booths can be set up to screen patients safely.

Some facilities such as clinics, grocery stores, and banks in areas with high community transmission have found success with:

Use of tape and signs on the ground to designate waiting areas outside and inside buildings which are 8 feet apart,

Requiring use of face masks or other respiratory protection,

Limiting building access to 10 people at a time, with a door monitor allowing one person inside for each person that exits,

Providing hand sanitizer and face masks for patients upon entry into the facility for a physical appointment.

Protections that Pertain to Field-Based Public Health Staff

While existing recommendations focus primarily on healthcare settings, some public health programs have field-based public health staff that require protection. Staff who have close contact with patients should be equipped and trained on the use of appropriate respiratory protection and other PPE, as indicated by the current level of community transmission, and job function. For those having face-to-face interaction with patients for a disease-specific program, more comprehensive PPE may be indicated, depending upon the context, prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, degree of contact with the client, and healthcare activity pursued. For those working with persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and their asymptomatic close contacts at their home or non-home residential settings, CDC has specific guidance: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/guidance-evaluating-pui.html.

For contact tracing, public health programs should consider implementing technology assisted models for client interaction such as those employed increasingly by tuberculosis programs (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/highimpactprevention/promising-hip-intervention.html), used for monitoring of returning travelers for Ebola, and implemented by sexually transmitted infection programs for partner services. Technology assisted models include those that are synchronous (such as video chat via Skype, Facetime, Webex, or Zoom, text message, and other social media) and asynchronous (such as recorded video of directly observed therapy (DOT)).

While the use of social media and smart phones is ubiquitous, not all patients have access to this technology. Patients in need of infectious disease testing and treatment services may also be persons experiencing homelessness, drug use, and mental health diagnoses. To facilitate disease prevention and control, public health programs must meet these patients where they are, providing field-based support with face-to-face interactions and in-person assistance with navigation of services. In these instances, public health staff should use appropriate PPE to prevent COVID-19 transmission. (See guidance on homelessness and COVID-19 at COVID-19 and unsheltered homelessness.) This may also include provision of face masks for patients, frequent adequate handwashing, and regular disinfection of commonly touched surfaces.

In situations where appropriate respiratory protection and other PPE are not available or community level transmission prevents face-to-face interactions, staff safety must be considered, and alternative means of contacting patients as mentioned above should be pursued.

Workplace Strategies to Mitigate Community Transmission and Maintain Continuity of Public Health Operations

Public health programs should collaborate with environmental health hospital acquired infections and occupational health programs in order to develop contingency plans to address what to do if a client comes in sick or tests positive, and what to do if an employee comes in sick or tests positive.

The possibility of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission increases the challenges of managing public health activities, underscoring the importance of prioritizing activities, use of respiratory protection and other PPE, social distancing to reduce exposure to and transmission of COVID-19, and limiting in-person care. Therefore, workers required to come to an office should wear face masks or cloth face coverings to prevent transmission.

Public health programs are encouraged to explore flexible workplace policies including telecommuting and increased sick leave. Programs should also explore telemedicine and other ways to use new technologies that may facilitate syndromic evaluation and treatment of patients.

Staff should be reminded to not report to work when they are ill. Be aware of recommended work restrictions and monitoring based on staff exposure to patients with COVID-19. Employees should be advised to check for any signs or symptoms of illness before reporting to work and to notify their supervisor if they become ill. Consider implementing a process of screening staff for fever or respiratory symptoms before entering the facility. Proactively plan for absenteeism with contingency planning that could include altering clinic hours, cross-training staff, or hiring temporary or additional employees.

Programs are encouraged to implement contingency plans to address the following: what to do if a large proportion of the workforce gets sick, what to do if staff need to provide childcare at home due to daycare or school closing, and interruptions in PPE supply.

These recommendations are aimed at assisting state, territorial, local, and tribal health departments to balance the competing demands of their routine infectious disease caseload throughout the COVID-19 response. CDC programs remain available to consult on disease-specific guidance to aid in prioritization of public health work activities.

Our thanks go out to the public health staff on the front lines who are working to balance these priorities and who rise daily to the challenge of the COVID-19 response.

Return-to-Work Criteria for Healthcare Workers,"CDC guidance for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be adapted by state and local health departments to respond to rapidly changing local circumstances.

Who this is for: Occupational health programs and public health officials making decisions about return to work for healthcare personnel (HCP) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, or who have suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., developed symptoms of COVID-19) but were never tested for SARS-CoV-2.

HCP with symptoms of COVID-19 should be prioritized for viral testing with approved nucleic acid or antigen detection assays. When a clinician decides that testing a person for SARS-CoV-2 is indicated, negative results from at least one FDA Emergency Use Authorized COVID-19 molecular viral assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA indicates that the person most likely does not have an active SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time the sample was collected. A second test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be performed at the discretion of the evaluating healthcare provider, particularly when a higher level of clinical suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection exists. For HCP who were suspected of having COVID-19 and had it ruled out, either with at least one negative test or a clinical decision that COVID-19 is not suspected and testing is not indicated, then return to work decisions should be based on their other suspected or confirmed diagnoses.

Decisions about return to work for HCP with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be made in the context of local circumstances. In general, a symptom-based strategy should be used as described below. The time period used depends on the HCP’s severity of illness and if they are severely immunocompromised.1

A test-based strategy is no longer recommended (except as noted below) because, in the majority of cases, it results in excluding from work HCP who continue to shed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA but are no longer infectious.

Other Resources:

For guidance about assessment of risk and application of work restrictions for asymptomatic HCP with potential exposure to patients, visitors, or other HCP with confirmed COVID-19, refer to the Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Work Restrictions for Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure to COVID-19.

Return to Work Criteria for HCP with SARS-CoV-2 Infection

Symptom-based strategy for determining when HCP can return to work.

HCP with mild to moderate illness who are not severely immunocompromised:

At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared and

At least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and

Symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved

Note: HCP who are not severely immunocompromised and were asymptomatic throughout their infection may return to work when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive viral diagnostic test.

HCP with severe to critical illness or who are severely immunocompromised1:

At least 10 days and up to 20 days have passed since symptoms first appeared

At least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and

Symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved

Consider consultation with infection control experts

Note: HCP who are severely immunocompromised but who were asymptomatic throughout their infection may return to work when at least 10 days and up to 20 days have passed since the date of their first positive viral diagnostic test.

As described in the Decision Memo, an estimated 95% of severely or critically ill patients, including some with severe immunocompromise, no longer had replication-competent virus 15 days after onset of symptoms; no patient had replication-competent virus more than 20 days after onset of symptoms. The exact criteria that determine which HCP will shed replication-competent virus for longer periods are not known. Disease severity factors and the presence of immunocompromising conditions should be considered in determining the appropriate duration for specific HCP. For example, HCP with characteristics of severe illness may be most appropriately managed with at least 15 days before return to work.

Test-Based Strategy for Determining when HCP Can Return to Work.

In some instances, a test-based strategy could be considered to allow HCP to return to work earlier than if the symptom-based strategy were used. However, as described in the Decision Memo, many individuals will have prolonged viral shedding, limiting the utility of this approach. A test-based strategy could also be considered for some HCP (e.g., those who are severely immunocompromised1) in consultation with local infectious diseases experts if concerns exist for the HCP being infectious for more than 20 days.

The criteria for the test-based strategy are:

HCP who are symptomatic:

Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and

Improvement in symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), and

Results are negative from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) tested using an FDA-authorized molecular viral assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

HCP who are not symptomatic:

Results are negative from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) tested using an FDA-authorized molecular viral assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Return to Work Practices and Work Restrictions

After returning to work, HCP should:

Wear a facemask for source control at all times while in the healthcare facility until all symptoms are completely resolved or at baseline. A facemask instead of a cloth face covering should be used by these HCP for source control during this time period while in the facility. After this time period, these HCP should revert to their facility policy regarding universal source control during the pandemic. A facemask for source control does not replace the need to wear an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator (or other recommended PPE) when indicated, including when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Self-monitor for symptoms, and seek re-evaluation from occupational health if symptoms recur or worsen.

Strategies to Mitigate Healthcare Personnel Staffing Shortages

Maintaining appropriate staffing in healthcare facilities is essential to providing a safe work environment for HCP and safe patient care. As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, staffing shortages will likely occur due to HCP exposures, illness, or need to care for family members at home. Healthcare facilities must be prepared for potential staffing shortages and have plans and processes in place to mitigate them, including considerations for permitting HCP to return to work without meeting all return to work criteria above. Refer to the Strategies to Mitigate Healthcare Personnel Staffing Shortages document for information.",2/11/20 0:00,
Interim Recommendations for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems and 911 Public Safety Answering Points/Emergency Communication Centers (PSAP/ECCs) in the United States During the Coronavirus Dise,"Updated July 15, 2020

Summary of Key Changes for the EMS Guidance:

Below are changes to the guidance as of July 15, 2020:

Reorganized recommendations into 2 sections: Recommended infection prevention and control (IPC) practices for routine activities during the pandemic. Recommended IPC practices when caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Added recommendations that were included in healthcare IPC FAQs addressing: Universal use of PPE for healthcare personnel working in communities with moderate to sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 Creating a process for responding to SARS-CoV-2 exposures among healthcare personnel and others.



Background

This interim guidance has been updated based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States. EMS practices should be based on the most up-to-date clinical recommendations and information from appropriate public health authorities and EMS medical direction about SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most recommendations in this updated guidance are not new (except as noted in the summary of changes above); they have been reorganized into the following sections:

Recommended infection prevention and control (IPC) practices for routine healthcare delivery during the pandemic.

Recommended IPC practices when caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

EMS play a vital role in responding to requests for assistance, triaging patients, and providing emergency medical treatment and transport for ill or injured persons. However, unlike patient care in the controlled environment of a healthcare facility, care and transports by EMS present unique challenges because of the nature of the setting, enclosed space during transport, frequent need for rapid medical decision-making, interventions with limited information, and a varying range of patient acuity and jurisdictional healthcare resources.

When preparing for and responding to patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, close coordination and effective communications are important among 911 Public Safety Answering Points/Emergence Communication Centers (PSAP/ECCs)— commonly known as 911 call centers, the EMS system, healthcare facilities, and the public health system. Each PSAP/ECC and EMS system should seek the involvement of an EMS medical director to provide appropriate medical oversight. When SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected in a patient needing emergency transport, prehospital care providers and healthcare facilities should be notified in advance that they may be caring for, transporting, or receiving a patient who might have SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This interim guidance applies to all EMS personnel (i.e., prehospital EMS and medical first responders involved in 911 responses or interfacility transfers) across multiple EMS models including, but not limited to, free standing, third-service, fire-based, hospital-based, and related EMS providers. Note that fire services are also included as they respond to emergency medical calls and may do so with or without an ambulance.

Additional Key Resources:

1. Recommended infection prevention and control (IPC) practices for routine healthcare delivery during the pandemic

CDC recommends using additional infection prevention and control practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with standard practices recommended as a part of routine healthcare delivery to all patients. These practices are intended to apply to all patients, not just those with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (See Section 2 for additional practices that should be used when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection).

Recommendations for 911 PSAP/ECCs

Municipalities and local EMS authorities should coordinate with state and local public health, PSAP/ECCs, and other emergency call centers to address the need for modified caller queries about SARS-CoV-2 infection, outlined below.

These modified caller queries should be developed in collaboration with an EMS medical director and informed by local, state, territorial, tribal and federal public health authorities, including the city or county health department(s), state health department(s), and CDC.

Modified Caller Queries

911 Public Safety Answering Points/Emergency Communication Centers (PSAP/ECCs) should question callers and determine whether the call concerns a person who might have SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., ask about signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or recent close contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection). The query process should never supersede the provision of pre-arrival instructions to the caller when immediate lifesaving interventions (e.g., CPR or the Heimlich maneuver) are indicated.

Information about a patient who might have SARS-CoV-2 infection should be communicated immediately to EMS personnel before arrival on scene in order to limit the number of EMS personnel exposed to the patient and to allow use of appropriate PPE. As part of pre-arrival instructions, PSAP/ECCs should encourage the universal use of cloth face coverings for all persons who are safely able to wear them at the scene prior to EMS arrival. PSAP/ECCs should utilize medical dispatch protocols that are approved by their EMS medical director in consultation with the local or state public health department. These protocols should be updated, as needed, to accommodate changes in EMS availability, and/or the redirection of low acuity calls to alternate disposition (e.g., nurse triage line, telemedicine triage line).

PSAP/ECCs and EMS units that respond to calls for ill travelers at US international airports or other ports of entry to the United States (maritime ports or border crossings) should be in contact with the CDC quarantine station of jurisdiction for the port of entry (see: CDC Quarantine Station Contact List) for planning guidance. They should notify the quarantine station when responding to that location if a communicable disease is suspected in a traveler. CDC has provided job aids for this purpose to EMS units operating routinely at US ports of entry. The PSAP/ECCs or EMS unit can also call CDC’s Emergency Operations Center at (770) 488-7100 to be connected with the appropriate CDC quarantine station.",2/11/20 0:00,

Healthcare Facilities: Managing Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Summary of Recent Changes Below are changes to the guidance as of June 9, 2020 Updated guidance to reflect the current understanding and ongoing response needs of healthcare systems and facilities. Previous guidance was preventative and meant to help healthcare facilities prepare for community transmission, while current guidance is for managing operations during the pandemic.

COVID-19 Healthcare Systems Tips CDC has been listening to and learning from the experiences of healthcare systems as they respond to COVID-19. CDC has developed a list of Ten Ways Healthcare Systems Can Operate Effectively during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Healthcare systems are encouraged to review and implement these approaches as they operate during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed how health care is delivered in the United States and has affected the operations of healthcare facilities. Effects may include increases in patients seeking care for respiratory illness that could be COVID-19, deferring and delaying non-COVID-19 care, disruptions in supply chains, fluctuations in facilities’ occupancy, absenteeism among staff because of illness or caregiving responsibilities, and increases in mental health concerns. Currently, no FDA-approved medications to treat COVID-19 or vaccines to prevent it are available.

Healthcare facilities need to provide care for all patients in the safest way possible for patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) and at the appropriate level, whether patients need home-based care, outpatient care, urgent care, emergency room care, inpatient care, or intensive care. This guidance outlines goals and strategies for U.S. healthcare facilities to operate effectively and safely during the COVID-19 pandemic and provides links to CDC guidance on providing care in different settings and situations.

This guidance offers recommendations for healthcare facilities to

Operate effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic

Adjust the way they deliver healthcare services to reduce the need to provide in-person care

Follow infection prevention and control recommendations tailored to their setting

Provide necessary in-person clinical services for conditions other than COVID-19 in the safest way possible, minimizing disease transmission to patients, HCP, and others

Adjusting the Way Healthcare Services Are Delivered During the COVID-19 Pandemic

During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems should adjust their standard approaches of delivering healthcare services to reduce the need to provide in-person care to minimize risk to patients and HCP.

Using Telehealth Services For helpful considerations and strategies to provide telehealth services, please visit ""Using Telehealth to Expand Access to Essential Health Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic"".

Optimize use of telehealth

Telehealth services should be optimized, when available and appropriate. The federal government has made telehealth services easier to implement and access (see: guidance for planning, preparing patients, and billing and reimbursementexternal icon for telehealth services). CDC considers that telehealth could be used to deliver the following services:

Screen patients who may have symptoms of COVID-19 and refer as appropriate.

Provide urgent care for non-COVID-19 conditions, identify higher acuity care needs, and refer patients as appropriate.

Access primary care providers and specialists, including mental and behavioral health care providers, for chronic health conditions and medication management.

Participate in physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other modalities as a hybrid approach to in-person care for optimal health

Monitor clinical signs of certain medical conditions remotely (like blood pressure and blood glucose levels).

Engage in case management for patients who have difficulty accessing care, including those who live in rural settings, older adults, or those with limited mobility.

Follow-up with patients after they are discharged from the hospital.

Deliver advance care planning and counseling to patients and caregivers to document preferences if a life-threatening event or medical crisis occurs.

Provide non-emergent care to residents in long-term care facilities.

Provide education and training for HCP through peer-to-peer professional medical consultations (inpatient or outpatient) that is not locally available, particularly in rural areas.

Tips for using telehealth services to screen and care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19

Instruct patients who think they may have COVID-19 to use available advice lines, patient portals, or on-line self-assessment tools or to call and speak to an office/clinic staff rather than coming in person.

Identify staff to conduct telephonic and telehealth interactions with patients. Develop protocols for staff to triage and assess patients quickly.

Determine algorithms to identify which patients can be managed by telephone and advised to stay home, and which patients will need to be sent for emergency care, come for in-person visits, or follow up with a lab for COVID-19 diagnostic testing (or other testing services).

Instruct patients with symptoms of COVID-19 to call before they leave home so staff can be prepared to care for them when they arrive.

Using Telehealth to Expand Access to Essential Health Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Purpose of this Guidance To describe the landscape of telehealth services and provide considerations for healthcare systems, practices, and providers using telehealth services to provide virtual care during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

Background

Changes in the way that health care is delivered during this pandemic are needed to reduce staff exposure to ill persons, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and minimize the impact of patient surges on facilities. Healthcare systems have had to adjust the way they triage, evaluate, and care for patients using methods that do not rely on in-person services. Telehealth services help provide necessary care to patients while minimizing the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to healthcare personnel (HCP) and patients.

While telehealth technology and its use are not new, widespread adoption among HCP and patients beyond simple telephone correspondence has been relatively slow.1,2 Before the COVID-19 pandemic, trends show some increased interest in use of telehealth services by both HCP and patients.3,4,5 However, recent policy changes during the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced barriers to telehealth access and have promoted the use of telehealth as a way to deliver acute, chronic, primary and specialty care.6 Many professional medical societies endorse telehealth services and provide guidance for medical practice in this evolving landscape.7,8,9 Telehealth can also improve patient health outcomes.10

Telehealth Modalities

Several telehealth modalities allow HCP and patients to connect using technology to deliver health care:

Synchronous : This includes real-time telephone or live audio-video interaction typically with a patient using a smartphone, tablet, or computer. In some cases, peripheral medical equipment (e.g., digital stethoscopes, otoscopes, ultrasounds) can be used by another HCP (e.g., nurse, medical assistant) physically with the patient, while the consulting medical provider conducts a remote evaluation.

: This includes real-time telephone or live audio-video interaction typically with a patient using a smartphone, tablet, or computer. Asynchronous: This includes “store and forward” technology where messages, images, or data are collected at one point in time and interpreted or responded to later. Patient portals can facilitate this type of communication between provider and patient through secure messaging.

Remote patient monitoring: This allows direct transmission of a patient’s clinical measurements from a distance (may or may not be in real time) to their healthcare provider.

Benefits and Potential Uses of Telehealth

Telehealth services can facilitate public health mitigation strategies during this pandemic by increasing social distancing. These services can be a safer option for HCP and patients by reducing potential infectious exposures. They can reduce the strain on healthcare systems by minimizing the surge of patient demand on facilities and reduce the use of PPE by healthcare providers.

Maintaining continuity of care to the extent possible can avoid additional negative consequences from delayed preventive, chronic, or routine care. Remote access to healthcare services may increase participation for those who are medically or socially vulnerable or who do not have ready access to providers. Remote access can also help preserve the patient-provider relationship at times when an in-person visit is not practical or feasible. Telehealth services can be used to:

Screen patients who may have symptoms of COVID-19 and refer as appropriate

Provide low-risk urgent care for non-COVID-19 conditions, identify those persons who may need additional medical consultation or assessment, and refer as appropriate

Access primary care providers and specialists, including mental and behavioral health, for chronic health conditions and medication management

Provide coaching and support for patients managing chronic health conditions, including weight management and nutrition counseling

Participate in physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other modalities as a hybrid approach to in-person care for optimal health

Monitor clinical signs of certain chronic medical conditions (e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose, other remote assessments)

Engage in case management for patients who have difficulty accessing care (e.g., those who live in very rural settings, older adults, those with limited mobility)

Follow up with patients after hospitalization

Deliver advance care planning and counseling to patients and caregivers to document preferences if a life-threatening event or medical crisis occurs

Provide non-emergent care to residents in long-term care facilities

Provide education and training for HCP through peer-to-peer professional medical consultations (inpatient or outpatient) that are not locally available, particularly in rural areas

Strategies to Increase Telehealth Uptake

Promote and optimize the use of telehealth services for the safety of HCP and patients while using the Framework for Healthcare Systems Providing Non-COVID-19 Clinical Care to determine when in-person care is appropriate. Include options for language interpretation, as needed.

Communicate with insurers/payers to understand availability of covered telehealth, telemedicine, or nurse advice line services

Use tele-triage methods for assessing and caring for all patients to decrease the volume of persons seeking care in facilities, especially during times of high transmission of contagious diseases such as COVID-19

Provide outreach to patients with limited technology and connectivity and offer flexibility in platforms that can be used for video consultation, or non-video options, when possible

Telehealth Reimbursement

Insurance payers and HCP professional associations have supported the transition to telehealth services during the pandemic. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued multiple waiverspdf iconexternal icon, providing flexibility (e.g., geographic location, type of health site) during the pandemic and granting payment parity between telehealth and in-person clinical care for Medicare.11 Medicaid programsexternal icon are administered at the state level and states can choose whether or not to cover telehealth services as an alternative to traditional in-person methods of care.

Safeguards for Telehealth Services

Understand individual federal and state regulations and restrictions, temporary mandates and directives, and expiration dates Monitor for updated regulatory actions for healthcare systems and HCP Regional systems that provide services in multiple states must be particularly attentive to individual state requirements HCP should track eligibility criteria based on their specific profession

Maintain awareness of the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announcements related to HIPAA and COVID-19 external icon

Train providers and staff on policies, practices, and protocols for using telehealth services, including appointment scheduling, documentation and billing, referral processes for specialty care, urgent and emergent care, laboratory services, pharmacy prescriptions, medical equipment, and follow-up visits

Explore the use of telehealth services in all parts of the healthcare delivery system including FQHCs (federally qualified health centers) external icon , community clinics, pharmacies, and school-based health centers external icon

Potential Limitations of Telehealth

Interstate licensure challenges and other regulatory issues that may vary by state

Situations in which in-person visits are more appropriate due to urgency, underlying health conditions, or inability to perform an adequate physical exam

The need to address sensitive topics, especially if there is patient discomfort or concern for privacy

Limited access to technological devices (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer) needed for a telehealth visit or connectivity issues

Level of comfort with technology for HCP and patients

Cultural acceptance of conducting virtual visits in lieu of in-person visits by HCP and patients

Non-COVID-19 Care Framework,"Purpose

To provide healthcare systems with a framework to deliver non-COVID-19 health care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Background

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommended that healthcare systems prioritize urgent visits and delay elective care to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings. A consequence of the pandemic has been the under-utilization of important medical services for patients with non-COVID-19-related urgent and emergent health needs [1-3]. As the pandemic continues, healthcare systems must balance the need to provide necessary services while minimizing risk to patients and healthcare personnel (HCP). Because the effects of COVID-19 vary among communities, healthcare systems will also need to consider the local level of COVID-19 transmission when making decisions about the provision of medical services. This document provides a framework for the delivery of non-COVID clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, considerations may change over time and vary by practice type and setting.

Key considerations

The following table provides a framework for considering some of these factors. The examples are not exhaustive; decisions that healthcare systems ultimately make may depend on local factors not addressed in this table.

Table. Framework for provision of non-COVID-19 health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, by potential for patient harm and degree of community transmission

Framework for provision of non-COVID-19 health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, by potential for patient harm and degree of community transmission Potential for patient harm Examples Substantial community transmission

Large scale community transmission, including communal settings (e.g., schools, workplaces) Minimal to moderate community transmission

Sustained transmission with high likelihood or confirmed exposure within communal settings and potential for rapid increase in cases No to minimal community transmission

Evidence of isolated cases or limited community transmission, case investigations underway; no evidence of exposure in large communal setting Highly likely

Deferral of in-person care highly likely to result in patient harm Signs/symptoms of stroke or heart attack

Dental emergencies

Acute abdominal pain

Treatment for certain cancer diagnoses

Well-child visits for newborns Provide care without delay; consider if feasible to shift care to facilities less heavily affected by COVID-19. Provide care without delay; consider if your facility can provide the patient’s care, rather than transferring them to a facility less affected by COVID-19. Provide care without delay while resuming regular care practices. Less likely

Deferral of in-person care may result in patient harm Pediatric vaccinations

Change in symptoms for chronic conditions

Musculoskeletal injury

Certain planned surgical repairs

Physical or occupational therapy If care cannot be delivered remotely, arrange for in-person care as soon as feasible with priority for at-risk* populations. Utilize telehealth if appropriate. If care cannot be delivered remotely, work towards expanding in-person care to all patients in this category. Utilize telehealth if appropriate. Resume regular care practices while continuing to utilize telehealth if appropriate. Unlikely

Deferral of in-person care unlikely to result in patient harm

Routine primary or specialty care

Care for well-controlled chronic conditions

Routine screening for asymptomatic conditions

Most elective surgeries and procedures If care cannot be delivered remotely, consider deferring until community transmission decreases. Utilize telehealth if appropriate. If care cannot be delivered remotely, work towards expanding in-person care as needed with priority for at-risk* populations and those whose care, if continually deferred, would more likely result in patient harm. Utilize telehealth if appropriate. Resume regular care practices while continuing to utilize telehealth if appropriate.

COVID-19 Surge,"COVID-19Surge is a spreadsheet-based tool that hospital administrators and public health officials can use to estimate the surge in demand for hospital-based services during the COVID-19 pandemic. A user of COVID-19Surge can produce estimates of the number of COVID-19 patients that need to be hospitalized, the number requiring ICU care, and the number requiring ventilator support. The user can then compare those estimates with hospital capacity, using either existing capacity or estimates of expanded capacity.

With COVID-19Surge, users define the population in the hospital “catchment area” or local jurisdiction. The user also enters the number of cases to date, and the available hospital resources (non-ICU beds, ICU beds, and mechanical ventilators). Users can assess up to three community mitigation strategies simultaneously and compare the impacts on hospital resources versus a “no intervention” scenario.

FAQ

Can COVID-19Surge be used to accurately estimate the impact of COVID-19?

The numbers generated through COVID-19Surge are estimates. They DO NOT reflect what will actually occur during the pandemic. Rather, they are estimates for a given set of scenarios. COVID-19Surge should be used to plan and prepare a response to a surge in demand for hospital-based resources due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Can users change the input variables?

Yes. When you download and open the COVID-19Surge, all inputs are pre-populated with numbers and estimates based on published sources. Users can change the values in the tool that best illustrate the situation in their jurisdiction. Further, we encourage users to change input values and explore the impact of various scenarios. Explanations are provided in the accompanying manual.

System Requirements

COVID-19Surge uses the Windows* operating system (Microsoft Windows 2010 or higher) and Excel (Microsoft Office 2013 or higher). The full functionality of COVID-19Surge is supported in the desktop version of Microsoft Office® for Windows. Some functionality may not be available in Microsoft Office for Macs or in the browser version of Office 365.

Hospital Preparedness Checklist: 2019-nCoV,"Planning for community spread of COVID-19 is critical for maintaining healthcare services during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. All U.S. hospitals should be prepared for the possible arrival of patients with COVID-19. All hospitals should ensure their staff are trained, equipped and capable of practices needed to:

Prevent the spread of respiratory diseases including COVID-19 within the facility

Promptly identify and isolate patients with possible COVID-19 and inform the correct facility staff and public health authorities

Care for a limited number of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 as part of routine operations

Potentially care for a larger number of patients in the context of an escalating outbreak while maintaining adequate care for other patients

Monitor and manage any healthcare personnel that might be exposed to COVID-19

Communicate effectively within the facility and plan for appropriate external communication related to COVID-19

The following checklist can help hospitals assess and improve their preparedness for responding to a community-wide outbreak of COVID-19. Each hospital will need to adapt this checklist to meet its unique needs and circumstances. This checklist should be used as one of several tools for evaluating current plans or in developing a comprehensive COVID-19 preparedness plan.

Strategies to Mitigate Healthcare Personnel Staffing Shortages,"Maintaining appropriate staffing in healthcare facilities is essential to providing a safe work environment for healthcare personnel (HCP) and safe patient care. As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, staffing shortages will likely occur due to HCP exposures, illness, or need to care for family members at home. Healthcare facilities must be prepared for potential staffing shortages and have plans and processes in place to mitigate these, including communicating with HCP about actions the facility is taking to address shortages and maintain patient and HCP safety and providing resources to assist HCP with anxiety and stress.

There are Contingency and Crisis Capacity Strategies that healthcare facilities should consider in these situations. For example, if, despite efforts to mitigate, HCP staffing shortages occur, healthcare systems, facilities, and the appropriate state, local, territorial, and/or tribal health authorities might determine that HCP with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 could return to work before the full Return to Work Criteria have been met. Several of the Crisis Capacity Strategies are dependent on HCP wearing a facemask for source control while at work. Given ongoing shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), facilities should refer to and implement relevant Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.

Contingency Capacity Strategies to Mitigate Staffing Shortages

When staffing shortages are anticipated, healthcare facilities and employers, in collaboration with human resources and occupational health services, should use contingency capacity strategies to plan and prepare for mitigating this problem. At baseline, healthcare facilities must:

Understand their staffing needs and the minimum number of staff needed to provide a safe work environment and safe patient care.

Be in communication with local healthcare coalitions, federal, state, and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) to identify additional HCP (e.g., hiring additional HCP, recruiting retired HCP, using students or volunteers), when needed.

Contingency capacity strategies for healthcare facilities include:

Adjusting staff schedules, hiring additional HCP, and rotating HCP to positions that support patient care activities.

Cancel all non-essential procedures and visits. Shift HCP who work in these areas to support other patient care activities in the facility. Facilities will need to ensure these HCP have received appropriate orientation and training to work in these areas that are new to them.

Attempt to address social factors that might prevent HCP from reporting to work such as need for transportation or housing that allows for social distancing, particularly if HCP live with individuals with underlying medical conditions or older adults. Consider that these social factors disproportionately affect persons from racial and ethnic groups also disproportionally affected by COVID-19 (e.g., African Americans, Hispanics and Latinos, and American Indians and Alaska Natives).

Identify additional HCP to work in the facility. Be aware of state-specific emergency waivers or changes to licensure requirements or renewals for select categories of HCP.

As appropriate, request that HCP postpone elective time off from work. However, there should consideration for the mental health benefits of time off and that the burden of the disease and care-taking responsibilities may differ substantially among certain racial and ethnic groups.

Developing regional plans to identify designated healthcare facilities or alternate care sites with adequate staffing to care for patients with COVID-19.

Developing plans to allow asymptomatic HCP who have had an unprotected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) but are not known to be infected to continue to work.

These HCP should still report temperature and absence of symptoms each day before starting work.

These HCP should wear a facemask (for source control) while at work for 14 days (this is the time period during which exposed HCP might develop symptoms, i.e., the current incubation period for the virus) after the exposure event. A facemask instead of a cloth face covering should be used by these HCP for source control during this time period while in the facility. After this time period, these HCP should revert to their facility policy regarding universal source control during the pandemic. A facemask for source control does not replace the need to wear an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator (or other PPE) when indicated, including for the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.



When testing is readily available, performing post-exposure testing during the 14-day post-exposure period can be considered to more quickly identify pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic HCP who could contribute to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Facilities that elect to perform post-exposure testing of HCP should be aware that testing might be logistically challenging and has limitations. For example, testing only identifies the presence of virus at the time of the test. It is possible that HCP can test negative because they are very early in their infection when their sample is collected. In such situations, they could become infectious later and transmit the virus to others; for this reason, repeat testing could be considered. Also, when there is SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurring in the community, positive tests in HCP do not necessarily indicate transmission due to exposures in the workplace. If testing of exposed HCP is instituted, test results should be available rapidly (i.e., within 24 hours), and there should be a clear plan to respond to results.



If HCP develop even mild symptoms consistent with COVID-19, they must cease patient care activities and notify their supervisor or occupational health services prior to leaving work. These individuals should be prioritized for testing.

If HCP are tested and found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, they should be excluded from work until they meet all Return to Work Criteria. HCP with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should be prioritized for testing, as testing results will impact when they may return to work and for which patients they might be permitted to provide care.

Developing criteria to determine which HCP with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (who are well enough and willing to work) could return to work in a healthcare setting before meeting all Return to Work Criteria—if staff shortages continue despite other mitigation strategies.

Considerations include: The type of HCP shortages that need to be addressed. Where individual HCP are in the course of their illness (e.g., viral shedding appears to be higher earlier in the course of illness). The types of symptoms they are experiencing (e.g., persistent fever). Their degree of interaction with patients and other HCP in the facility. For example, are they working in telemedicine services, providing direct patient care, or working in a satellite unit reprocessing medical equipment? The type of patients they care for (e.g., immunocompromised patients or only patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection).

As part of planning, healthcare facilities (in collaboration with risk management) should inform patients and HCP when the facility is operating under crisis standards, the changes in practice that should be expected, and actions that will be taken to protect them from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 if HCP with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are allowed to work.

Crisis Capacity Strategies to Mitigate Staffing Shortages

When staffing shortages are occurring, healthcare facilities and employers (in collaboration with human resources and occupational health services) may need to implement crisis capacity strategies to continue to provide patient care.

† These estimates are based on age-specific estimates of infection fatality ratios from Hauser, A., Counotte, M.J., Margossian, C.C., Konstantinoudis, G., Low, N., Althaus, C.L. and Riou, J., 2020. Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 mortality during the early stages of an epidemic: a modeling study in Hubei, China, and six regions in Europe. PLoS medicine, 17(7), p.e1003189. Hauser et al. produced estimates of IFR for 10-year age bands from 0 to 80+ year old for 6 regions in Europe. Estimates exclude infection fatality ratios from Hubei, China, because we assumed infection and case ascertainment from the 6 European regions are more likely to reflect ascertainment in the U.S. To obtain the best estimate values, the point estimates of IFR by age were averaged to broader age groups for each of the 6 European regions using weights based on the age distribution of reported cases from COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data (https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). The estimates for persons ≥70 years old presented here do not include persons ≥80 years old as IFR estimates from Hauser et al., assumed that 100% of infections among persons ≥80 years old were reported. The consolidated age estimates were then averaged across the 6 European regions. The lower bound estimate is the lowest, non-zero point estimate across the six regions, while the upper bound is the highest point estimate across the six regions.

§ The percent of cases that are asymptomatic, i.e. never experience symptoms, remains uncertain. Longitudinal testing of individuals is required to accurately detect the absence of symptoms for the full period of infectiousness. Current peer-reviewed and preprint studies vary widely in follow-up times for re-testing, or do not include re-testing of cases. Additionally, studies vary in the definition of a symptomatic case, which makes it difficult to make direct comparisons between estimates. Furthermore, the percent of cases that are asymptomatic may vary by age, and the age groups reported in studies vary. Given these limitations, the range of estimates for Scenarios 1-4 is wide. The lower bound estimate approximates the lower 95% confidence interval bound estimated from: Byambasuren, O., Cardona, M., Bell, K., Clark, J., McLaws, M. L., & Glasziou, P. (2020). Estimating the extent of true asymptomatic COVID-19 and its potential for community transmission: systematic review and meta-analysis. Available at SSRN 3586675. The upper bound estimate approximates the upper 95% confidence interval bound estimated from: Poletti, P., Tirani, M., Cereda, D., Trentini, F., Guzzetta, G., Sabatino, G., Marziano, V., Castrofino, A., Grosso, F., Del Castillo, G. and Piccarreta, R. (2020). Probability of symptoms and critical disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.08471. The best estimate is the midpoint of this range and aligns with estimates from: Oran DP, Topol EJ. Prevalence of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Narrative Review [published online ahead of print, 2020 Jun 3]. Ann Intern Med. 2020; M20-3012.

¶ The current best estimate is based on multiple assumptions. The relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases to symptomatic cases remains highly uncertain, as asymptomatic cases are difficult to identify, and transmission is difficult to observe and quantify. The estimates for relative infectiousness are assumptions based on studies of viral shedding dynamics.

Key Considerations for Transferring Patients to Relief Healthcare Facilities when Responding to Community Transmission of COVID-19 in the United States,"Key Terms

Relief Healthcare Facilities (RHFs): Established licensed healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, and other licensed inpatient healthcare facilities) that accept patient transfers or share extra resources to extend conventional standards of care to as many people as possible during a crisis and therefore minimize the use of crisis standards of care.

Crisis Standards of Care: Standards of care that reflect a substantial change in usual healthcare operations and the level of care that healthcare providers are capable of delivering during a crisis. When a state government formally declares the need for crisis standards of care, this formal declaration enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for healthcare providers as they perform the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources and adopting alternate healthcare operations during a crisis.

Medical Operations Coordination Cell (MOCC): A cell (group of medical operations experts) within emergency operations centers (EOCs) at the sub-state regional, state-wide, and federal regional levels that can assist in the transferring of patients between healthcare facilities. A MOCC makes data-and stakeholder-informed decisions to balance patient load and ensure high-quality care. MOCC decisions direct the movement of patients and resources from one facility to another or re-direct referrals of patients who would usually go to an overwhelmed facility or system to one that has the capacity to care for those patients.

Why This Guidance Is Needed

Many COVID-19 cases are geographically localized and can overwhelm local healthcare facilities. This means that healthcare systems typically have uneven distribution of COVID-19 cases, with some regions’ healthcare systems experiencing patient surges while others have excess capacity for patient care. When healthcare facilities reach or exceed patient capacity, crisis standards of careexternal icon are often implemented. Healthcare systems entering crisis standards of care are faced with the tremendous challenge of providing high-quality care while allocating scarce resources.

Who This Guidance Is For

This guidance is for state and local emergency medical planners and all healthcare facilities, especially facilities in rural areas. This guidance outlines considerations around the transfer of patients, staff, and supplies between healthcare facilities to optimize patient care, balance resources, and minimize use of crisis care standards. One strategy is to identify relief healthcare facilities and either establish a federal, state, or regional Medical Operation Coordination Cell (MOCC) or coordinate with an existing MOCC. This guidance offers considerations for jurisdictions around patient safety and relief healthcare facility operations. Specific guidance related to the implementation of the elements highlighted in this guidance can be found in the Federal MOCC Toolkitpdf iconexternal icon.

Key Considerations for States

Many states and regions have drawn upon years of experience responding to past public health emergencies as they coordinate healthcare, public health, and emergency medical systems in response to COVID-19. One advantage of a coordinated approach is monitoring for resource-straining surges of patients and identifying facilities with available beds, staff, and supplies.

To optimize care for patients, some states designate facilities with available beds and staff as relief healthcare facilities (RHFs). RHFs are established licensed healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, and other licensed inpatient healthcare facilities) that accept patient transfers or share extra resources to extend conventional standards of care to as many people as possible during a crisis and therefore minimize the use of crisis standards of care.

The Federal Medical Operations Coordination Cells (MOCCs) Toolkitpdf iconexternal icon offers flexible guidance to help regional, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments improve surge capacity and resource allocation across the healthcare delivery system during the COVID-19 pandemic.1,2> The toolkit provides a framework for states or local jurisdictions to establish RHFs. The primary goals for states identifying RHFs are:

Providing the appropriate level of medical care.

Protecting healthcare personnel and non-COVID-19 patients from infection.

Preparing for a potential surge in patients with respiratory infection.

Preparing for shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and staffing.

Elements Needed for Use of Relief Healthcare Facilities

The following guidance is for state and local emergency medical planners and all healthcare facilities, especially facilities in rural areas, planning to identify RHFs, establish a MOCC, or coordinate with an existing MOCC. Guidance, tools, and resources for many of these factors can be found in the MOCC toolkitpdf iconexternal icon.

Regional Coordination

Centralized decision-making must occur at the regional, state, or health system level. Work with MOCCs pdf icon external icon , 1 ,2 local and state public health organizations, healthcare coalitions, and other local partners to understand the impact and spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in your area and any modifications in ongoing initiatives being implemented. Ensure that emergency medical service (EMS) agency licensure and resource capabilities are included in local and regional planning efforts. Identify ground and aeromedical transport assets to support patient transfers and develop processes for interfacility transport. If RHFs are to be used across state lines, the healthcare systems and both states should be engaged for joint planning. Develop plans to ensure closed healthcare facilities near RHFs can rapidly and safely re-open if there is a patient surge in surrounding areas.

Patients suitable for transfer should have their information entered into a central, secure database for tracking, triage, and placement. Communicate information about patients to appropriate personnel before transferring them to another healthcare facility. MOCCs and coordinating healthcare facilities should ensure healthcare expenditures will be appropriately covered before transferring patients. 3 ,4,5,6

Accepting facilities should review and accept patients based on: the RHF’s ability to provide appropriate standards of care; distance from the patient’s current healthcare facility; and the patient’s level of clinical stability.

PPE and personnel should be tracked in a centralized system: Centralized decision makers should review regularly the HHS Protect Hospital Capacity Data external icon dashboard, data from long-term care facilities reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), and other data sources to ensure that patients and ventilators are placed appropriately and that accepting facilities can manage increases in patient volume.



Relief Healthcare Facility Resources and Capacity

Ensure that RHFs have all legal documentation and infrastructural requirement needed to rapidly re-open, if closed.

Ensure that RHFs have an adequate number of trained healthcare professionals, sufficient space to accommodate additional patients, appropriate PPE, and other equipment and supplies to care for these patients. RHFs must be able to accept transfers from highly impacted hospitals and other healthcare facilities without compromising their ability to respond to surges in their own communities. Relief hospitals must be able to provide: a critical care bed for a patient with COVID-19 requiring critical care, including mechanical ventilation; a critical care bed for a patient without COVID-19 requiring critical care, including mechanical ventilation; a non-critical care bed for a patient with COVID-19; a non-critical care bed for a patient without COVID-19; and a swing bed for long-term recovery, if relief hospitals lack critical care capacity. Some rural facilities may have limited capacity to accommodate clinically complex patients and may be more appropriate for non-critical patient care or care of patients without COVID-19. Relief hospitals must be able to provide critical care capability on site if they are accepting patients with a high risk of decompensation who may need to be transferred to higher levels of care if their condition deteriorates quickly. 1 Relief skilled nursing homes should declare their willingness to accept both patients with and without COVID-19 and their willingness to accept stable patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation and considered appropriate for skilled nursing home level of care. 2 , 3 Relief long-term care facilities should be willing to accept stable patients requiring mechanical ventilation considered appropriate for long-term care.

Ensure RHFs use strategies to ensure workers’ safety and support, including healthcare personnel monitoring and operational planning.

Ensure healthcare facilities, including RHFs and other facilities treating patients with COVID-19, submit capacity data to HHS Protect using one of the approved mechanisms described in the HHS COVID-19 Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQs external icon .

. Consider if cohorting patients and healthcare personnel may be feasible or useful (i.e., entire facilities or units for patients with COVID-19 or non-COVID-19), including post-discharge planning for patients who are going from hospitals to long-term care or other types of healthcare facilities.

Ensure all RHFs are prepared to safely triage and manage patients with respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Ensure they become familiar with infection prevention and control guidance for managing patients with COVID-19 and preparation steps.

Ensure RHFs plan to optimize the supply of PPE in the event of shortages and identify flexible mechanisms to procure additional supplies when needed.

Interfacility and Patient Communication

All planning efforts for RHFs should adhere to regulations and standards for informed consent external icon regarding patient transfers between facilities. The MOCC toolkit provides informed consent form templates.

regarding patient transfers between facilities. The MOCC toolkit provides informed consent form templates. Consider whether and what legal documentation may be necessary to facilitate patient transfers.

Ensure communication between healthcare professionals at the transferring and receiving facilities, with an accurate clinical description of the patients and with clear acceptance by the RHF.

Telehealth consults with the RHFs should be considered, as needed, for patient management. 10

The receiving facility’s policies on visitors should be communicated to family members and healthcare powers of attorney.

SPOTLIGHT: Texas implements a Regional Medical Operations Coordinating Center

Texas used the existing regional trauma system as a stable framework for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Texas further strengthened this framework and response efforts by linking existing public health, acute healthcare, and disaster management systems to MOCCs. The state’s experience demonstrates the benefits of having established systems for public health and disaster response.

Accelerated Problem-Solving

Texas’s system enabled and facilitated timely action by:

Structuring cooperation across the state.

Supporting robust and redundant communications.

Delivering actionable data.

Building on this existing response framework, Texas implemented performance improvement processes to adapt the system to the response and achieve the best patient outcomes.

The Role of Regional MOCCs

The Regional MOCC bolstered the framework created by Texas’s trauma system by:

Providing situational awareness.

Supporting integration of public health, acute health care, and disaster management functions.

Providing actionable data from consolidating public health and acute health care data sources.

Coordinating healthcare delivery in hot spots.

Managing drive-through testing.

Balancing staff workload across health systems and organizations.

Ensuring safe and high-quality patient care by transferring within the system where care was optimal.

SPOTLIGHT: Michigan’s response to extreme surge in southeast regions

In mid-March, Michigan began to experience a significant spread of COVID-19 in the southeast region and metropolitan Detroit area – with peak hospitalizations of greater than 4,400. The Michigan Healthcare Preparedness Program quickly put into place a surge strategy that optimized the use of healthcare resources to save lives. A key piece of this strategy was using relief hospitals to extend healthcare to residents in need. Although Michigan encountered staff recruitment challenges for hospitals in minimally impacted regions, willingness of these hospitals to accept patients improved following requests from senior state leadership to hospital chief executive officers. The state’s experience demonstrates the importance of monitoring statewide hospital status and facilitating direct connections between hospitals.

Extending Conventional Standards of Care

Michigan was able to implement the relief hospital concept using the following effective strategies:

During a 20-day period (April 1–20, 2020), nearly 1,000 patients were transferred between hospitals. About 85% of these patients were transferred through direct interhospital contact, and about 30% were transferred within healthcare systems.

The Role of Regional and State MOCCs

Michigan prioritized a facilitative role by establishing and supporting:

A state MOCC operated by experienced paramedics in an EMS dispatch control center.

Physician resources for consultation, problem-solving, and medical leadership.

A statewide hospital status application, was an invaluable tool for identifying relief hospitals and facilitating transfers.

COVID-19 Overview and Infection Prevention and Control Priorities in non-US Healthcare Settings,"Purpose and Scope of this document This overview was created for healthcare workers in non-US healthcare settings and government officials working on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response. The information in this document draws from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidance documents and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) priorities for the response to COVID-19 in healthcare settings and includes information that can be used in non-US contexts.

Structure of the document

This overview is organized by first presenting a background on coronaviruses and then briefly describes the emergence, transmission, symptoms, prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The rest of the document reviews COVID-19 IPC priorities, in non-US healthcare settings.

Coronavirus Background:

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illness in animals or humans. In humans there are several known coronaviruses that cause respiratory infections. These coronaviruses range from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19.

Coronavirus Disease 2019:

Emergence

COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID-19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person. Early in the outbreak, many patients were reported to have a link to a large seafood and live animal market, however, later cases with no link to the market confirmed person-to-person transmission of the disease. Additionally, travel-related exportation of cases has occurred.

Transmission

COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. These droplets are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks. Infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. A physical distance of at least 1 meter (3 ft) between persons is suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid infection, although some WHO member states have recommended maintaining greater distances whenever possible1. Respiratory droplets can land on hands, objects or surfaces around the person when they cough or talk, and people can then become infected with COVID-19 from touching hands, objects or surfaces with droplets and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Recent data suggest that there can be transmission of COVID-19 through droplets of those with mild symptoms or those who do not feel ill2. Current data do not support long range aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, such as seen with measles or tuberculosis. Short-range inhalation of aerosols is a possibility for COVID-19, as with many respiratory pathogens. However, this cannot easily be distinguished from “droplet” transmission based on epidemiologic patterns. Short-range transmission is a possibility particularly in crowded medical wards and inadequately ventilated spaces3. Certain procedures in health facilities can generate fine aerosols and should be avoided whenever possible.

Symptoms

A wide range of symptoms for COVID-19 have been reported4. These include:

Fever or chills

Cough

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Fatigue

Headache

Nasal congestion or runny nose

Muscle or body aches

Sore throat

New loss of smell or taste

Nausea or vomiting

Diarrhea

The estimated incubation period is between 2 and 14 days with a median of 5 days. It is important to note that some people become infected and do not develop any symptoms or feel unwell.

Despite the important concerns about case fatality rates, most COVID-19 illnesses are – and we expect will continue to be – mild, and most patients will recover spontaneously with some supportive care, especially children and young adults. Data from several countries suggest that 14%-19% are hospitalized and 3%-5% will need intense care unit admission.

The first largest description of patients with COVID-19 came from China, where the outbreak of COVID-19 started, and is described in detail below. Among the 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported from December 31, 2019 through February 11, 2020, the clinical presentation was as follow:

Mild (non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases) represented 80.9% of confirmed patients with COVID-19 in China.

NOTE: These cases included a large spectrum of illnesses including but not limited to patients having fever, cough, chest pain, nausea, and body pain. Severe (dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min, blood O 2 sat ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, lung infiltrates >50% within 24–48 hours) represented 13.8% of confirmed patients with COVID-19 in China.

Critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure, death) represented 4.7% of confirmed patients with COVID-19 in China. 1,023 (49%) deaths were reported among the 2,087 critically ill patients.

People at Higher Risk for Severe Illness

It is important to note that COVID-19 is a new disease, therefore there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. In some cases, people who get COVID-19 can become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing. These severe complications can lead to death. The risk of severe disease increases steadily as people age. Additionally, those of all ages with underlying medical conditions (including but not limited to heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease) appear to be at higher risk in developing severe COVID-19 compared to those without these conditions. As more data become available, additional risk factors for severe COVID-19 may be identified.

COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment

COVID-19: Everyday Preventive Actions

There are a number of ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection. These include:

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth

Avoid close contact with people who are sick Remember that some people without symptoms can still spread the virus

Stay at home when you are sick

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then dispose of it properly

Use a face covering when physical distancing is difficult or when going into closed spaces 8 Physical distancing should be at least 1 meter (3 ft)

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces

Perform hand hygiene with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand rub Hand Rub should contain at least 60% alcohol 9 Hand washing should be done for at least 40-60 seconds based on WHO’s recommendations



COVID-19: Treatment

Currently, care for patients with COVID-19 is primarily supportive. Care is given to patients to help relieve symptoms and manage respiratory and other organ failure. There are currently no specific antiviral treatments licensed for COVID-19, however many treatments are under investigation. Remdesivir, which is also an investigational drug, received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization for treatment of hospitalized patients. Finally, no vaccine is currently available.

IPC for COVID-19

What is IPC?

Infection prevention and control (IPC) is the practice of preventing or stopping the spread of infections during healthcare delivery in facilities like hospitals, outpatient clinics, dialysis centers, long-term care facilities, or traditional practitioners. IPC is a critical part of health system strengthening and must be a priority to protect patients and healthcare workers. In the context of COVID-19, the IPC goal is to support the maintenance of essential healthcare services by containing and preventing COVID-19 transmission within healthcare facilities to keep patients and healthcare workers healthy and safe.

COVID-19: IPC Priorities

Rapid identification of suspect cases Screening/Triage at initial healthcare facility encounter and rapid implementation of source control Limiting the entry of healthcare workers and/or visitors with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 Immediate isolation and referral for testing Group patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 separately Test all suspected patients for COVID-19 Safe clinical management Immediate identification of inpatients and healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Adherence to IPC practices Appropriate use of Personal protective equipment (PPE)

More detailed information regarding the IPC priorities for non-US healthcare settings can be found in the Strategic Priority IPC Activities for Containment and Prevention document.

Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions

Standard Precautions are a set of practices that apply to the care of patients in all healthcare settings at all times. Standard precautions remain the cornerstone of infection prevention. Application of these precautions depends on the nature of the health worker-patient interaction and the anticipated exposure to a known infectious agent. Standard precautions include:

Hand hygiene

Personal protective equipment

Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette

Cleaning and disinfection of devices and environmental surfaces

Safe injection practices

Medication storage and handling

Transmission-based precautions are a set of practices specific for patients with known or suspected infectious agents that require additional control measures to prevent transmission. These precautions are used in addition to standard precautions.

Current WHO guidance for healthcare workers caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions in addition to standard precautions (unless an aerosol generated procedure is being performed, in which case airborne precautions are needed)1. Disposable or dedicated patient care equipment (e.g., stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs) should be used; however, if equipment needs to be shared among patients, then it should be cleaned and disinfected between use for each patient (ethyl alcohol of at least 70%).

Additionally, adequately ventilated single rooms or wards are suggested. For general ward rooms with natural ventilation, adequate ventilation for COVID-19 patients is considered to be 60 L/s per patient. When single rooms are not available, suspected COVID-19 patients should be grouped together with beds at least 1 meter (3ft) apart based on WHO’s recommendation, although some member states have recommended maintaining greater distances whenever possible. COVID-19 isolation rooms or wards should have dedicated bathrooms, which should be cleaned and disinfected at least twice daily.

Additionally, healthcare facilities can also consider designating healthcare workers to care for patients with COVID-19 and restrict the number of visitors allowed in the facility.

Transportation of patients with COVID-19 should be avoided unless medically necessary. If a patient is deemed medically necessary to be transported, a mask should be placed on the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient. Healthcare workers should also wear the appropriate PPE when transporting patients.

COVID-19: PPE

Contact and droplet precaution PPE are recommended for healthcare workers before entering the room of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Healthcare workers should be trained on the correct use of PPE, including how to put on and remove PPE. Extended use and re-use of certain PPE items such as masks and gowns can be considered when there are supply shortages. Additional guidance can be located under Emergency Considerations for PPE. Healthcare workers should:

Use a medical mask (i.e., at least a surgical/medical mask)

Wear eye protection (goggles) or facial protection (face shield)

Wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown

Use gloves

There is a higher risk of self-contamination when removing PPE. Please see instructions for putting on and removing PPEpdf icon for guidance.

For healthcare workers performing any of the following aerosol generating procedures on patients with COVID-19, it is recommended that a fitted respirator mask (N95 respirators, FFP2 or equivalent) is used as opposed to surgical/medical masks. In addition to wearing a fitted respirator mask, healthcare workers should also wear appropriate PPE including gloves, a gown and eye protection.

Aerosol Generating Procedures include1:

Endotracheal intubation

Bronchoscopy

Non-invasive ventilation

Tracheotomy

Manual ventilation before intubation

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

Sputum induction

Autopsy procedures

Strategic Priority Infection Prevention and Control Activities for Non-US Healthcare Settings,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working closely with international partners to respond to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CDC provides technical assistance to help other countries increase their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats, including COVID-19. This document is provided by CDC and is intended for use in non-US healthcare settings.

1. Use of this document

This document is intended to guide national-level coordination, healthcare facilities, and implementing partners in considering and planning high-priority IPC activities to prevent healthcare-associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus). Aspects of this document are relevant for all countries, but a focus is placed on priorities for low- and middle-income settings given resource constraints.

The goal of IPC activities in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) response is to support the maintenance of essential healthcare services by preventing healthcare-associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers (HCW) and patients.

This requires:

Rapid identification of suspect cases

Immediate isolation and referral for testing

Safe clinical management

Adherence to standard IPC precautions

This document focuses on implementation of rapid identification of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities, which forms the basis for subsequent isolation, testing and management decisions.

Planning and coordination of activities should be conducted in collaboration with emergency response officials, in addition to relevant public health officials (e.g., Ministry of Health, sub-national health offices, facility administration).

This document addresses specific details on prioritized activities around rapid identification of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities under four different epidemiological scenarios of COVID-19 transmission. However, national and sub-national public health authorities and healthcare facilities in all countries should be doing certain core activities to support and prepare for the start of any of the activities outlined in section 5, regardless of the current state of COVID-19 transmission in the country.

2. National activities to support and enable prioritized facility IPC activities

National and sub-national public health authorities play a critical role in enabling priority IPC activities at healthcare facilities. Specific areas of focus for national and sub-national authorities should include:

Development of national or sub-national policies and guidance on implementation of priority activities outlined in section 5 of this document in healthcare facilities (e.g., HCW screening, triage at facilities, isolation and cohorting in facilities, facilitating safe home care for cases with mild symptoms, movement and monitoring of exposed HCW)

Linkage of Ministry of Health and sub-national IPC focal points to COVID-19 preparedness planning work (e.g., epidemiology and laboratory pillars)

Development of forecasting plans for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other IPC consumables (e.g., alcohol-based hand rub) that prioritize: Healthcare system needs Development of plans for stockpiling PPE Deploying stocks when need arises Communication with facilities to ensure continuity of stocks

Assessment of IPC readiness for facility inpatient areas for priority activities (outlined in section 5) and use this information to do the following: Define national referral networks to direct suspected or confirmed cases to designated, prepared hospitals Note: this is most relevant during containment phase of the response (epidemiologic scenarios 1 and 2, below) when there are relatively few cases that are epidemiologically linked Strengthen priority IPC areas at all hospitals, starting with highest risk, in preparation for limited and widespread community transmission

Development of national policies and procedures to avoid overwhelming healthcare facilities from influx of suspected COVID-19 cases, particularly mild cases. This should include: Consideration of remote triage capabilities for suspected COVID-19 cases through hotlines, telemedicine or other modalities Communicating with symptomatic contacts of known COVID-19 cases to alert designated authorities in advance of presenting for medical care Development of messaging on this topic for healthcare facilities and general population (e.g., stay at home except to get medical care)

Ensuring the availability of COVID-19 laboratory testing in country and linkages to healthcare facilities that may need testing services

Development of training materials on priority IPC activities to prevent healthcare-associated spread of COVID-19 Dissemination of training materials toto professional societies, sub-national public health authorities, healthcare facilities, and front-line healthcare workers



3. Core facility IPC activities regardless of epidemiologic scenario

Develop plans to carry out actions outlined in section 5 in order to prevent the spread of acute respiratory infections (ARI), such as COVID-19, within the facility

Develop SOPs for environmental cleaning procedures, particularly for the triage and isolation areas where suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients will be placed

Develop staffing plans to adequately staff isolation areas and consider whether cohorting staff is feasible

Develop contingency plans for PPE shortages and other IPC consumable (e.g., alcohol-based hand rub) shortages in collaboration with national and sub-national public health authorities

Develop communication plans to ensure adequate internal and external communication regarding COVID-19

Educate HCW, patients, and visitors on COVID-19 signs, symptoms, and required IPC protocols

Develop policies for visitor restriction (e.g., restrict visitors who are sick with ARI)

Develop policies to identify and risk stratify HCW exposed to COVID-19 cases and monitor their movement and return to work

Establish communication channels between healthcare facilities and public health authorities who can facilitate linkages with laboratory testing and epidemiology/contact tracing

4. Epidemiologic scenarios

No known cases in country Confirmed cases, but no known community transmission If secondary cases present, all are linked to other confirmed cases Confirmed cases, limited community transmission Limited amount of unlinked cases identified in the community Confirmed cases, widespread community transmission Many unlinked cases identified in the community

Note: there may be situations within a country whereby different geographic areas meet different scenario criteria. Ministries of Health, in coordination with relevant stakeholders, should consider the appropriateness and feasibility of applying a single set of prioritized IPC activities across the country matched to the most severe transmission scenario met versus implementing multiple sets of prioritized IPC activities in differently affected geographic units. Experience in this pandemic has shown that once a region is at scenario 2 (confirmed cases, no known community transmission), aggressive testing strategies of undiagnosed respiratory infections may quickly reveal underlying community transmission. This can result in a rapid progression to scenario 4 (widespread community transmission), sometimes within a little as a week. Thus it is absolutely critical that countries prepare aggressively for future epidemiologic scenarios even as the implement activities for their current situation. Ministries of Health and healthcare facilities must act quickly once cases are identified to prevent and prepare for scenario 4 (widespread community transmission).

5. Prioritized IPC activities for prevention and containment of COVID-19 cases, by epidemiologic scenario

Prioritized IPC activities for prevention and containment of COVID-19 cases, by epidemiologic scenario Domain Priority Activities Rationale Scenario 1: No known cases in country Limiting entry of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Passive identification of HCWs at inpatient and outpatient healthcare facilities who are ill with ARI

Reinforce messages about not coming to work if sick, especially with ARI HCWs can spread COVID-19 in healthcare facilities if they are an unknown case. This may be an early to medium indicator of introduction of COVID-19 in healthcare system. Identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Encouraging staff to maintain a high suspicion for COVID-19 if seeing inpatients with compatible symptoms and no other clear etiology of illness AND inquire about any epidemiologic links (e.g., travel history, contact with confirmed case). Systematic screening of inpatients is a resource intensive activity and ARI/healthcare-associated pneumonia is common. However, it is important that clinicians maintain a high level of suspicion for COVID-19 when there is a compatible presentation and inquire about any epidemiologic links since this may be an early sign of introduction to the healthcare facility. Triage at initial healthcare facility encounter Strengthen IPC during routine triage to ensure Standard precautions are used (e.g., hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene) and separation of ARI patients from other patients in the waiting room/triage area.

Encourage intake and medical staff to have a high suspicion for COVID-19 if seeing patients with symptoms and travel to a country with widespread community transmission or with known contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Carrying out systematic screening for COVID-19 at all healthcare facilities in a country without cases is prohibitively resource intensive with a low return on investment (i.e., low likelihood of identifying a confirmed case). Limitations in laboratory testing can make implementing systematic triage for COVID-19 at inpatient facilities in countries with no known cases very challenging. Scenario 2: Confirmed cases, but no known community transmission Limiting entry of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Same as Scenario 1 with enhancement of detection (e.g., policy for HCW to call supervisor if sick or for supervisor to report if an employee does not come to work). Once cases are identified in a country, enhancing identification of ill HCWs is necessary. Identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Same as scenario 1 with enhanced passive detection if feasible (e.g., clinician reminders to consider COVID-19 in inpatients disseminated daily) Identification of ARI clusters within a healthcare facility builds on healthcare epidemiology that should be ongoing in hospitals to review clusters of infections in time and space. During COVID-19, special attention should be paid to clusters of ARI in inpatients that might suggest a healthcare-associated COVID-19 transmission Triage at initial healthcare facility encounter Strengthen basic triage as in Scenario 1

Strengthen linkages to contact tracing teams to ensure contacts of known COVID-19 cases can access designated healthcare points if they become symptomatic in order to prevent known symptomatic contacts from showing up at unprepared healthcare facilities. Focus at this stage should be on ensuring that symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases are directed to present at healthcare facilities prepared to receive them. This is the priority activity in order to prevent COVID-19 patients from arriving unrecognized at healthcare facilities. Carrying out widespread systematic COVID-19 triage at healthcare facilities when cases are all epidemiologically linked is of lower priority. Limiting entry of visitors with suspected COVID-19

Implement policies to restrict visitors for patients with ARI admitted to healthcare facilities

Passive detection of ill visitors, e.g., encouragement of visitors to not enter facility if they have ARI Visitors to healthcare facilities have the potential to introduce COVID-19, particularly when they are close contacts of patients with suspected COVID-19 Scenario 3: Confirmed cases, limited community transmission Limiting entry of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Same as Scenario 2 AND in high-risk facilities , consider implementing active screening to identify HCWs with ARI prior to work With growing transmission comes higher utility in expanding to active screening of HCWs, especially as community transmission widens and HCWs become increasingly likely to have contact with cases outside the healthcare facility Identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Same as scenario 2 Same as rationale in scenario 2 above. Triage at initial healthcare facility encounter Strengthen IPC during routine triage as in Scenario 1

Systematic screening of patients presenting to a healthcare facility to identify COVID-19 suspect cases guided by WHO, or country-specific, case definition Once there is documented unlinked transmission in the country or geographic region, the ability to rely on identifying symptomatic contacts and sending to prepared facilities becomes less efficacious as a strategy to prevent unidentified COVID-19 cases from entering a healthcare facility. Systematic triage should be carried out widely in facilities with access to laboratory testing as this will allow the facility to quickly confirm cases for the purposes of isolation. In areas without laboratory testing capacity, systematic triage should be carried out only at facilities that at are at high risk (e.g., have a high likelihood of having cases) and can consider using a highly specific case definition (to avoid non COVID-19 cases being isolated with non-cases) Limiting entry of visitors with suspected COVID-19 Visitor restrictions same as Scenario 1, consider expanding to eliminating visitors for all inpatients

Consider implementation of active screening of visitors with ARI with non-entry for ill visitors Visitors to healthcare facilities have the potential to introduce COVID-19, particularly when they are close contacts of patients with suspected COVID-19 Scenario 4: Confirmed cases, widespread community transmission Limiting entry of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 Active screening to identify ill HCWs prior to work With widespread community transmission, as in prior outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, HCWs are high risk for becoming cases. In this scenario HCW should be actively screened prior to shifts to avoid further transmission of COVID-19 if ill. Identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19 Same as scenario 2 with consideration of screening of inpatients for COVID-19, if resources allow. With increased community transmission the likelihood of missing patients with COVID-19 at triage becomes more likely as does the likelihood of healthcare-associated transmission. Thus, increased attention to single cases of possible COVID-19 arising among inpatients should be prioritized. Triage at initial healthcare facility encounter Strengthen basic triage IPC as in Scenario 1

Systematic evaluation of every patient at triage as outlined in Scenario 3 With widespread community transmission the likelihood of finding positive cases at triage is highest, and thus, the highest priority should be placed on implementing functional triage at initial healthcare facility encounter. This will be challenging in places without access to laboratory services. Limiting entry of visitors with suspected COVID-19 Active screening of all visitors to the hospital for illness consistent with COVID-19 with non-admission for sick visitors Visitors to healthcare facilities have the potential to introduce COVID-19, particularly when they are close contacts of patients with suspected COVID-19

1 High-risk facilities should be defined by public health authorities considering: proximity to facilities or communities with known COVID-19 cases, including those across administrative or international borders as well as prioritizing facilities seeing large numbers of patients at high risk of being a COVID-19 case and where introduction would be highly disruptive (e.g., large referral hospitals)

6. Additional considerations for inpatient facilities with admitted cases of confirmed COVID-19

Regardless of epidemiologic scenario in a country, once an inpatient facility is housing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, specific IPC precautions for isolation will apply. These are outlined by the World Health Organization and accessible at the links below. Pursuant to this document, facilities with confirmed cases may need to carry out prioritized activities from other epidemiologic scenarios even if those scenarios do not represent the country-wide COVID-19 situation. This could include, for instance, a hospital with confirmed COVID-19 cases choosing to conduct active screening of healthcare workers for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, despite this not being listed under the routine priority activities in that country’s epidemiologic scenario.

This document is intended for healthcare facilities that are receiving or are preparing to receive patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This includes healthcare facilities providing either inpatient or outpatient services. It should be used to guide implementation of procedures at triage that can be effective at preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus) to patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). This document was developed based on current COVID-19 data and experience with other respiratory viruses and will be updated as more information becomes available.

1.1 What is triage

“The sorting out and classificationexternal icon of patientsexternal icon or casualties to determine priority of need and proper place of treatmentexternal icon.”1 During infectious disease outbreaks, triage is particularly important to separate patients likely to be infected with the pathogen of concern. This triage SOP is developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and does not replace any routine clinical triage already in place in healthcare facilities (e.g. Manchester triage system or equivalent2) to categorize patients into different urgency categories.

1.2 COVID-19 transmission

The main route of transmission of COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Any person who is in close contact with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., sneezing, coughing, etc.) is at risk of being exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets.3 Droplets may also land on surfaces where the virus could remain viable for several hours to days. Transmission can occur from hands contacting contaminated surfaces and then coming into contact with the person’s mucosa such as nose, mouth and eyes.

2. What patients can do before and upon arrival to a healthcare facility

Inform healthcare providers if they are seeking care for COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, loss of smell or taste, sore throat or other) 4 by calling ahead of time.

by calling ahead of time. Wear a medical mask (e.g., surgical or procedure masks) and, if not available, wear a cloth or fabric mask during transport and while at triage in the healthcare facility. 5

Notify triage registration desk about symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 as soon as they arrive.

Wash hands at healthcare facility entrance with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.

Carry paper or fabric tissues to cover mouth or nose when coughing or sneezing. Dispose paper tissues in a trash can immediately after use.

Maintain social distance by staying at least two meters away according to CDC guidance whenever possible, from anyone, including anyone that is with the patient (e.g., companion or caregiver).

3. What healthcare facilities can do to minimize risk of infection among patients and healthcare workers

Communicate with patients before arriving for triage

Establish a hotline that: Patients can call or text notifying the facility that they are seeking care due to COVID-19 symptoms. Can be used, if possible, as telephone consultation for patients to determine the need to visit a healthcare facility. Serves to inform patients of preventive measures to take as they come to the facility (e.g., wearing mask, having tissues to cover cough or sneeze).

Provide information to the general public through local mass media such as radio, television, newspapers, and social media platforms about availability of a hotline and the signs and symptoms of COVID-19.

Healthcare facilities, in conjunction with national authorities, should consider telemedicine (e.g., telephone, audio-video calls, or secure messaging) to provide clinical support without direct contact with the patient.6 However, patients with any emergency warning signs such as trouble breathing, new confusion, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, or inability to wake or stay awake should seek medical care immediately.

Set up and equip triage

Limit point of entry to the health facility.

Have clear signs at the entrance pdf icon of the facility directing patients with COVID-19 symptoms to immediately report to the registration desk in the emergency department or at the unit they are seeking care (e.g., maternity, pediatric, HIV clinic). Facilities should consider having a separate registration desk for patients coming in with COVID-19 symptoms, especially at the emergency departments, and clear signs at the entrance directing patients to the designated registration desk.

Facilities should consider having a separate registration desk for patients coming in with COVID-19 symptoms, especially at the emergency departments, and clear signs at the entrance directing patients to the designated registration desk. Ensure availability of medical masks and paper tissue at registration desk, as well as nearby hand hygiene stations. A bin with lid should be available at triage where patients can discard used paper tissues.

Install physical barriers (e.g., glass or plastic screens) for registration desk (i.e., reception area) and maintain a distance of at least two meters to limit close contact between registration desk personnel and potentially infectious patients.

Ensure availability of hand hygiene stations in triage area, including waiting areas.

Post visual alerts at the entrance of the facility and in strategic areas (e.g., waiting areas or elevators) about respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and social distancing. This includes how to cover nose and mouth pdf icon when coughing or sneezing and disposal of contaminated items in trash cans.

when coughing or sneezing and disposal of contaminated items in trash cans. Assign dedicated clinical staff (e.g. physicians or nurses) for physical evaluation of patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms at triage. These staff should be trained on triage procedures, COVID-19 case definition, and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) use (i.e., mask, eye protection, gown and gloves).

Train administrative personnel working in the reception area on how to perform hand hygiene, maintain appropriate distance, and on how to advise patients on the proper use of medical masks, hand hygiene, and separation from other patients.

A standardized triage algorithm/questionnaire image icon should be available for use and should include questions that will determine if the patient meets the COVID-19 case definition4,7. Algorithms should be adjusted based on settings and epidemiologic considerations in each country. HCWs should be encouraged to have a high level of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 given the global pandemic.

Set up a separate waiting area for suspected COVID-19 patients

Healthcare facilities without enough single isolation rooms or those located in areas with high community transmission should designate a separate, well-ventilated area where patients at high risk* for COVID-19 can wait. This area should have benches, stalls or chairs separated by at least two meters distance. The waiting areas should have dedicated toilets and hand hygiene stations. Patients who are suspected to have COVID-19 should not be mixed with COVID-19 confirmed patients in isolation areas. 4

Post clear signs informing patients of the location of waiting areas for suspected COVID-19. Train the registration desk staff to direct patients immediately to these areas after registration.

Provide paper tissues, alcohol-based hand rub, and trash bins with lids for the separate COVID-19 waiting area.

Develop a process to reduce the amount of time patients are in the COVID-19 waiting area, which may include: Allocation of additional staff to triage patients suspected of COVID-19 Setting up a notification system that allows patients to wait in a personal vehicle or outside of the facility (if medically appropriate) in a place where social distance can be maintained and they can be easily notified by phone or other remote methods when it is their turn to be evaluated.



Triage process

A medical mask should be given to patients with respiratory symptoms as soon as they get to the facility if they do not already have one. All patients in the separate COVID-19 waiting area should wear a medical mask.

If medical masks are not available, provide paper tissues or request the patient to cover their nose and mouth with a scarf, bandana, or T-shirt during the entire triage process, including while in the COVID-19 waiting area. A homemade cloth mask can also be used as source control, if the patient has one. Exercise caution as these items will become contaminated and can serve as a source of transmission to other patients or family members. WHO’s guidance should be followed by patients and family members to clean these items. (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-infection-prevention-and-control-for-health-care-workers-caring-for-patients-with-suspected-or-confirmed-2019-ncov external icon ).

). Use a standardized triage algorithm image icon to immediately isolate/separate patients at high risk* for having COVID-19 in single-person rooms with doors closed or designated COVID-19 waiting areas.

to immediately isolate/separate patients at high risk* for having COVID-19 in single-person rooms with doors closed or designated COVID-19 waiting areas. Limit the number of accompanying family members in the waiting area for suspected COVID-19 patients (do not allow children aged <18 years unless a patient or a parent). Anyone in the separate waiting area for suspected COVID-19 should wear a medical mask. If medical mask is not available, wear a cloth mask or use multiple layers paper tissues or other fabrics such as T-shirts or scarfs to cover their nose and mouth.

Triage area, including a separate waiting area for suspected COVID-19, should be cleaned at least twice a day with a focus on frequently touched surfaces. Disinfection can be done with 0.1% (1000ppm) chlorine pdf icon or 70% alcohol for surfaces that do not tolerate chlorine. For large blood and body fluid spills, 0.5% (5000ppm) chlorine pdf icon is recommended.8

*defined as patients at high risk for having COVID-19 based on clinical and epidemiologic criteria (e.g., travel history or exposure to someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19). Definition may change depending on where countries or regions within countries are in the stage of outbreak (e.g. no or limited vs. widespread community transmission).

4. What healthcare workers (HCWs) can do to protect themselves and their patients during triage

All HCWs should adhere to Standard Precautions, which includes hand hygiene, selection of PPE based on risk assessment, respiratory hygiene, cleaning and disinfection and injection safety practices.

All HCWs should be trained on and familiar with infection prevention and control (IPC) precautions (e.g. contact and droplet precautions, appropriate hand hygiene, donning and doffing of PPE) related to COVID-19. Follow appropriate PPE donning and doffing steps pdf icon . Perform frequent hand hygiene with an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty or with soap and water if hands are dirty.

HCWs who come in contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should wear appropriate PPE: HCWs in triage areas who are conducting preliminary screening do not require PPE if they DO NOT have direct contact with the patient and MAINTAIN distance of at least two meters. Examples: HCWs at the registration desk that are asking limited questions based on triage protocol. Installation of physical barriers (e.g., glass or plastic screens) are encouraged if possible. HCWs providing medical masks or taking temperatures with infrared thermometers as long as a distance of at least two meters can be safely maintained. When physical distance is NOT feasible and yet NO direct contact with patients occurs, use a medical mask and eye protection (face shield or goggles). HCWs conducing physical examination of patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear gowns, gloves, a medical mask and eye protection (goggles or face shield). Cleaners in triage, waiting and examination areas should wear a gown, heavy duty gloves, a medical mask, eye protection (if risk of splash from organic material or chemical), boots or closed work shoes.

HCWs who develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of smell or taste, sore throat) should stay home and not perform triage or any other duties at the healthcare facility.

Ensure that environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/water-sanitation-hygiene-and-waste-management-for-covid-19 external icon ).

5. Additional considerations for triage during periods of community transmission

Begin or reinforce existing alternatives to face-to-face triage and visits such as telemedicine. 6

Designate an area near the facility (e.g., an ancillary building or temporary structure) or identify a location in the area to be a “COVID-19 evaluation center” where patients with symptoms of COVID-19 can seek evaluation and care.

Expand hours of operation, if possible, to limit crowding at triage during peak hours.

Cancel non-urgent outpatient visits to ensure enough HCWs are available to provide support for COVID-19 clinical care, including triage services. Critical or urgent outpatient visits (e.g. infant vaccination or prenatal checkup for high-risk pregnancy) should continue, however, facilities should ensure separate/dedicated entry for patients coming for critical outpatient visits to not place them at risk of COVID-19.

Consider postponing or cancelling elective procedures and surgeries depending on the local epidemiologic context.

1. Overview

This document provides guidance on the identification or screening of healthcare workers1 and inpatients with symptoms of suspected COVID-19. Rational, requirements, and considerations will be discussed for three broad case identification strategies:

Passive strategies : Reporting/alerts are initiated by the data source (e.g., healthcare worker or treating clinician) based on a known set of rules or regulations.

: Reporting/alerts are initiated by the data source (e.g., healthcare worker or treating clinician) based on a known set of rules or regulations. Enhanced passive strategies : Reporting/alerts are initiated by the data source with an added mechanism to prompt data collection, review, and/or reporting.

: Reporting/alerts are initiated by the data source with an added mechanism to prompt data collection, review, and/or reporting. Active strategies: Reporting/alerts are initiated by the centralized health authority (e.g., Ministry of Health, facility infection preventionist, facility administration) using a known set of rules or regulations.

Additional guidance on managing visitors to healthcare facilities and triage of suspected COVID-19 patients in non-US healthcare settings is also available.

While, epidemiologic, virologic, and modeling reports support the possibility of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, transmission from persons who are presymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected before symptom onset) or asymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected but symptoms never develop), critical knowledge gaps remain regarding the benefit of routine or repeated screening of healthcare workers and inpatients without symptoms for prevention of COVID-19 spread within health facilities outside of an outbreak response scenario.2 Therefore, discussion around optimal testing strategies for the identification of healthcare workers with presymptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection are outside the scope of this guidance.

2. Signs and Symptoms Consistent with COVID-19

Presenting signs and symptoms of COVID-19 vary, limiting the definition of a generalizable set of characteristic signs and symptoms for COVID-19. At best, current evidence suggests substantial variability ranging from mild to severe and based on only partially described patient-level factors. The WHO interim guidance for clinical management of COVID-19external icon provides the following summary of published COVID-19 symptom descriptions and observed frequency (see box):

Among persons who develop symptoms, most experience fever (83%–99%), cough (59%–82%), fatigue (44%–70%), anorexia (40%–84%), shortness of breath (31%–40%), and myalgias (11%–35%). Other non-specific symptoms, such as sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, have also been reported. Loss of smell (anosmia) or loss of taste (ageusia) preceding the onset of respiratory symptoms has also been reported. Older people and immunosuppressed patients in particular may present with atypical symptoms such as fatigue, reduced alertness, reduced mobility, diarrhea, loss of appetite, delirium, and absence of fever. Symptoms such as dyspnea, fever, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms or fatigue due to physiologic adaptations in pregnant women, adverse pregnancy events, or other diseases such as malaria, may overlap with symptoms of COVID-19. Children might not have reported fever or cough as frequently as adults.

Given these limitations, facilities should define a standardized set of signs and symptoms (e.g., fever and/or cough/shortness of breath) to screen healthcare workers and patients for suspected COVID-19. A high level of suspicion is critical to ensure cases do not go unrecognized due to a substantial proportion of patients and healthcare workers presenting with atypical or minimal symptoms.

3. General Best Practices

In addition to a specific strategy for the identification of suspected COVID-19 cases, there are general best practices that will improve both healthcare worker and inpatient COVID-19 screening. Some examples include:

Monitor and Manage Ill and Exposed Healthcare Workers

Facilities and organizations providing healthcare should implement sick leave policies for healthcare workers that are non-punitive, flexible, and consistent with public health guidance.

Movement and monitoring decisions for healthcare workers with exposure to COVID-19 should be made in consultation with public health authorities.

Train and Educate Healthcare Workers

Provide healthcare workers with job- or task-specific education and training on identifying and preventing transmission of infectious agents, including refresher training.

Ensure that healthcare workers are educated, trained, and have practiced the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) prior to caring for a patient.

Provide job-aids and up-to-date reference materials.

Encourage and support a high index of suspicion in healthcare workers regarding suspect COVID-19 cases.

Establish Reporting within and between Healthcare Facilities and to Public Health Authorities

Implement mechanisms and policies that promote situational awareness for facility staff about confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients and facility plans for response, including: Infection control Healthcare epidemiology Facility leadership Occupational health Clinical laboratory Frontline staff

Communicate and collaborate with public health authorities.

Communicate information about confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients to appropriate personnel before transferring to other departments in the facility and to other healthcare facilities.

4. Surveillance Capacities

Facility-based surveillance for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), including infections in healthcare workers and inpatients, is one of the WHO’s eight core components of infection prevention and control (IPC)external icon. While surveillance is a critical component of providing safe healthcare, it is important to recognize that it requires expertise, good quality data, and an established IPC program and thus, may require time to set up. For this reason, during public health emergency response, healthcare facilities are encouraged to initially implement facility-based, suspect COVID-19 patient case finding (surveillance) that is feasible with existing surveillance capacities.

Health facility surveillance capacity varies greatly even within health systems. A realistic appraisal of capacity can help identify the best strategy for a given context. A general description of surveillance capacities based on existing HAI surveillance activity is provided for guidance.

Surveillance Capacities Surveillance Capacity Standardized HAI case definitions / methods Dedicated surveillance staff3 Patient-level data available / accessible High: Resources needed for detailed patient interviews and/or chart reviews are readily available YES YES YES Medium: Some experience with standardized data collection with limitation in staff and data availability YES PARTIAL PARTIAL Low to Very Low: Little to no experience with patient-level collection of standardized data, limited availability of staff and data for reassignment for case finding activities PARTIAL NO NO

5. Identification of Healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19

Objective: Prevent exposure of at-risk patients and staff to symptomatic COVID-19 positive healthcare workers.

Figure: Passive identification of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19

Passive strategy

All healthcare workers self-assess for fever and/or a defined set of newly present symptoms indicative of COVID-19. If fever or respiratory symptoms are present, healthcare workers:

Remotely report this information 4

Do not go to their health facility

Are provided with immediate medical assessment and follow-up actions

Rationale:

Establishes mechanisms for the identification of healthcare workers at increased likelihood of infection with minimal resource requirements.

Requirements:

List of symptoms and thermometer for self-assessment.

Staff and mechanism (e.g., telephone line) for remote reporting of fever and/or presence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Ideally this system is always available for quick medical assessment. If reporting system is not available, symptomatic healthcare workers should not report to their facility until they can be evaluated.

Decision algorithms for response to healthcare worker reports and the results of secondary assessment.

Standardized medical assessment and movement and monitoring forms.

Considerations:

Adherence is highly dependent on healthcare worker motivation and appropriate self-assessment of risk.

Can result in reduction in work force, particularly among some critical staffing categories.

Provision of paid sick leave/compensation for all healthcare workers not allowed to work is often critical for success, requiring substantial resources.

In addition to passive strategy, establish a plan to remind or prompt workers to self-assess for symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Common reminders include automated text messages or phone calls.

Rationale:

Evidence suggests that simple automatic reminders can increase adherence.

Requirements:

All requirements of Passive Strategy

Automated (e.g., mass texting service) or manual system (e.g., direct messaging or phone calls) to contact healthcare workers as prompt for self-assessment

Requirements (Automated System):

Mass Text Messaging Services capable of sending text messages to groups of people simultaneously. Mass Text Messaging Services are sometimes provided by independent internet-based service companies or are sometimes provided by cellular service providers.

Database of contacts (i.e., healthcare workers under monitoring). In addition to contact number, database fields may include name, position, work unit/area, and monitoring end date.

An effective and informative text message including frequency of messaging, timing of delivery, and any interactivity of interventions5.

Requirements (Manual System):

Database of contacts (i.e., healthcare workers under monitoring). Because of the effort required in manual systems, this database should be carefully targeted to minimize workload and maximize benefit. Considerations for targeting might include: Documented COVID-19 exposure Serving a population at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 Serving a population at increased risk of being COVID-19 positive cases

Staff available to contact monitored healthcare workers with reminders.

Phone and phone credit to support messaging and or calls.

Considerations:

Same as Passive Strategy

Funding may be required to support bulk text messaging

Figure: Active identification of healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19

Active strategy

All healthcare workers present for in-person evaluation of symptoms and fever prior to each shift. If symptoms consistent of COVID-19 are reported or observed, healthcare workers are provided with immediate follow-up actions.

Remote active strategy

All healthcare workers report (e.g., by call or text) the absence or presence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 remotely each day. Staff that fail to report or report symptoms are followed up.

Rationale:

While there is limited evidence for the benefit of active healthcare worker monitoring, active strategies will theoretically result in increased healthcare worker adherence to self-evaluation of symptoms, thus enhancing patient and healthcare worker protection.

Requirements (Active strategy):

All requirements of Passive Strategy

Dedicated staff to evaluate healthcare workers before their shift (active) or respond and monitor healthcare worker reports

Physical area for staff evaluations that will allow recommended social distancing (i.e., at least one meter) and includes adequate hand hygiene stations (soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub)

No touch thermometers

Implementation plan that includes a method to ensure that staff present at a given place for pre-shift evaluation

Accountability system to ensure all healthcare workers have been evaluated (e.g., work slip sign-off)

Requirements (Remote Active Strategy):

All requirements of Passive Strategy

Accountability system to ensure all healthcare workers report in remotely prior to their work shift

Considerations:

Same as Passive Strategy.

Active monitoring of healthcare workers can be highly resource-intensive. There is limited evidence of increased effectiveness in prevention of nosocomial transmission beyond passive strategies.

Acceptance by staff can be limited by perceptions of mistrust in ability to monitor and appropriately report symptoms.

Active monitoring can decrease the likelihood that healthcare workers self-monitor signs and symptoms. Ideally, healthcare workers are checking their own temperature and symptoms and will not present if not indicated. Any action that weakens self-monitoring should be implemented with caution.

To decrease workload, and if accountability can be maintained, the following can be delegated to unit/immediate supervisors (e.g., head/charge nurses, department heads): Responsibility for receiving symptom/temperature reports Monitoring staff compliance for the remote active strategy



6. Identification of Inpatients with suspected COVID-19

The development of acute respiratory infection and healthcare-associated pneumonia are common complications of hospitalization. However, it is important that clinicians maintain a high level of suspicion for COVID-19 when there is a compatible presentation. Because healthcare facilities often represent a gathering of individuals at higher risk of infection and adverse outcomes, the potential for outbreaks and harm to patients requires special effort to ensure any inpatient COVID-19 cases are identified.

A goal of identifying inpatients with suspected COVID-19 is to guide IPC strategies to prevent or limit transmission in healthcare setting. See interim WHO guidance on infection prevention and control during health care when COVID-19 is suspectedexternal icon.

Figure: Passive strategy for identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19

Passive Strategy:

Clinicians are kept informed6 on:

Current COVID-19 case definitions external icon

Latest description of COVID-19 clinical presentation

Relevant local epidemiology, including at risk groups and association with travel or area of residence

Clinicians are also made aware of what to do if they suspect COVID-19 in a hospitalized patient, including isolation precautions, PPE use, reporting/informing IPC focal point at the facility and public health authorities, and how to obtain testing, if available.

Recommended Surveillance Capacity Level:

Applicable at all HAI surveillance capacity levels (i.e., very low to high)

Rationale:

Minimal disruption of existing clinical practice and no requirement for standardized data collection or form completion. Strategy seeks to encourage recognition and reporting by astute clinicians.

Requirements:

Regular and up-to-date educational materials/job aids provided to and accessible by clinicians

COVID-19 case definitions

Standard operating procedure (SOP) for response to identified suspect case patients (e.g., isolation, cohorting, PPE).

Acceptable reporting/communication channels to hospital administration and public health authorities

Considerations:

Strategy is dependent on participation and skill of available clinicians and an understanding of local epidemiology and clinical presentation of COVID-19, which may differ in different populations.

Limited access to diagnostic testing will complicate this effort with the most conservative strategy being to treat all suspect cases as confirmed cases (empirical case determination) – potentially wasting resources, and if cases are cohorted, mixing positive and negative patients for extended periods. The degree of resource waste and case patient mixing will depend on the accuracy of empirical case determination. Supporting empirical case determination through clinician education and job aids (as described) can help improve accuracy of clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.



Figure: Enhanced passive strategy for identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19

Enhanced Passive Strategy:

Enhancement of the passive strategy can be achieved through establishing systems that prompt or require clinicians to regularly review all patients for suspected COVID-19. Example enhanced passive strategies might include:

Incorporating consideration of COVID-19 into sign-out reporting

Requiring units to provide a daily clinician-generated list of suspected cases, including if there are zero cases

Sending specific daily requests to clinicians to report and discuss encountered patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19

Recommended Surveillance Capacity Level:

Applicable in most HAI surveillance capacity levels (very low to high)

Rationale:

Dialogue and accountability for case finding and reporting can improve empirical case determination, ensure patient evaluations are not missed, and help avoid clinician complacency over the long-term

Requirements:

All requirements of Passive Strategy

Strategy to prompt and/or ensure clinician review – requirements will depend on selected strategy

Considerations:

Effective strategies will be context specific and require thought and effort in design and implementation

May represent changes to current practice, which can limit acceptability

Figure: Active strategy for identification of inpatients with suspected COVID-19

Active Strategy:

Active case identification involves targeted data collection and review of patient information by groups specifically responsible for the identification of suspected COVID-19 cases. Examples of groups responsible for case identification and active case identification may include:

Ministries of Health

Sub-national/local public health authorities

Facility infection prevention and control teams

Recommended Surveillance Capacity Level:

High existing surveillance capacity or medium capacity with the provision of additional resources

Rationale:

Smaller more centralized team responsible for case identification can increase overall quality through dedicated training, improved engagement, limiting of competing priorities, and standardization of methods

Requirements:

Team with the information access, resources, and experience necessary for systematic review of patient information in order to appropriately apply standardized suspect case definitions

Group(s) with availability and responsibility for data collection, analysis/presentation, and information sharing

Group(s) with availability and responsibility for review of case-finding information with the authority and willingness to take appropriate action

Management of Visitors to Healthcare Facilities in the Context of COVID-19: Non-US Healthcare Settings,"2. Visitors to healthcare facilities should be limited in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of known community transmission. If visitors are allowed:

Facilities should designate an entrance that visitors can use to access the healthcare facility. Visitors who are noted by healthcare facility staff to have fever or other symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) should be instructed to leave the facility and seek care if needed. Facilities should encourage visitors to be aware of signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness consistent with COVID-19 and not enter the facility if they have such signs and symptoms. Visual alerts, such as signs and posters, should be placed at facility entrances and other strategic areas instructing visitors not to enter as a visitor if they have fever or respiratory symptoms. Signage should include signs and symptoms pdf icon of COVID-19 and who to notify if visitors have symptoms. Visitors are strongly discouraged from visiting patients who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. If visitors are allowed, facilities should follow national policies regarding the use of medical masks or face covers (e.g., homemade mask) by healthy visitors. 1



Facilities should apply alternatives for direct interaction between visitors and patients, including setting up remote communications (e.g., telephone or internet connection) in the isolation area to allow for video or audio calls.

Facilities should have staff members who are able to provide training and education to visitors. All visitors allowed to visit patients should be educated on: Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 including instructions on who to notify if they develop symptoms. Performing hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 40 seconds or by using an alcohol-based hand rub with at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol for at least 20 seconds. Facilities should provide adequate supplies for visitors to perform hand hygiene. Following respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette (e.g., covering mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when coughing or sneezing) in the event an individual develops respiratory symptoms while visiting the facility. Facilities should provide adequate supplies for visitors to perform respiratory hygiene and should instruct visitors with cough or other respiratory symptoms to immediately leave the facility and seek care if needed.



3. Considerations during community transmission of COVID-19

Thresholds should be established to determine when active screening of all visitors will be initiated.

During active screening, all visitors should be assessed before entering the healthcare facility for symptoms of acute respiratory illness consistent with COVID-19. If a visitor has symptoms, they should not be allowed to enter the facility.

During widespread community transmission of COVID-19, visitor access to healthcare facilities should be restricted. Only visitors essential for helping to provide patient care and/or caring for pediatric patients should be allowed. Facilities should consider requiring all essential visitors to wear a medical mask or face cover, according to national policies, to prevent COVID-19 transmission in the facility from pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals.

4. When visiting COVID-19 patients is essential such as for pediatric patients and/or for basic patient care and feeding:

Visitors to areas where patients with COVID-19 are isolated should be limited to essential visitors such as those helping to provide patient care and/or caring for pediatric patients. Limit to one visitor/caregiver 2 per patient with COVID-19 at a time.

per patient with COVID-19 at a time. Visits should be scheduled to allow enough time for screening, education, and training of visitors.

Visitors should be assessed to determine risks to their health. Visitors who are at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, 3 such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions, should be strongly discouraged.

such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions, should be strongly discouraged. Movement of visitors in the healthcare facility should be restricted. Visitors should only visit the patient they are caring for and should not go to other locations in the facility.

Facilities should provide education on appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) use, hand hygiene, limiting surfaces touched, social distancing, and movement within the facility. Training on PPE use should be conducted by a trained healthcare worker and include observations of the visitor to ensure correct donning and doffing of PPE and appropriate hand hygiene. Appropriate disposal of PPE should be ensured by facility staff. Because patients with COVID-19 are on isolation precautions and PPE supplies are limited, facilities should enforce visitor restriction policies. PPE should not be shared among family members of a patient with COVID-19. If PPE is not available for visitors, and a visitor is essential for helping to provide patient care, follow PPE contingency plans.

Facilities should make sure that visitors understand the potential risks associated with providing care to patients with COVID-19, especially for visitors at high risk for serious illness from COVID-19 and those who are primary caregivers and have extended contact with patients (e.g., parents or guardians of children).

Visitors should not be present during aerosol-generating procedures or during collection of respiratory specimens.

Facilities should consider the need to conduct active screening for visitors with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to a breach in infection prevention and control (IPC) protocol.

Operational Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control in Outpatient Facilities: non-U.S. Healthcare Settings,"1. Background

This document outlines strategies for implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance for non-U.S. outpatient care settings in response to community spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Clinics and facilities that provide outpatient services play an important role in a healthcare system’s response to COVID-19 and are critical to provide continued essential health services. This information complements available IPC guidanceexternal icon for COVID-19.

2. Target Audience

These operational considerations are intended to be used by healthcare facilities and public health authorities in non-U.S. healthcare settings. Outpatient facilities can include community health centers, hospital-based outpatient clinics, non-hospital-based clinics, physician offices, alternate care sites, and others.

3. Objectives

The purpose of IPC in outpatient settings during the COVID-19 pandemic is to: 1) minimize disease transmission to patients and health workers (HWs), 2) identify persons with signs and symptoms of suspected COVID-19 for rapid isolation and triage, and 3) maintain essential health services.

4. Responsible Personnel to Implement IPC in Outpatient Settings

IPC activities in outpatient settings should be planned, implemented, and overseen by designated staff with experience in IPC. In many settings, these dedicated staff may consult other stakeholders such as facility leadership, occupational health, nursing, environmental services, engineering, or other relevant staff in the form of an IPC committee.

Designated IPC staff (or an IPC focal point) at facilities should also consult and coordinate activities with local and national IPC public health authorities based in the Ministry of Health or other relevant institution. In many settings, these district or national-level IPC focal points can help to provide supportive supervision of ongoing activities to assist facility staff in effective implementation.

5. Key Considerations for Outpatient Facilities

There are four operational steps to consider when planning outpatient service continuation in the context of COVID-19:

Modify service delivery through IPC administrative and engineering controls to maximize patient and HW safety Prepare staff and facilities to receive patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 Implement controls to rapidly identify and isolate patients with suspected COVID-19 Implement IPC for alternate care sites and non-facility-based care

A. Modify service delivery through IPC administrative and engineering controls to maximize patient and HW safety

Modifications to outpatient operations (e.g., IPC administrative controls) and modifications to the physical layout of a facility (e.g., IPC engineering controls) are important ways to reduce crowding and mixing of potentially infectious and non-infectious patients at facilities, preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the process. Coordination with local public health authorities is helpful to expand strategies available to an individual facility (e.g., identifying alternate care sites for essential health services). Additionally, in communities with widespread community transmissionexternal icon of COVID-19, implementing source control of all patients, visitors, and HWs at clinics through wearing of non-medical masks can also reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. While non-medical masks are recommended for the general population, medical masksexternal icon should be prioritized for HWs or vulnerable populations, including persons aged ≥60 years or persons with underlying co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, or persons with immunosuppression.

Strategies to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in outpatient facilities for essential and non-essential health services and for modifications for patients who are acutely ill or have respiratory symptoms are described below:

Modifications to outpatient operations for essential health services to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission

Detailed considerations for modifying service delivery of essential health services, including disease-specific considerations, can be found here. Minimum IPC requirements to maintain essential health services external icon have also been described. Examples of such strategies include: Consider dedicating certain days/times for services (e.g., vaccinations on Mondays, obstetric patients on Thursdays, etc.). Dispense additional doses of medications for patients with stable, chronic disease to reduce number of times a patient needs to visit the pharmacy. Identify separate locations (e.g., schools, churches, etc.) for holding well visits for children. Consider non-facility-based settings (e.g., outreach or mobile services) for delivery of services based on the local context and ability to ensure IPC practices and safety of HWs and the community.

have also been described. Examples of such strategies include:

Modifications to outpatient operations for non-essential health services during COVID-19

Identify non-essential health services that can be delayed or canceled in accordance with any local or national guidance. Postponing non-essential health services allows HWs to be available to provide COVID-19 care and reduces crowding in waiting rooms. Examples of such services include routine vision or dental check-ups and annual physical exams.

Explore alternatives to in-person encounters (see section below).

Modifications to outpatient operations for patients who are acutely ill or have symptoms consistent with COVID-19external icon

Outpatient facilities, in conjunction with national authorities, could consider alternatives to in-person triage as well as visits using telemedicine (e.g., telephone consultations or cell phone videoconference) to provide clinical support without direct contact with the patient. Establish a hotline that: Patients can call or text notifying the facility that they are seeking care due to respiratory symptoms or other acute illnesses. Can be used as telephone consultation for patients to determine if they need to visit a healthcare facility. Can inform patients of preventive measures to take as they come to the facility (e.g., wearing mask or having tissues to cover coughs or sneezes). Provide information to the general public through local mass media such as radio, television, newspapers, and social media platforms about availability of a hotline, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and when to seek care.

If a patient with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 can be managed by telephone and advised to stay home: Assess the patient’s ability to engage in home monitoring, their ability to safely isolate at home, and the risk of them transmitting the virus to others in their home environment. Provide clear instructions to caregivers and sick persons regarding home care (WHO home care guidance external icon ) and when and how to access the healthcare system for face-to-face care or urgent/emergent conditions. If possible, identify HWs who can monitor those patients at home with daily “check-ins” using telephone calls, text, or other means.



B. Prepare staff and facilities to receive patients with suspected COVID-19

Despite modifications to outpatient operations to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission at facilities, patients with possible COVID-19 will still be seen. Optimizing preparedness of facilities to receive patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 can help limit the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients and staff. Facility leadership and the IPC focal point should review WHO IPC guidance during health care when COVID-19 is suspectedexternal icon and follow national IPC guidance to begin preparing facilities to safely triage and manage patients with respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Consider the following measures:

Infection control infrastructure and healthcare workforce

C. Rapidly identify and separate patients with suspected COVID-19

As recommended by WHOexternal icon, all patients arriving at outpatient facilities require screening to rapidly identify and separate patients with suspected COVID-19. The IPC focal point at the facility, under authority from facility leadership, should oversee implementation of screening to prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 at these facilities. Screening and triage can be operationalized in the following ways:

Place visual alerts such as signs and posters at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction (in local languages) on hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and maintaining physical distance of at least 2 meters from other patients and staff.

Establish a separate registration desk for patients coming in with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and place signs at the entrance directing patients to the designated registration desk. Consider installing physical barriers (e.g., glass or plastic screens) for registration desk/reception area to limit direct contact between registration desk personnel and potentially infectious patients.

At registration, every patient should be asked if they have a standard set of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 external icon based on local or national guidance. Patients with any one of these symptoms meet criteria for suspected COVID-19 and should be: Given a medical mask (or at least paper tissues to cover their nose and mouth when in the presence of others, if masks are unavailable) for source control; Separated from patients without any of these symptoms in a different waiting area, ideally outdoors, if weather permits; and Fast-tracked for clinical assessment.

based on local or national guidance. Patients with any one of these symptoms meet criteria for suspected COVID-19 and should be: Registration/triage desks should be stocked with supplies of medical masks and paper tissues, and access to nearby hand hygiene stations (soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub) should be made available. If screening personnel are unable to maintain physical distance of ≥2 meters from patients, they should wear a medical mask and eye protection (e.g., goggles or face shield) and have easy access hand hygiene stations.



After screening, patients with suspected COVID-19 should be fast-tracked for clinical assessment, which would ideally occur in a single-person room. During clinical assessment, ensure that windows, if present in the room, are opened as fully as possible to optimize ventilation and close doors that lead to hallways. Prior to entering the room, perform hand hygiene (using a station that should be located near the outside of the room) and wear all recommended PPE.

D . Implement IPC for alternate care sites and non-facility-based care

To minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the use of alternate care sites or non-facility-based models of healthcare delivery may be considered to separate healthy patients in need of essential health services from patients seeking care for acute illness. Alternate care sites include community-based locations, such as schools or churches, that might be temporarily out-of-use due to local mitigation measures. Such sites offer the benefit of space to allow appropriate physical distancing of staff and patients. However, since these sites are not primarily intended for the delivery of healthcare, their structure might not be suitable for outpatient services that require physical exams and are best used to deliver single-purpose care, e.g., drug pick-ups, immunizationspdf iconexternal icon, or well-child visits. Similarly, non-facility-based care, which includes outreach services to people’s homes or mobile services, help minimize crowding at healthcare facilities while maintaining essential health services.

IPC is always needed wherever healthcare is delivered, including in alternate care sites and non-facility-based care. At a minimum, HWs delivering care in these settings require education and training in good IPC practices, including standard and transmission-based precautions. Patients and staff should maintain physical separation of at least 2 meters from others at all times. Additional IPC considerations for specific situations are below:

Alternate care sites Establish a system of screening and triage for patients arriving at alternate care sites as described in section C

Outreach to patients’ homes Practice frequent hand hygiene before and after each patient encounter using portable alcohol-based hand rub. Given that HWs might encounter persons or families with respiratory symptoms, consider extended use of medical masks and eye protection (e.g., face shields or goggles) for each shift. For healthcare services that require gloves or gowns, special considerations are needed for appropriate donning, doffing, and disposal of this PPE due to variable availability of space to don/doff PPE and limited access to waste receptacles for disposal of PPE.

Mobile medical units Ensure that the vehicle is well-ventilated by opening all windows. Stock vehicle with adequate supplies of alcohol-based hand rub for frequent hand hygiene and all recommended PPE. Bring visual alerts or signs to encourage patients to take appropriate IPC precautions while waiting in queues, including maintaining physical distance of at least 2 meters from others and practicing hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette.

Operational Considerations for Personal Protective Equipment in the Context of Global Supply Shortages for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: non-US Healthcare Settings,"Purpose and scope of this document:

Training Slides This slide deck is a reference for content on this page and can be used for training.

This document provides specific operational considerations that healthcare settings and healthcare authorities can review in the context of global supply shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), to help with decision making in order to provide needed surge capacity during the COVID-19 response.

This document draws from CDC strategies for US-healthcare settings on COVID-19: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE | CDC and includes potential strategies that may be considered in non-US contexts.

This document should be reviewed alongside WHO’s guidance on the Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pdf iconexternal icon which defines strategies to optimize the availability of PPE and options for temporary measures during severe shortage of PPE.

High-level and continued efforts will be needed to maintain and scale-up the PPE supply chain to ensure availability of PPE in healthcare settings where it is needed, to avoid supply shortages, and allow adherence to IPC standard practice.

Wherever possible, emergency PPE strategies should not be used in hospital wards housing severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19, as well as those with known co-infections of multi-drug resistant or other organisms transmitted by contact (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae) or droplet (e.g., influenza virus).

Consideration of these strategies assumes that:

Facilities are in communication with local public health partners such as public health emergency preparedness and response staff and sub-national and national authorities regarding identification of additional supplies.

Facilities understand their inventory and utilization rate – see: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator | CDC

Facilities have already implemented other engineering and administrative control measures for patients with COVID-19, including: Reducing or cancelling elective surgical procedures and non-critical/ non-urgent outpatient visits Reducing face-to-face healthcare worker (HCW) encounters with patients Limiting the number of visitors to healthcare facilities Cohorting patients and HCWs

Facilities have provided HCWs with required education and training, including having them demonstrate competency in donning and doffing with all PPE required for direct care of patients with COVID-19 and other job functions – see: WHO | HOW TO PUT ON AND TAKE OFF Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) external icon

Structure of the document:

This document is organized by the type of PPE indicated for use in direct clinical care of suspected or confirmed patients with COVID-19. Medical masks, gowns and eye protection are addressed within this document, due to widespread supply shortages. Respirators are only described briefly, with references to other sources of information where available. Finally, examination gloves are not addressed within this document; the use of examination gloves should always adhere to standard IPC practice.

For each type of PPE, a brief description is provided as well as operational considerations under each of several potential strategies for scenarios of:

Limited supplies: where recommended PPE for direct clinical care is still available, but the supply is insufficient to enable full adherence to standard IPC practice. Strategies to conserve supplies under this scenario include: Extended use: by one HCW among multiple patients with COVID-19 (one donning and doffing)

by one HCW among multiple patients with COVID-19 (one donning and doffing) Reuse: by one HCW among multiple patients with COVID-19 (multiple donning and doffing)

No PPE available: where recommended PPE for direct clinical care is NOT available, in the context of acute supply shortages. Strategies under this scenario include potential alternatives to recommended PPE as a last resort during a crisis where standard PPE is not available.

These strategies are generally listed according to priority for consideration; for example, extended use strategies should generally be considered prior to reuse strategies. These strategies largely mirror the temporary measures laid out in Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pdf iconexternal icon, as well as additional strategies that may be utilized in some contexts. This is an interim document and information provided will be updated as new data sources become available.

General Strategies:

Considerations in the context of limited supplies:

Using reusable PPE where options exist such as cloth gowns and reusable goggles.

If this strategy is adopted: Manufacturer’s instructions for reprocessing including cleaning and disinfecting should be followed and support staff augmented as needed to ensure that equipment is reprocessed after each use. Systems should be established to 1) routinely inspect, 2) maintain by such means as replacing missing fastening ties, and 3) replace reusable PPE when they are damaged, such as when gowns become thin or ripped (upon which time they should be disposed).



Using PPE beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life or expiration date for a limited time.

This strategy is not consistent with standard practice and therefore not recommended, but if adopted: The items should be inspected prior to use to be sure they are in good condition with no degradation, tears, or wear that could affect performance.

Medical masks (also known as surgical masks or medical facemasks): Medical masks reduce the transfer of saliva and respiratory droplets to others and help block blood and other potentially infectious materials from the skin, mouth, or nose of the wearer. Medical masks may or may not have some level of fluid-resistance and do not seal tightly to the wearer’s face. They have multiple layers of different nonwoven fabric materials, which are fused together. They are available in different thicknesses and with different ability to protect from contact with splashes and droplets. They are designed for single-use and will deteriorate with prolonged use, exposure to moisture and exposure to standard levels of disinfection such as chemicals, heat, and radiation. EU MDD Directive 93/42/EEC Category III or equivalent, EN 14683 Type II, IIR, ASTM F2100 minimum Level 1 or equivalent are indicated for use for direct clinical care of patients with COVID-19.

1) Limited Supplies

Extended use: Extending use of medical masks for one HCW to use on multiple patients with COVID-19 (multiple single-rooms when seen in succession or cohort of patients) during a single shift.

This strategy is not consistent with standard practice and therefore not recommended, but if adopted: If the mask becomes moist, damaged, visibly soiled, or difficult to breathe through it should be removed using appropriate technique and disposed following local protocols. If the mask is removed for any other reason such as taking a break or completing a shift, it should be disposed of following local protocols. The potential number of hours of extended use would be dependent on local and individual factors such as humidity and shift length. In practice, this would likely be a maximum of six hours. This emergency strategy (extended use) should be prioritized over reuse or any other approaches.



Reuse: Reprocessing and reusing medical masks for one HCW to use on multiple patients with COVID-19 for a limited time-period (multiple shifts).

This strategy is not consistent with standard practice and therefore not recommended, but if adopted: It would be important to establish standardized methods and protocols for ensuring the effectiveness of the process and that the integrity of the medical mask is maintained after reprocessing. It would be important to closely inspect the mask prior to each reuse, given that the number of times a medical mask could potentially be reprocessed is unknown, and it is expected that the masks would quickly deteriorate. Some medical masks may not be able to be reused such as those that fasten to the provider via ties (and may not be able to be undone without tearing). If the mask becomes damaged, soiled or difficult to breathe through, it should be removed from circulation and disposed following local protocols.

Note: The effectiveness of reprocessing methods to inactivate coronavirus (or other enveloped virus) on a medical mask and on preserving the integrity of the mask has not been established to date.

Note: Many potential reprocessing methods are resource-intensive and may not be feasible in many low- and middle-income countries nor at a facility-level (Darnell et al, 2004; Feldmann et al, 2019).

Many potential reprocessing methods are resource-intensive and may not be feasible in many low- and middle-income countries nor at a facility-level (Darnell et al, 2004; Feldmann et al, 2019). Note: See respirator section below for additional data on potential reprocessing methods for respirators.

2) No Medical Masks Available

Potential alternatives: Using 1) a face shield only or 2) a combination of a non-medical, approved fabric mask and face shield.

This strategy is not consistent with standard practice and therefore not recommended, but if adopted: It would be important to take into consideration the limited ability of face shields to fully protect against droplets and the lack of evidence on effectiveness of non-medical fabric masks against respiratory viruses (Institute of Medicine, 2006). Efforts should be made to obtain standardized masks made of fabrics that are approved by national or sub-national authorities and offer some level of filtration as well as a hydrophobic outer layer to allow some level of fluid resistance. Given the uncertain effect of reprocessing on the integrity of a non-medical fabric mask, the masks should be removed using appropriate technique for disposal following local protocols whenever needed such as when they become moist, visibly soiled, or damaged and upon exiting the isolation area per standard practice.

Note: Non-medical fabric masks are not considered PPE and their ability to protect HCWs is currently unknown; some studies suggest that it may lead to a false sense of protection and even increase influenza-like illness relative to wearing a medical mask (MacIntyre et al, 2015). Caution should be exercised when considering this option.

Gowns

Gowns: Non-sterile, long-sleeved hospital gowns (isolation gowns or surgical gowns) are indicated for use for direct care of patients with COVID-19. These are available in both disposable and reusable options. Disposable gowns are generally made of a spun bound synthetic material. Reusable (washable) gowns are typically made of cotton or cotton-blend fabrics; gowns made of these fabrics can be safely laundered and reused if they are in good condition.

1) Limited Supplies

Extended use: Extending the use of gowns (disposable or reusable options) for one HCW to use on multiple patients with COVID-19 (multiple single-rooms when seen in succession or cohort of patients) during a single shift.

This strategy is not consistent with standard practice and therefore not recommended, but if adopted: If it becomes visibly soiled, the gown must be removed using appropriate technique for reprocessing (See reprocessing guidance below) or disposal following local protocols (followed by appropriate donning of a new gown). If it is removed for any other reason such as taking a break or completing a shift, the gown should be sent for reprocessing or disposed of following local protocols

Note: this emergency strategy (extended use) should be prioritized over the use of alternatives.

Method Product(s) Process Additional considerations Method Commercial/ industrial laundry machines Product(s) Laundry detergents Process Follow instructions from the washer/dryer manufacturer.

2) No Gowns Available

Potential alternatives:

Disposable aprons

Disposable laboratory coats

Reusable (washable) patient gowns, reusable (washable) laboratory coats

Combinations of clothing such as sleeve covers in combination with aprons and long sleeve patient gowns or laboratory coats

This strategy is not consistent with standard practice and therefore not recommended, but if adopted: The selection of potential alternatives should take into consideration the availability of these alternatives and their attributes, such as impermeability and user comfort, and whether enough are available to allow frequent replacement. The alternatives should be removed using appropriate technique for either reprocessing or disposal following local protocols whenever needed such as when they become (e.g., when moist, visibly soiled, or damaged) and upon exiting the isolation area following standard practice.



Eye Protection

Goggles: Goggles provide barrier protection for the eyes. They should fit tightly over and around the eyes or personal prescription lenses, be indirectly vented (to prevent penetration of splashes or sprays) and have an anti-fog coating to help maintain clarity of vision. The lens is made of plastic, commonly polycarbonate, and there is an adjustable elastic strap to allow snug fit around the eyes. Goggles used for healthcare applications are typically reusable.

Face shields: Provide barrier protection to the facial area and related mucous membranes (eyes, nose, lips) and are considered an alternative to goggles. Face shields are not meant to function as primary respiratory protection and should be used concurrently with a medical mask (for droplet precautions) or a respirator (for airborne precautions) if aerosol-generating procedure is performed. They should cover the forehead, extend below the chin, and wrap around the side of the face. Face shields are available in both disposable and reusable options.

1) Limited Supplies

Extended use: Extending the use of goggles or face shields (disposable or reusable) for one HCW to use on multiple patients with COVID-19 (multiple single-rooms when seen in succession or cohort of patients) during a single shift.

This strategy is not consistent with standard practice and therefore not recommended, but if adopted: If eye protection becomes visibly soiled, it should be removed using appropriate technique and sent for reprocessing or disposal following local protocols (followed by appropriate donning of a new set of eye protection) before moving to another patient. If eye protection is removed for any other reason such as taking a break or completing a shift, it should be sent for reprocessing or disposed following local protocols.



Reuse:

Reprocessing and reusing disposable face shields for one HCW to use on multiple patients with COVID-19 for a limited time-period (multiple shifts).

This strategy is not consistent with best practices and therefore not recommended, but if adopted: A face shield should be dedicated to one HCW. They should be immediately reprocessed when they are visibly soiled, whenever they are removed such as when leaving the isolation area, and at least daily (after every shift) prior to putting them back on (See reprocessing guidance below). After reprocessing, a face shield should be stored in a transparent plastic container and labeled with the HCW name to prevent accidental sharing between HCW.

Note: The number of times a disposable face shield could potentially be reprocessed is unknown; therefore, face shields should be closely examined prior to each reuse to ensure the integrity of the foam pad, elastic strap, and clarity of the visor.

Dedicating a supply of reusable goggles or face shields to an isolation area (with one or more patients with COVID-19 in single-rooms or a cohort of patients) for multiple HCWs to use throughout one shift.

This strategy is not consistent with standard practice and therefore not recommended, but if adopted: Items should be reprocessed after each use and stored at the entry to the isolation area, in a dedicated area equipped for reprocessing adjacent to the isolation area (dirty and clean storage area) (See reprocessing guidance below).

Fully dry (air dry or use clean absorbent towels). Disinfectant Product Options Manufacturers should be consulted for their guidance and experience in disinfecting their respective products. Considerations / Additional Guidance Chlorine-based disinfectant (0.1% chlorine solution) recommended over alcohol as alcohol may damage and discolor plastic and deteriorate glues over time; note that it may also remove anti-glare and anti-fogging properties of the eye protection. Note: Solutions must be regularly replaced as they will quickly become contaminated. See guidance on how to prepare 0.1% chlorine solution.

2) No Goggles or Face Shields Available

Potential alternatives: Using safety glasses such as trauma glasses

This strategy is not consistent with standard practice and therefore not recommended, but if adopted: The selection of potential alternatives should include those that have extensions to cover the side of the eyes.



Procedure-specific PPE:

Respirators

Respirators: Provide protection against inhalation of very small infectious airborne particulates using a filtering facepiece respirator (FFR). N95, FFP2, P2 or equivalent standard particulate respirators are indicated for use in patients with COVID-19.

How Public Health Laboratories Order the Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay

CDC’s International Reagent Resource (IRR) is working through the main Public Health Laboratory (PHL) in each state to allocate multiplex kits to their state’s network of regional and local PHLs.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, state public health laboratories can authorize county or city laboratories in their state to perform testing. These laboratories must be certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) to perform high- and/or moderate-complexity tests, have appropriate laboratory equipment and training, and demonstrate testing proficiency under their state laboratory’s stewardship to maintain their status as an IRR-registered laboratory. The IRR does not supply clinicians, hospitals, or healthcare professionals with testing kits directly. A list of commercially available primers and probes for use with this test is not available at this time. However, CDC has shared the primers and probes sequences, so other laboratories and companies may manufacture their own reagents.

Materials included in the assay

The CDC Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay is a quadruplex assay that includes:

One primer mix and one probe mix. Primers and probes target: Virus nucleocapsid (N) gene for specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 Matrix (M1) gene for specific detection of influenza A virus Nonstructural 2 (NS2) gene for specific detection of influenza B virus RNase P gene (RP) for specific detection of human nucleic acid that serves as an internal control

Calculating SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), laboratory data from public health laboratories, U.S. hospital laboratories, private and commercial laboratories, some large chain drug stores, and other testing entities are reported to state and local health departments. Laboratory data are reported to state and local health departments in accordance with applicable state or local law and transmitted to CDC in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (CARES Act Section 18115pdf iconexternal icon). De-identified COVID-19 laboratory data from 6 large commercial and public health laboratories are also reported directly to CDC. Hospital laboratories in states that are not yet sending line-level data to CDC report data directly to the Department of Health and Human Services. These entities voluntarily submit electronic files of COVID-19 de-identified laboratory data to CDC or HHS on a daily or periodic basis. At CDC and HHS, the data are processed and analyzed, with the results made available for federal response efforts (in HHS Protect). Laboratory data provided to CDC is made publicly available on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker website in a way that protects the privacy of individuals and can be downloaded for analysis from healthdata.govexternal icon.

Using Percent Positivity Calculation for Public Health Surveillance

The formula for calculating percent positivity used by CDC is the number of positive tests (numerator) divided by the total number of resulted reported tests (denominator): (positive/total) x 100% where the total equals positive plus negative test results and excludes indeterminate results.

In general, for federal COVID-19 response reporting purposes, laboratory test percent positivity has represented the percentage of all RT-PCR tests conducted that are positive. Although the methods used by different organizations to calculate percent positivity can differ (see below), percent positivity has provided insights into transmission of infectious diseases, including COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), in a geographical area (e.g., national, regional, state, county). The interpretation of percent positivity depends on the volume of COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory testing reported to state and local health departments and the criteria used for determining what populations are tested (routine screening of asymptomatic persons vs diagnostic testing of symptomatic persons or case contacts).

A high COVID-19 RT-PCR percent positivity occurs when many of the test results among those being tested and reported in a community are positive. This can mean that

there are widespread infections in the community tested; or

only a subset of the community at greatest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection is being tested; or

there are reporting processes or delays that skew the results (e.g., prioritizing reporting of positive test results over negative results).

The laboratory test percent positive goes down when more people tested are negative. This happens when the number of infections goes down (the numerator gets smaller), or testing is expanded to more people who are not infected (the denominator is larger without uncovering a lot of new infections). In general, percent positivity will go down as more persons are being screened in non-outbreak settings (e.g., routine screening in schools, long-term care facilities, workplaces) and the results are reported. Expanded testing does not always reduce the percent positive when there is widespread transmission; it may reveal more people who are infected.

Different Methods Used to Calculate Percent Positivity

CDC, state, and jurisdictional health departments may calculate percent positivity differently, which may include:

Differences in the numerators or denominators used (e.g., tests/tests, people/tests, people/people). State and jurisdictional health departments have access to personal identifiers in their datasets and can identify and de-duplicate persons with multiple positive tests whereas CDC is unable to perform this function.

(See Figure 1 below.)

(See Figure 1 below.) Differences in the timeframe in which data are included (i.e., a seven-day verses a 14-day rolling average), as well as what dates (e.g. specimen collection date, test date, result date) are used to assign tests to specific timeframes.

Differences in the inclusion or exclusion of antigen test results. Antigen tests may be used for screening or diagnostic purposes. Positive test results for COVID-19 antigen are considered a probable case as outlined in the CSTE position statement, and might not be confirmed using FDA authorized RT-PCR tests for COVID-19. Antigen test results might not be consistently reported to public health by clinics or sites where routine screening is conducted (e.g., long-term care facilities, schools or workplaces).

Differences in inclusion of screening tests results. With increased screening using both antigen and RT-PCR tests, the ability to confidently interpret the meaning of percent positivity results will be impacted by the unknown criteria for testing (routine screening versus diagnostic testing of symptomatic persons).

Differences in how test results are assigned to jurisdictions, including by the person’s place of residence, the provider’s clinic location, the location the test specimen was collected, or the location of the laboratory.

Figure 1: Three ways in which percent positivity can be calculated for COVID-19 laboratory tests

Read Text Equivalent (for Section 508 access).

CDC Methods for Calculating Percent Positivity

Currently, for federal reporting purposes, CDC defines percent positivity as the number of COVID-19 positive RT-PCR tests as the numerator (includes diagnostic tests and screening tests, when analyzed at CLIA-certified laboratories), divided by the total number of RT-PCR tests with positive and negative results as the denominator: (positive tests/total tests) x 100% (Method 1 in the figure above). This excludes antigen tests, antibody tests, and RT-PCR tests conducted by non-CLIA laboratories for surveillance purposes. Data received at the federal level are de-identified and, therefore, are not able to be linked at the person level for de-duplication. This prevents CDC use of methods 2 (people over test) and 3 (people over people) in Figure 1 above.

Resulted tests in data provided to CDC by states and local health departments are assigned to a 7-day timeframe based on the top test-related date available in the data according to the following hierarchy:

Test date (day the laboratory had a test result) Result date (day the laboratory sent the result to the requestor) Specimen received date (day accessioned by lab) Specimen collection date (day specimen collected from patient)

Test results are assigned to a geography based on a hierarchy of test-related locations:

Patient location Provider facility location Ordering facility location Performing organization location

Conclusions",2/11/20 0:00,
Guidance for General Laboratory Safety Practices during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"General Guidance

This guidance is to address the general workflow safety concerns of laboratory personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. All laboratories should perform site- and activity-specific risk assessments to determine the most appropriate safety measures to implement for particular circumstances. In addition, facilities should adhere to local policies and procedures as well as all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and public health guidelines.

Risk assessments should include the following considerations:

Analyze the number of people that the laboratory space can realistically and safely accommodate while maintaining social distancing .

Assess the flow of personnel traffic. Where possible, design one-way paths for staff to walk through the laboratory space.

Assess procedures for cleaning and sanitizing commonly shared equipment and areas—for example, counters, benchtops, and desks—to ensure clean surfaces and equipment for all users.

Review emergency communication and operational plans, including how to protect staff at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Every institution should have a COVID-19 health and safety plan to protect employees. This plan should be shared with all staff. Ideally, this plan would:

Describe steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if an employee is sick.

Instruct sick employees to stay home and not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met , in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.

in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments. Provide information on whom employees should contact if they become sick.

Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. If sick leave is not offered to some or all employees, the institution should consider implementing emergency sick leave policies.

Designate someone to be responsible for responding to employees’ COVID-19 concerns. Employees should know who this person is and how to contact this person at all times.

Provide employees with accurate information about COVID-19, how it spreads, and the risk of exposure.

Reinforce training on proper handwashing practices and other routine infection control precautions to help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.

Ensure that employees have access to personal protective equipment (PPE); disinfectant products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon; and soap, clean running water, and drying materials for handwashing, or alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol.

Social Distancing

To the extent possible, adhere to social distancing recommendations by adjusting staff schedules, adding additional shifts, or implementing non-overlapping teams to minimize personnel contact. Identify laboratory tasks and activities that can be performed with reduced or no face-to-face interactions. Examples include limiting the number of laboratory meetings that occur and, when possible, using remote collaboration tools (such as video and phone conferencing), even for those who work in the same location or building.

To the extent possible, reconfigure workspaces and locations of shared equipment to reduce crowding. Create one-directional paths and workflows. Declutter workspaces and dispose of unnecessary items to help with reconfiguration. If reconfiguration is not possible, consider placing barriers (plexiglass, partition, plastic, etc.) between computer workstations, desks, or equipment that position staff six feet apart from each other.

Minimize personnel traffic and interactions by limiting visits from vendors and other external partners; engage with them virtually whenever possible.

Face Coverings

To help slow the spread of COVID-19, CDC recommends wearing face coverings in settings where social distancing measures are challenging to maintain, like office spaces, computer workstations, and break rooms. In general, laboratory employees should wear a face covering in laboratory spaces that do not have requirements for respiratory PPE and where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Any face covering that is worn inside a laboratory area where personnel work with potentially infectious material should subsequently not be worn outside of that laboratory area. Laboratory PPE are critical supplies, and employees should refrain from removing them from the laboratory for general use. Site- and activity-specific risk assessments, as well as available resources, should determine where specific facial protection, such as disposable masks, should be used.

These face coverings should not be used in place of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE).

Face coverings are not intended to protect those who wear them and are not considered PPE.

All staff should follow established PPE requirements for working in laboratory spaces.

Wash hands before putting on face coverings and minimize the removal while in the laboratory. The guidance below describes how to remove a face covering and replace it with a clean face covering:

Take off the face covering carefully.

Be careful not to touch eyes, nose, or mouth when removing a face covering.

Untie the strings behind the head or stretch the ear loops.

Handle only by the ear loops or ties.

Place reusable cloth face coverings in a bag and close the bag until it can be washed. Cloth face coverings should be washed frequently. Staff are responsible for maintaining and cleaning their cloth face coverings.

Wash hands immediately after removing.

Depending on the facility’s design or configuration, additional physical barriers, such as a face shield, plexiglass, partition, or plastic barriers, may be needed to achieve social distancing goals.

Personal Hygiene and Disinfection

As more workers return to the laboratory, extra measures may be needed to ensure a clean and appropriate environment. Reevaluate current protocols for cleaning, use of PPE, and handwashing. High-touch locations and equipment with a high frequency of handling and contact present a higher probability of contamination in the work area and should be disinfected frequently. Increasing the number of available cleaning supplies and distributing them throughout the laboratory can encourage staff to more frequently clean surfaces and equipment.

Use visual reminders, such as posters displayed throughout the laboratory environment, common areas, and restrooms, to emphasize the importance of hand hygiene and to encourage frequent handwashing. Hands should be washed regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol can be used when soap and water are not available.

Interim Guidance for Rapid Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2,"Note: Antigen tests can be used in a variety of testing strategies to respond to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This interim guidance is intended for clinicians who order antigen tests, receive antigen test results, and/or perform point of care testing, as well as for laboratory professionals who perform antigen testing in a laboratory setting or at the point of care and report those results. The purpose of this interim technical guidance is to support effective use of antigen tests for different testing situations. This guidance applies to all uses of antigen tests and is not specific to any particular age group or setting. This guidance supplements and is consistent with CDC’s Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2 guidance. CDC has also provided a summary of considerations for using antigen tests in nursing home facilities.

Definitions of Diagnostic, Screening, and Surveillance Testing for SARS-CoV-2

Table 1 summarizes the differences between diagnostic, screening, and surveillance testing.

Definition of Diagnostic Testing

Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to identify current infection in individuals and is performed when a person has signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or when a person is asymptomaticexternal icon but has recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Examples of diagnostic testing include testing symptomatic persons, testing persons identified through contact tracing efforts, and testing those who indicate that they were exposed to someone with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. See CDC’s Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2. The US. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also address diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Definition of Screening Testing

Screening testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to identify infected persons who are asymptomatic and without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Screening testing is performed to identify persons who may be contagious so that measures can be taken to prevent further transmission. Examples of screening include testing in congregate settings, such as a long-term care facility or a correctional facility, a workplace testing its employees, or a school testing its students, faculty, and staff. See CDC’s Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2, Testing Guidelines for Nursing Homes, Interim Considerations for K-12 School Administrators for SARS-CoV-2 Testing, Considerations for Non-Healthcare Workplaces, and Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities. FDA’s FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also address screening testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Definition of Surveillance Testing

Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice. See CDC’s Introduction to Public Health Surveillance. Surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to monitor for a community- or population-level infection and disease, or to characterize the incidence and prevalence of disease. Surveillance testing is used to gain information at a population level, rather than an individual level, and results of surveillance testing are only returned in aggregate to the requesting institution. Surveillance testing is performed on de-identified specimens, and thus results are not linked to individuals. Surveillance testing does not involve returning a diagnostic test result to an individual, or for individual decision-making. An example of surveillance testing is a plan developed by a state public health department to randomly select and sample a percentage of all persons in a city on a rolling basis to assess local infection rates and trends. See CDC’s Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2. FDA’s FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also addresses surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Rapid Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2

General Guidance

Rapid antigen tests are commonly used in the diagnosis of respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The FDA has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for antigen tests that can identify SARS-CoV-2. See FDA’s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon.

Antigen tests are immunoassays that detect the presence of a specific viral antigen, which implies current viral infection. Antigen tests are currently authorized to be performed on nasopharyngeal or nasal swab specimens placed directly into the assay’s extraction buffer or reagent. The currently authorized antigen tests are not restricted to use on persons of a certain age. See Table 2 for additional information about antigen tests.

Antigen tests are relatively inexpensive and can be used at the point-of-care. The currently authorized devices return results in approximately 15 minutes. Antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are generally less sensitive than viral tests that detect nucleic acid using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). See FDA’s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon for more information about the performance of specific authorized tests. Proper interpretation of antigen test results is important for accurate clinical management of patients with suspected COVID-19, or for identification of potentially infected persons when used for screening.

The clinical performance of rapid antigen diagnostic tests largely depends on the circumstances in which they are used. Rapid antigen tests perform best when the person is tested in the early stages of infection with SARS-CoV-2 when viral load is generally highest. They also may be informative in diagnostic testing situations in which the person has a known exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19. Rapid antigen tests can be used for screening testing in high-risk congregate settings in which repeat testing could quickly identify persons with a SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform infection prevention and control measures, thus preventing transmission. In this case, there may be value in providing immediate results with antigen tests even though they may have lower sensitivity than RT-PCR tests, especially in settings where a rapid turnaround time is required. See FDA’s FAQs on screening asymptomatic individuals and use of antigen tests in high risk congregate settingsexternal icon.

There are limited data to guide the use of rapid antigen tests as screening tests on asymptomatic persons to detect or exclude COVID-19, or to determine whether a previously confirmed case is still infectious.

Clinicians should understand antigen test performance characteristics in order to recognize potentially false negative or false positive results and to guide patient management. Laboratory and testing professionals who perform rapid antigen tests should also understand the factors that affect the accuracy of antigen testing, as described in this guidance.

Regulatory Requirements for Using Rapid Antigen Tests for SARS-CoV-2

FDA regulates in vitro diagnostic devices and has provided recommendations and information regarding EUA requests for COVID-19 diagnostic tests in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised) (“Policy for COVID-19 Tests”)external icon and the EUA templates referenced in that policy. COVID-19 assays and test systems used for diagnostic or screening testing, including those for antigen testing, must have received an EUA from FDA or be offered under the policies in FDA’s Policy for COVID-19 Testsexternal icon. Any rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 authorized for use by FDA will be included on FDA’s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon.

Laboratory and testing professionals who conduct diagnostic or screening testing for SARS-CoV-2 with rapid antigen tests must also comply with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations. Any laboratory or testing site that intends to report patient-specific test results must first obtain a CLIA certificate and meet all requirements to perform that testing. For more information, see the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service’s (CMS) summary of the CLIA regulationspdf iconexternal icon. CMS has provided additional information on enforcement discretion for the use of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care antigen tests on asymptomatic individuals on its websitepdf iconexternal icon.

Laboratory and testing professionals who conduct surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 with rapid antigen tests are not obligated to comply with these FDA and CLIA requirements. However, CDC recommends that facilities that conduct surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 with antigen tests should use an antigen test that has been authorized for use, which are listed on FDA’s In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon. Information on surveillance testing performed by Universitiespdf iconexternal icon may be found on the CMS website.

Collection and Handling of Clinical Specimens

All testing for SARS-CoV-2, including rapid antigen testing, is directly impacted by the integrity of the specimen, which depends on specimen collection and handling. Improper specimen collection may cause some swabs to have limited amounts of viral genetic or antigenic material for detection. Inadequate quality assurance procedures could result in cross contamination of the specimen, which could cause inaccurate test results. Delays from sample collection to testing should be minimized. Biosafety measures and instructions for use should be followed precisely to ensure accurate testing and safety of those who perform the testing. See CDC’s guidance on Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for COVID-19.

Some antigen assays have explored the use of viral transport media, but the introduction of this dilution may decrease the sensitivity of the assay and carries the risk of cross contamination that can cause false-positive results. Laboratories and testing sites should follow the instructions for use and the package insert that are specific for the test system that they are using.

Performance of Rapid Antigen Tests for SARS-CoV-2

It is important for clinicians and testing personnel to understand the performance characteristics, including analytic sensitivity and specificity, of the particular rapid antigen test being used, and to follow the manufacturer’s instructions and package insert.

The “gold standard” for clinical diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 remains RT-PCR. Thus, it may be necessary to confirm a rapid antigen test result with a nucleic acid test, especially if the result of the antigen test is inconsistent with the clinical context. When confirming an antigen test result with a RT-PCR test, it is important that the time interval between collection of samples for the two tests is less than two days, and there have not been any opportunities for new exposures between them. If more than two days separate the two collections, or if there have been opportunities for new exposures, the nucleic acid test should be considered a separate test – not a confirmatory test. Table 2 summarizes the differences between RT-PCR tests and antigen tests.

The sensitivity of rapid antigen tests is generally lower than RT-PCR. The first antigen tests to have received FDA EUAs demonstrate sensitivity ranging from 84.0%-97.6% compared to RT-PCR. Antigen levels in specimens collected beyond 5-7 days of the onset of symptoms may drop below the limit of detection of the test. This may result in a negative test result, while a more sensitive test, such as RT-PCR, may return a positive result.

The specificity of rapid antigen tests is generally as high as RT-PCR – the first antigen tests that have received FDA EUAs have reported specificity of 100% – which means that false positive results are unlikely. Positive and negative predictive values of all in vitro diagnostic tests vary depending upon the pretest probability of the patient being tested. Pretest probability is impacted by the prevalence of the target infection in the community as well as the clinical context of the recipient of the test. Table 3 provides additional information on the relationship between pretest probability and the likelihood of positive and negative predictive values.

CDC recommends that laboratory and testing professionals who perform rapid antigen testing should determine infection prevalence based on a rolling average of the positivity rate of their own SARS-CoV-2 testing over the previous 7–10 days. Infection prevalence at the time of testing, as well as the clinical context of the recipient of the test, impacts pretest probability. If a specific testing site, such as a nursing home, has a positivity rate near zero, the prevalence of disease in the community (e.g., cases per population) should instead be used to help determine pretest probability. Rapid antigen tests should be interpreted in the context of the prevalence of infection or disease, the device’s performance characteristics and instructions for use, and the patient’s clinical signs, symptoms, and history.

Evaluating the Results of Rapid Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2

Evaluating the results of a rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 should take into account the performance characteristics (e.g. sensitivity, specificity), instructions for use of the FDA-authorized assay, the prevalence of COVID-19 in that particular community (positivity rate over the previous 7-10 days or cases per population), and the clinical and epidemiological context of the person who has been tested.

The evaluation of a diagnostic antigen test result should consider the length of time the patient has experienced symptoms. Generally, clinicians can rely upon a positive diagnostic antigen test result because the specificity of current FDA-authorized antigen tests is high in a person who has COVID-19 symptoms.

The sensitivity of current FDA-authorized antigen tests varies, and thus negative diagnostic testing results should be handled differently depending on the testing device and its stated performance characteristics. In most cases, negative antigen diagnostic test results are considered presumptive. CDC recommends confirming negative antigen test results with an RT-PCR test when the pretest probability is relatively high, especially if the patient is symptomatic or has a known exposure to a person confirmed to have COVID-19. Ideally, confirmatory RT-PCR testing should take place within two days of the initial antigen testing. If RT-PCR testing is not available, clinical discretion can be used in whether to recommend the patient isolate. See CDC’s guidance on Quarantine and Isolation, Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings, Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions of Patients in Healthcare Settings, and Return to Work for Healthcare Personnel. CDC does not recommend using antigen tests to make decisions about discontinuing isolation.

Currently, the rapid antigen tests that have received EUAs from FDA are authorized for diagnostic testing on symptomatic persons within the first five to twelve days of symptom onset. See FDA’s In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon in addition to information from CMS on enforcement discretion for the use of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care antigen diagnostic testing on asymptomatic individualspdf iconexternal icon. Serial antigen testing within a closed congregate setting, such as a long-term care facility or a correctional facility, could quickly identify someone with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevent further transmission. Modeling evidenceexternal icon shows that outbreak control depends largely on the frequency of testing and the speed of reporting and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. For this reason, serial antigen testing may have benefits for early identification and controlling outbreaks in some situations, such as congregate living, compared to RT-PCR tests in settings with prolonged turnaround times. See FDA’s FAQ on use of antigen tests in high risk congregate settingsexternal icon.

When used for screening testing in congregate settings, test results for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered presumptive. Confirmatory nucleic acid testing following a positive antigen test may not be necessary when the pretest probability is high, especially if the person is symptomatic or has a known exposure. When the pretest probability is low, those persons who receive a positive antigen test should isolate until they can be confirmed by RT-PCR. See CDC’s Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings, Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions of Patients in Healthcare Settings, and Return to Work for Healthcare Personnel.

Confirmatory nucleic acid testing following a negative antigen test used for screening testing may not be necessary if the pretest probability is low, the person is asymptomatic, or has no known exposures, or is part of a cohort that will receive rapid antigen tests on a recurring basis. Nucleic acid testing is also considered presumptive when screening asymptomatic persons, the potential benefits of confirmatory testing should be carefully considered in the context of person’s clinical presentation.

CDC will update this guidance as more data become available.

Reporting Rapid Antigen Test Results for SARS-CoV-2 to Health Departments and Patients

A CLIA-certified laboratory or testing site must report rapid antigen diagnostic test results to the local, state, tribal, or territory health department in accordance with Public Law 116-136, § 18115(a), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which requires “every laboratory that performs or analyzes a test that is intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19” to report the results of each such test. Antigen test results that are reported to public health departments must be clearly distinguished from other COVID-19 tests, such as RT-PCR tests and antibody tests.

On June 4, 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services published guidance on COVID-19 Pandemic Response, Laboratory Data Reporting: CARES Act Section 18115pdf iconexternal icon that specifies what additional data should be collected and electronically reported to health departments along with COVID-19 diagnostic or screening test results. Laboratory and testing professionals should collect and report complete patient demographic information and ensure that they report antigen test results using the proper LOINC code for their particular FDA-authorized assay(s). Facilities should refer to CDC’s LOINC In Vitro Diagnostic (LIVD) Test Code Mapping for SARS-CoV-2 Tests.

A CLIA-certified laboratory or testing site must report antigen test results to the individual or the individual’s healthcare provider according to the instructions for use of the FDA-authorized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic device that was used. Depending on the stipulations of the FDA authorization, the laboratory or testing site may be required to report negative test results to patients as “presumptive negative.”

Laboratories that are either CLIA-certified or non CLIA-certified may conduct surveillance testing. Results of surveillance testing that uses rapid antigen tests can be returned in aggregate to the requesting institution, such as a university or public health agency. Negative antigen surveillance test results should be reported as “presumptive negative” to the requesting institution. Laboratories, regardless of their CLIA status, should not officially report the results of surveillance testing to health departments. If a local, state, tribal, or territory health department requests access to the results of surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 that uses antigen testing, the laboratory should state in the report to the health department that the data are antigen surveillance testing results that do not represent COVID-19 diagnostic or screening test results.

Laboratories that conduct surveillance testing, including surveillance testing that uses antigen tests, should not report test results to persons whose specimens have been tested, or to their health-care provider, employer, etc. Surveillance testing is performed on de-identified specimens, and thus results are not linked to an individual person. If at any time a laboratory intends to report a patient-specific test result, it must first obtain a CLIA certificate and meet all requirements to perform testing. For more information, see CMS’s summary of the CLIA regulationspdf iconexternal icon.

Interim Guidelines for COVID-19 Antibody Testing,"Data that will inform antibody testing (also referred to as serologic testing) guidance are rapidly evolving. Recommendations on the use of serologic tests to determine protective immunity and infectiousness among persons recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be updated as new information becomes available.

Summary

Serologic methods have important public health and clinical uses for monitoring and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2 have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has independently reviewed their performance.

Currently, there is no identified advantage whether the assays test for IgG, IgM and IgG, or total antibody.

It is important to minimize false-positive test results by choosing an assay with high specificity and by testing populations and individuals with an elevated likelihood of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, an orthogonal testing algorithm (i.e., employing two independent tests in sequence when the first test yields a positive result) can be used when the expected positive predictive value of a single test is low.

Antibodies most commonly become detectable 1–3 weeks after symptom onset, at which time evidence suggests that infectiousness likely is greatly decreased and that some degree of immunity from future infection has developed. However, additional data are needed before modifying public health recommendations based on serologic test results, including decisions on discontinuing physical distancing and using personal protective equipment.

Background

Serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2, now broadly available, can play an important role in understanding the virus’s epidemiology in the general population and identifying groups at higher risk for infection. Unlike direct detection methods such as viral nucleic acid amplification or antigen detection tests that can detect acutely infected persons, antibody tests help determine whether the individual being tested was previously infected—even if that person never showed symptoms. Serologic tests detect resolving or past SARS-CoV-2 virus infection indirectly by measuring the person’s humoral immune response to the virus. Therefore, serologic assays do not typically replace direct detection methods as the primary tool for diagnosing an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they do have several important applications in monitoring and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although serologic tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune, these tests can help determine the proportion of a population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provide information about populations that may be immune and potentially protected. Thus, demographic and geographic patterns of serologic test results can help determine which communities may have experienced a higher infection rate and therefore may have a higher proportion of the population with some degree of immunity, at least temporarily. In some instances, serologic test results may assist with identifying persons potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2 and determining who may qualify to donate blood that can be used to manufacture convalescent plasmaexternal icon as a possible treatment for those who are seriously ill from COVID-19.

Development of Antibodies and Immunity

Nearly all immune-competent individuals will develop an immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like infections with other pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits development of IgM and IgG antibodies, which are the most useful for assessing antibody response because little is known about IgA response in the blood.

Antibodies in some persons can be detected within the first week of illness onset. In SARS-CoV-2 infections, IgM and IgG antibodies can arise nearly simultaneously in serum within 2 to 3 weeks after illness onset. Thus, detection of IgM without IgG is uncommon. How long IgM and IgG antibodies remain detectable following infection is not known. It is also important to note that some persons do not develop detectable IgG or IgM antibodies following infection. Thus, the absence of detectable IgM or IgG antibodies does not necessarily rule out that they could have previously been infected.

In addition, development of neutralizing antibodies can also be assessed. Neutralizing antibodies inhibit viral replication in vitro, and as with many infectious diseases, their presence correlates with immunity to future infection, at least temporarily.

Recurrence of COVID-19 illness appears to be very uncommon, suggesting that the presence of antibodies could indicate at least short-term immunity to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with this observation, experimental primary infection in primates and subsequent development of antibodies resulted in protection from reinfection after the primates were rechallenged. Additionally, antibody development in humans correlates with a marked decrease in viral load in the respiratory tract. Taken together, these observations suggest that the presence of antibodies may decrease a person’s infectiousness and offer some level of protection from reinfection. However, it remains uncertain to what degree and for how long individuals with antibodies (neutralizing or total) are protected against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 or what concentration of antibodies may be needed to provide such protection.

Current Status of Antibody Testing in the United States

Antigenic targets

The two major antigenic targets of SARS-CoV-2 virus against which antibodies are detected are spike glycoprotein (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N). While S protein is essential for virus entry and is present on the viral surface, N protein is the most abundantly expressed immunodominant protein that interacts with RNA. Multiple forms of S protein—full-length (S1+S2) or partial (S1 domain or receptor binding domain [RBD])—are used as antigens. The protein target determines cross-reactivity and specificity because N is more conserved across coronaviruses than S, and within S, RBD is more conserved than S1 or full-length S.

Types of Antibody Testing

Different types of assays can be used to determine different aspects of immune response and functionality of antibodies. The tests can be broadly classified to detect either binding or neutralizing antibodies.

Binding antibody detection : These tests use purified proteins of SARS-CoV-2, not live virus, and can be performed in lower biosafety level laboratories (e.g., BSL-2). With specific reagents, individual antibody types, like IgG, IgM, and IgA, can be determined. Although scientists do not know how long antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected, for most other infections, IgM is most useful for determining recent infection as it usually becomes undetectable weeks to months following infection, while IgG may remain detectable for months or years. IgA is important for mucosal immunity and can be detected in mucous secretions like saliva in addition to blood, though its significance in this disease is still to be determined. Depending on the complexity of assays, these tests can be performed rapidly (in less than 30 minutes) in a field setting or in a few hours in a laboratory.Tests that detect binding antibodies fall into two broad categories. Point-of-care (POC) tests generally are lateral flow devices that detect IgG, IgG and IgM, or total antibody in serum, plasma, whole blood, and/or saliva. An advantage of some point-of-care tests using whole blood is that they can be performed on blood samples obtained by fingerstick rather than venipuncture. Laboratory tests use ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or CIA (chemiluminescent immunoassay) methods for antibody detection, which for some assays may require trained laboratorians and specialized instruments. Based on the reagents, IgG, IgM, and IgA can be detected separately or combined as total antibody. Surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNT) have also been developed. These are binding antibody tests designed to detect potential neutralizing antibodies, often those that prevent interaction of RBD with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, the cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2). Because these tests do not require live virus, they can be conducted in BSL-2 laboratories.

Neutralizing antibody detection : FDA has not yet authorized the use of neutralization tests for SARS-CoV-2. Neutralization tests determine the functional ability of antibodies to prevent infection of virus in vitro. The tests involve incubating serum or plasma with live virus followed by infection and incubation of cells. Testing will require either BSL-3 or BSL-2 laboratories, depending on what form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is used.Two types of neutralization tests are conducted. Virus neutralization tests (VNT) , such as the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and microneutralization, use a SARS-CoV-2 virus from a clinical isolate or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter proteins. This testing requires BSL-3 laboratories and may take up to 5 days to complete. Pseudovirus neutralization tests (pVNT) use recombinant pseudoviruses (like vesicular stomatitis virus, VSV) that incorporate the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. This testing can be performed in BSL-2 laboratories depending on the VSV strain used.

FDA-authorized serologic tests

Use the FDA Calculatorpdf icon to select a COVID-19 Antibody Test for your community.

FDA now requires commercially marketed serologic tests to receive Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)external icon. Tests that are not commercially marketed do not require FDA authorization, but developers may voluntarily request authorization. Multiple agencies—including FDA, the National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health (NCI/NIH), CDC, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)—are collaborating with members of academia and the medical community to evaluate several serology tests using a well-characterized set of clinical samples (serum or plasma) collected before and during the current COVID-19 outbreak. A list of all tests authorized for emergency use under EUA is maintained on an FDA websiteexternal icon. All currently authorized tests are qualitative (providing a result that is positive, negative, or indeterminate) rather than quantitative (providing a quantitative assessment of antibody levels).

Both laboratory and rapid serologic assays have received EUA. Serologic testing technologies include single-use, low-throughput lateral flow tests where the presence of antibody is demonstrated by a color change on a paper strip and laboratory-based immunoassays that allow for processing of many samples at the same time.

The EUA letter of authorization includes the settings in which the test is authorized, based on FDA’s determination of appropriate settings for use during the public health emergency.

Optimizing Testing Outcomes

Test performance

The utility of tests depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays; these performance characteristics are determined by using a defined set of negative and positive samples. In addition, the predictive values of a test should be considered because these values affect the overall outcome of testing. Positive predictive value is the probability that individuals with positive test results are truly antibody positive. Negative predictive value is the probability that individuals with negative test results are truly antibody negative. Positive and negative predictive values are determined by the percentage of truly antibody positive individuals in the tested population (prevalence, pre-test probability) and the sensitivity and specificity of the test. For example:

In a high-prevalence setting, the positive predictive value increases—meaning it is more likely that persons who test positive are truly antibody positive—than if the test is performed in a population with low prevalence. When a test is used in a population where prevalence is low, the positive predictive value drops because there are more false-positive results, since the pre-test probability is low.

Likewise, negative predictive value is also affected by prevalence. In a high-prevalence setting, the negative predictive value declines whereas in a low-prevalence setting, it increases.

In most of the country, including areas that have been heavily impacted by COVID-19, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody is expected to be low, ranging from <5% to 25%, so that testing at this point might result in relatively more false-positive results and fewer false-negative results.

In some settings, such as COVID-19 outbreaks in food processing plants and congregate living facilities, the prevalence of infection in the population may be significantly higher. In such settings, serologic testing at appropriate intervals following outbreaks might result in relatively fewer false-positive results and more false-negative results.

Testing strategies

In the current pandemic, maximizing specificity and thus positive predictive value in a serologic algorithm is preferred in most instances, since the overall prevalence of antibodies in most populations is likely low. For example, in a population where the prevalence is 5%, a test with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity will yield a positive predictive value of 49%. In other words, less than half of those testing positive will truly have antibodies. Alternatively, the same test in a population with an antibody prevalence exceeding 52% will yield a positive predictive value greater than 95%, meaning that fewer than one in 20 people testing positive will have a false-positive test result.

Three strategies can be used to improve positive predictive value:

Choosing a test with a very high specificity, perhaps 99.5% or greater, will yield a high positive predictive value in populations tested with low prevalence; however, the positive predictive value will show some variation based on the population prevalence with a single test strategy. Table 1 presents the positive predictive value for hypothetical populations with various SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalences using a test with 90% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity.

Another strategy is to focus testing on persons with a high pre-test probability of having SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, such as persons with a history of COVID-19-like illness.

A third approach is to employ an orthogonal testing algorithm in which persons who initially test positive are tested with a second test. Effective orthogonal algorithms are generally based on testing a patient sample with two tests, each with unique design characteristics (e.g., antigens or formats).

Several testsexternal icon are available with specificities of 99.5% or greater. Because specificity may vary according to the panel of specimens collected, FDA, NIH, and CDC have conducted an independent evaluationexternal icon of some tests using a standard panel of specimens. Specificities of at least 99.5% are required to achieve a high positive predictive value in low-prevalence populations (Table 1). Tests with lower specificity, for example a specificity of 95%, will result in suboptimal positive predictive values when used in low-prevalence populations. In this situation, orthogonal testing algorithms can be designed to maximize overall specificity while retaining maximum sensitivity.

The performance of orthogonal testing algorithms has not been systematically evaluated but can be estimated using an online calculatorexternal icon from FDA. See Table 2 for the potential improvement benefits of the orthogonal testing algorithm. The type of antigen and the Ig class of both tests in an orthogonal testing algorithm should be considered when interpreting test results. For example, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop an immune response that is heavily biased towards a particular viral protein (e.g., spike protein). This scenario may result in discordant test results if the detection antigens in the first and second tests were spike protein and nucleoprotein, respectively. Similarly, the temporal dynamics of virus-specific IgM and IgG immune responses may differ following infection. In this scenario, using tests that detect different Ig classes (total Ig, IgM or IgG) may lead to discordant results.

Limitations of Serologic Tests

At present, the immunologic correlates of immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection are not well defined. Representatives from BARDA, CDC, FDA, NIH, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Department of Defense (DoD), and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) are working with members of academia and the medical community to determine whether positive serologic tests are indicative of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. This work includes assessing the level of antibodies required for protection from reinfection, the duration of that protection, and the factors associated with development of a protective antibody response. The kinetics of antibody response, longevity of antibodies, the ability of antibodies to protect from repeat infection, the protective titer of neutralizing antibody, and the correlation of binding antibody titers to neutralization ability are yet to be determined. Although animal challenge studies demonstrate protection in the short run, demonstration of long-term protection in humans will require future study. Hence, pending additional data, the presence of antibodies cannot be equated with an individual’s immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Some tests may exhibit cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses, such as those that cause the common cold. This could result in false-positive test results. Some persons may not develop detectable antibodies after coronavirus infection. In others, it is possible that antibody levels could wane over time to undetectable levels. IgM and IgG antibodies may take 1 to 3 weeks to develop after infection. Thus, serologic test results do not indicate with certainty the presence or absence of current or previous infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Recommendations for Use of Serologic Tests

Information that might impact serologic recommendations is rapidly evolving, particularly evidence of whether positive serologic tests indicate protective immunity or decreased transmissibility among those recently ill. These recommendations will be updated as new information becomes available.

Choice of test and testing strategy

Serologic assays that have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) are preferred for public health or clinical use since their test performance data have been reviewed by FDA.

Serologic test results should be interpreted in the context of the expected predictive values, positive and negative.

Positive predictive value should be optimized, particularly if results are returned to individuals, in the following ways: Assure a high positive predictive value (e.g., 95%) by choosing tests with sufficiently high specificity (e.g., > 99.5%) and testing persons or populations with a high pre-test probability of having antibodies (e.g., persons with a history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or who are exposed to areas or institutions experiencing outbreaks), OR If a high positive predictive value cannot be assured with a single test, use an orthogonal testing algorithm. See Table 2 for examples of using one or two tests in populations with various prevalences of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Currently, there is no substantive performance advantage of assays whether they test for IgG, IgM and IgG, or total antibody. Thus, immunoglobulin class should not determine the assay chosen in most circumstances. The detection of IgM antibodies may indicate a more recent infection, but the dynamics of the IgM antibody response are not well defined at present. Over time, it may be important to characterize and evaluate the performance of assays in samples that are IgM negative and IgG positive to ensure that assays remain fit for purpose in population studies as the pandemic progresses and more individuals are expected to have lower IgM levels.

Serologic testing should not be used to determine immune status in individuals until the presence, durability, and duration of immunity are established.

Serologic testing can be offered as a method to support diagnosis of acute COVID-19 illness for persons who present late.* For persons who present 9–14 days after illness onset, serologic testing can be offered in addition to recommended viral direct detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction or antigen detection tests. During this time period, the sensitivity of nucleic acid detection is decreasing, and the sensitivity of serologic testing is increasing.

Serologic testing should be offered as a method to help support a diagnosis when patients present with late complications of COVID-19 illness, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.

Serologic testing by itself should not be used to establish the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or reinfection. Antibodies may not be present among those tested early in illness before antibodies develop or among those who never develop detectable antibodies following infection. In addition, the presence of antibodies may reflect previous infection and may be unrelated to the current illness.

Recommendations for persons who test positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicates a previous infection and possibly at least some degree of immunity or protection against future SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, until the durability and duration of immunity are established, it cannot be assumed that individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including total antibody, IgM, IgG, or IgA, are protected from future infection.

Asymptomatic persons who test positive by serologic testing without recent history of a COVID-19 confirmed or compatible illness have a low likelihood of active infection and should follow general recommendations to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2. They should continue with normal activities, including work.

Persons who have had a COVID-19 compatible or confirmed illness should follow previous guidance regarding when to resume normal activities, including work, regardless of the presence of antibodies.

There should be no change in clinical practice or use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by health care workers and first responders who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibody.

Additional considerations on the use of serologic tests

Serologic test results should not be used to make decisions about grouping persons residing in or being admitted to congregate settings, such as schools, dormitories, or correctional facilities.

Serologic test results should not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace.

Until more information is available about the dynamics of IgA detection in serum, testing for IgA antibodies is not recommended.

Serology Testing for COVID-19 at CDC,"CDC has developed a laboratory test to help estimate how many people in the United States have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Clinicians and researchers refer to this as a serology test, and many commercial laboratories call it an antibody test. CDC is using this serologic (antibody) test to evaluate the performance of commercial antibody tests. CDC will develop guidance for the use of antibody tests in clinical and public health settings.

An antibody test looks for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections. Antibodies are detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection; they show an immune response to the infection. Antibody test results are especially important for detecting previous infections in people who had few or no symptoms.

We do not know if the antibodies that result from SARS-CoV-2 infection will provide someone with protection (immunity) from getting infected again. If antibodies do provide immunity, we don’t know how much antibody is protective or how long protection might last. CDC scientists are currently conducting studies to answer these questions.

CDC’s serologic test has been designed and validated for surveillance and research purposes. It is designed to estimate the percentage of the U.S. population previously infected with the virus – information needed to guide the response to the pandemic and protect the public’s health.

The CDC test is not currently designed to test individuals who want to know if they have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Commercial tests are available to provide test results to individuals.

CDC is evaluating the performance of commercial antibody tests

Commercially manufactured antibody tests check for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in individuals and are available through healthcare providers and commercial laboratories. CDC is evaluating the performance of these tests in collaboration with the following federal organizations:

Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

National Institutes of Health

Department of Defense

White House Office of Science and Technology Policy

Results from the initial federal evaluation are included in FDA’s EUA Authorized Serology Test Performanceexternal icon and will be updated as more tests are evaluated.

Read CDC’s interim guidelines for using antibody tests in clinical and public health settings.

About CDC’s serologic test

CDC’s serologic test is an ELISA-based testexternal icon to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or plasma components of blood. It uses purified SARS-CoV-2 S protein (no live virus) as antigen (designed by the Vaccine Research Centerexternal icon at the National Institutes of Health).

CDC’s serologic test is designed to detect antibodies produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 and minimize cross-reactivity to antibodies generated to other common coronaviruses that cause less severe illnesses, such as colds. However, potential cross-reactivity cannot be completely ruled out.

CDC’s serologic test has a specificity of greater than 99% and a sensitivity of 96% based on initial performance evaluations. It can be used to identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection in people who were infected at least 1 to 3 weeks previously.

CDC serology surveillance strategy

CDC has a strategy for using antibody testing as part of surveillance efforts to better understand how much of the U.S. population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and how the virus is spreading through the population over time.

COVIDTracer 1.0,"COVIDTracer is a spreadsheet-based tool that allows state- and local-level public health officials and policy makers to compare three different contact tracing/monitoring strategies.

The tool allows you to vary estimates of the potential effectiveness of each strategy, the average number of contacts per case, and the time needed for case interviews and contact follow-up activities. Once you have entered such information, COVIDTracer provides you with estimates of the number of personnel needed to conduct case investigations, contact tracing, and case and contact monitoring. You can then compare the potential effectiveness of each of these three strategies to a baseline situation of continued social-distancing type interventions that have a user-defined level of effectiveness.

To use the COVIDTracer tool in your local jurisdiction, you first define the population, the number of cases to date, and the cases in the past 14 days. You also enter an estimated number of contacts per case and expected number of hours per day that contact tracers would work. You can assess up to three case identification and contact tracing and monitoring strategies simultaneously and compare the impacts on the total number of COVID-19 cases for each strategy over the course of the pandemic versus a “base case” social distancing scenario.

FAQ

Can COVIDTracer be used to accurately estimate the impact of COVID-19?

The numbers generated through COVIDTracer are NOT to be considered predictions of what will occur during a novel coronavirus pandemic. Rather, they are illustrations designed to aid public health officials in planning and preparing for contact tracing of COVID-19 cases.

"Recommendations for Disaster Sheltering of Household Pets, Service Animals, and Support Animals during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Acknowledgments This information is provided through the One Health Federal Interagency COVID-19 Coordination Group, Companion Animals1 subgroup, with contributions from federal partners. This document was reviewed by multiple stakeholders representing veterinary medicine, state partners,2 academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations.3

What You Need to Know Early planning and resource identification are critical to successful disaster animal sheltering.

Sheltering planning for people should include considerations for animals.

Veterinary support in shelter settings requires early discussions among emergency managers, response partners, veterinarians, public health officials, state animal health officials (SAHOs), veterinary medical associations, and veterinary medical colleges.

Social distancing and other precautionary practices among people, such as wearing masks and proper hand hygiene, have the largest impact on preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Almost all existing companion animal sheltering and veterinary medical response best practices will remain valid during this pandemic, and links to this information are provided in this document.

This document relies heavily on existing federal COVID-19 guidance. Please see References for more guidance.

Purpose

This information is provided to assist emergency planners who may need to consider local conditions, statutory authorities, resources, agreements, and other critical factors to form the final plan for disaster sheltering of household pets, service animals, and support animals during the pandemic.

Emergency managers will face many challenges pertaining to both the pandemic and a disaster that requires evacuation and sheltering. There are no perfect solutions, and all strategies could contain an element of risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in people.

Planning assumptions

Disaster animal sheltering is addressed first at the local level, with support from community non-governmental partners and other resource providers.

Animal diseases and zoonotic diseases 4 are significant concerns in animal disaster sheltering operations. Infection control in animal disaster sheltering operations is a frequent concern not exclusively related to SARS-CoV-2 virus.

are significant concerns in animal disaster sheltering operations. Infection control in animal disaster sheltering operations is a frequent concern not exclusively related to SARS-CoV-2 virus. The greatest risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (the disease), during the pandemic is person-to-person spread. Occasional transmission from people to animals has been documented. Transmission from animals to people has not been clearly demonstrated but may be possible. People and at least some companion animal species may be able to spread SARS-CoV-2 without showing symptoms of COVID-19, creating a baseline risk for all emergency response and support personnel as well as disaster/emergency survivors.

Pet owners should create or update their emergency plans, including for pets, to account for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Providing safe sheltering options for household pets, service animals, and support animals and their owners protects the safety of the public by encouraging individuals and families to evacuate in a timely manner.

CDC and other federal agencies will update guidance as new information becomes available. Emergency planners should monitor CDC’s COVID-19 website and seek additional guidance from local health departments and state animal health officials such as the state veterinarian.

General mass care considerations for local jurisdictions

Best practice documents for animal sheltering can be found on the FEMA/Red Cross National Mass Care Strategy websiteexternal icon. CDC guidance on human sheltering during the COVID-19 pandemic can be found on the on the National Mass Care Strategy website pdf icon[PDF – 9 Pages]external icon.

To reduce the potential for person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, communities and organizations should plan to use the minimal necessary staffing to support animal sheltering. Rotating teams or reserve staffing should be identified to provide relief or to step in if individuals or teams need to go into quarantine or self-isolation due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

How communities deliver human sheltering services will impact the methods of emergency sheltering for animals. Generally, animal sheltering formats include the following: Individual cohabitated housing: People are housed in hotel rooms or similar private accommodations pdf icon with their pets or service or support animals. Congregate cohabitated housing: People and pets or service or support animals are housed together within a larger shared space with other families. Co-located congregate sheltering: People are housed in a large shared space, and pets and other animals are housed nearby, allowing owners to provide almost all care for their animals. Animal-only emergency shelters: Pets and other animals are housed at a location that does not allow owners to provide routine care for their pets.



Assistance animals5 include service6 and support animals7: In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, service animals must be permitted to remain with their handlers. The Fair Housing Act also mandates that all assistance animals remain with their owners in housing, including emergency sheltering.

Pet shelter-in-place strategies may be used in some incidents according to local jurisdictional plans. In some cases, pets could remain sheltered in their homes with appropriate care visits at least once daily.

Considerations for animal intake and housing

General recommendations

Set up registration and triage for people and/or pets, service animals, and support animals in a location that allows people and their animals to stay at least six feet away from others and that protects them from the elements.

Instruct staff, volunteers, and survivors of the disaster on requirements for everyone 8 (i.e., staff, volunteers, and survivors) to wear masks, follow recommended hand hygiene practices, practice social distancing, and follow other jurisdictional guidelines while in any type of animal sheltering facility. Do not put masks on pets. Covering a pet’s face could harm them.

(i.e., staff, volunteers, and survivors) to wear masks, follow recommended hand hygiene practices, practice social distancing, and follow other jurisdictional guidelines while in any type of animal sheltering facility. Encourage staff, volunteers, and pet owners to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals. Follow CDC recommended precautions for people at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness and zoonotic diseases.

Jurisdictions may need a plan for managing people unwilling to comply with healthy practices. This might include assigning security personnel to sheltering sites.

Clearly communicate areas and procedures for walking/exercising dogs, collecting and disposing of animal waste, and other key owner/animal activities.

Advise owners to immediately report any signs of illness in their animals to shelter staff or volunteers.

Make hand hygiene stations readily available. Instruct owners to always wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or to use a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol before entering and after leaving an animal area. Hand hygiene stations should have adequate supplies of soap and water, or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, paper towels, tissues, and no-touch trash cans.

Owners should only handle their own animals. When possible, families in co-located shelters should designate one person to enter the animal area to care for the animal(s) or to check out/return the animal(s).

In some cases of animal-only sheltering, owners might not be allowed to visit pets, and jurisdictions should consider the use of telecommunications to allow virtual audiovisual visits.

Every congregate cohabitated companion animal shelter should have veterinary medical support to provide examinations and address animal health issues at the shelter.

Staff should use handouts, signs, and verbal encouragement to help communicate the need for healthy behaviors around animals and social distancing of at least 6 feet between people, between people and pets, and between pets from other households.

Discourage owners, staff, and volunteers from eating and drinking in animal housing areas.

Discourage owners from letting other people handle items that go into their animal’s mouth, such as toys and treats.

Discourage sharing of items between animals from different households (for example, leashes, toys, or blankets). If items like leashes must be shared, they should be cleaned and disinfected after each use or between each animal.

Animal intake triage and housing

The following applies to all congregate cohabitated companion animal emergency shelters. Owned animals entering private sheltering (such as hotel rooms) may not need a veterinary examination.

The flow chart below illustrates the initial intake and levels of precautions needed for housing animals with various combinations of history and clinical signs.

*If an animal has an examination that is suggestive of a contagious disease, including SARS-CoV-2, that animal should be examined by a veterinarian.

An epidemiologic link to a human COVID-19 case or a SARS-CoV-2 animal case is defined as: Being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of either a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 or another animal infected with SARS-CoV-2 Having direct contact with secretions from a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (e.g., saliva, respiratory droplets) or an animal with SARS-CoV-2 infection

All animals should receive a screening examination from a veterinarian, veterinary technician, or experienced animal care and handling specialist external icon . If the screening examination finds signs that could be consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection or another infectious disease or significant health problem, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian if a veterinarian did not perform the initial screening examination.

. If the screening examination finds signs that could be consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection or another infectious disease or significant health problem, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian if a veterinarian did not perform the initial screening examination. The following signs are potentially consistent with, but not specific to, SARS-CoV-2 infection in any companion animals and could represent a wide array of infectious and non-infectious diseases: Fever, lethargy Coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Sneezing, nasal or ocular discharge Vomiting, diarrhea

Animal intake staff should ask the following: Has the animal been exposed to a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19? Exposure includes close contact with a known or possibly infected family member or other person (being within 6 feet of the person, direct contact, sleeping in the same bed, sharing food, kissing, snuggling, or being exposed to sneezes or saliva). Has the owner noticed any signs of illness in their pet, particularly coughing, breathing difficulty, sneezing, runny eyes or nose, fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, vomiting or diarrhea?

Animals should be assigned to one of the following housing areas: 9 General housing : Area for animals that do not appear sick and do not have a known history of exposure to people with COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected). General precautions are appropriate for this area. Separated housing : Area for animals with a known history of exposure to people with COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected) but that are showing no signs of illness. Intermediate precautions (defined in the graphic above) are appropriate in this zone. Animals in separated housing should not be allowed in or around animals in the general housing area. Owners with exposure history should be managed according to local public health policy, the National Mass Care Strategy external icon , and CDC Interim Guidance for General Population Disaster Shelters During the COVID-19 Pandemic pdf icon . In private accommodations, animals can remain with their owners with appropriate precautions. Isolation: Area(s) for animals that may have a disease potentially transmittable to people or other animals.

House animals from different households with increased space (6 feet or greater) between cages, crates, or kennels when possible. When out of the enclosure, keep dogs on a leash and maintain 6 feet in distance from other animals and people other than the owner/family members.

House cats in the largest cages available. Increased cage size has been shown to help reduce the incidence of respiratory virus outbreaks. 10

Co-located and animal-only companion animal shelters may have five or more areas for animal housing: General population area for dogs General population area for cats and other small pets 11 Separation area for dogs (if needed) Separation area for cats and other small pets (if needed) Isolation area(s) as necessary



Veterinary medical care

Information on general best practices for veterinary medical care, precautions, personal protective equipment (PPE), and disinfection can be found in the best practice document on the National Mass Care Strategy Site. external icon

Veterinary professionals provide a critical role in emergency companion animal sheltering in providing care for animals, as well as the crucial task of supporting infection control, biosafety measures, and zoonotic disease prevention at the facility. Veterinarians should work closely with state animal health and local/state public health officials in planning operational practices of infection control and biosecurity. Community veterinary professionals should be integrated into the planning process for emergency animal sheltering as soon as possible.

National personal protective equipment (PPE) prioritization may impact the choice of PPE used by veterinary personnel. Veterinary professionals supporting emergency animal sheltering should discuss protective measures recommended in this document with local public health officials and determine specific jurisdictional policies on PPE, PPE availability, and infection mitigating practices.

During all disasters and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to maintain continuity of veterinary care through effective records and communication among veterinary staff supporting the emergency animal shelter(s).

Use telemedicine, or virtual veterinary visits, as an adjunct to direct examination. While veterinarians may not be able to be at the shelter continuously, having access for video calls through which information and visuals can be shared could effectively expand veterinary support. Telemedicine can also reduce the need for additional people to be onsite, potentially reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the location. Local planners should request input from their state veterinary medical association on the use of telemedicine in supporting disaster animal sheltering.

Follow best practice documents including CDC guidance on zoonoses prevention in emergency animal sheltering. No specific changes in preventive care should be made for the COVID-19 pandemic.

The following are suggested standards for daily observation and examination: Ensure that there is a system for staff and volunteers to record abnormalities in all animals related to eating, drinking, urination, defecation, alertness, or other observations they make while caring for the animals each day. A veterinary technician/assistant or experienced animal care and handling specialist should observe every animal every day and report any abnormalities to the attending veterinarian(s). Abnormal findings should result in a veterinary examination or telemedicine consultation.

Veterinarians may also be able to provide examinations, treatments, and isolation areas at offsite animal hospitals, reducing the number of people coming into shelters. Animal shelters may have isolation facilities[1] and may be able to provide veterinary support as well.

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in animals

CDC provides guidance on testing animals for SARS-CoV-2 and a USDA provides a U.S. case definition. pdf icon external icon

Animals that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be reported to state public health (e.g., the state public health veterinarian) and state animal health officials (e.g., the state veterinarian).

Animals that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be managed according to local and state, tribal or territorial guidance in conjunction with CDC’s Toolkit: One Health Approach to Address Companion Animals with SARS-CoV-2.

Personal protective equipment and safe behaviors

Cleaning and disinfection of premises

For animals with no signs of contagious illness, use cleaning and disinfection practices as described in CDC guidance for pet stores. Cleaners and disinfectants should be stored out of reach of pets and children.

For animals with signs of contagious illness, follow CDC guidance for veterinary clinics: Use gloves when handling the pet’s dishes, toys, or bedding and when cleaning up urine, feces, or vomit. Throw out gloves and place waste material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before throwing it away in a trashcan lined with a trash bag. Always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds immediately after cleaning up after pets. For cleaning up body fluids (e.g., urine, feces, blood, saliva, vomit) from high-risk animals (defined in the flow chart above): Wear appropriate PPE. Contain the urine, feces, blood, saliva, or vomit with absorbent material (e.g., paper towels, sawdust, or cat litter) and pick up the absorbent material and bodily fluids and seal in a leak-proof plastic bag. Clean and disinfect the area with an EPA-registered disinfectant external icon according to the disinfectant label instructions. Visibly soiled surfaces should be cleaned before disinfecting. After disinfection, safely remove and dispose of PPE according to locally accepted procedures and wash hands. Keep other people and animals away from the area until disinfection is completed.

If a high-risk animal becomes sick or dies while in the shelter, seek additional guidance (with consultation from the owner) from supporting veterinary personnel, local health departments and state animal health officials to determine cause of death and manage the remains.

Shelter staff responder and volunteer monitoring

For sick animals, including those that test positive for SARS-CoV-2, limit the number of people who have contact with the animal and maintain a log of all personnel who have had contact with the animal for occupational health monitoring.

For staff/responders who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, consider maintaining a log of the animals that the staff/responder worked with and monitor these animals for clinical signs of illness. Inform the owner if someone who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was in contact with their animal.

For monitoring of responders and volunteers, follow current CDC guidance for businesses and employers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Animal sheltering team or veterinary healthcare team members, staff, or volunteers who have symptoms of fever or acute respiratory illness should stay at home and consult with their healthcare provider. Communicate expectations and procedures developed from the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

CDC’s Interim Guidance for General Population Disaster Shelters During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This interim guidance is based on current information about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the CDC COVID-19 website periodically for updated guidance. Because conditions vary from community to community, disaster shelter managers should look to their state and local health officials for information specific to their location.

Key points Alternatives to opening disaster shelters, such as sheltering in place, should be considered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hotels/dormitories and small shelters (fewer than 50 residents) should be prioritized over larger shelters. Large congregate shelters should be a last resort.

Officials should demobilize large congregate shelters as soon as possible after the emergency phase and relocate residents to hotels/dormitories or small shelters for better social distancing.

Shelter managers should maintain contact with state and local public health agencies and emergency management for updates on local COVID-19 information.

Shelter health staff should monitor residents daily for symptoms of COVID-19 and other illness, including mental health concerns, and provide a daily status update to the local health department and other relevant agencies. View resources on daily life and coping .

Body temperature monitoring should be conducted for all persons entering the shelter and in food distribution areas.

Shelters should provide separate areas, including restrooms, to isolate residents with symptoms of COVID-19.

Shelter staff and residents should wear a mask at all times except when not practical, such as when eating or showering. NOTE: Masks should not be placed on babies or children younger than 2 years of age or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance.

All shelter residents, even those without symptoms, may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should self- quarantine after leaving the shelter in accordance with state and local recommendations.

If testing for COVID-19 is available, shelter staff, volunteers, and residents should be tested in accordance with state and local health department guidelines. During disasters, resource availability may limit the ability to apply this guidance. Best efforts should be made to implement this guidance to the extent possible.

Target audience

This document is intended for use by federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions in the United States. It should be used in conjunction with existing shelter operation and management plans, procedures, guidance, resources, and systems, and is not a substitute for shelter planning and preparedness activities.

Purpose

This document provides interim guidance to reduce the risk of introducing and transmitting COVID-19 in general population disaster shelters before, during, or after a disaster.

This document should not be applied to medical support shelters or functional needs shelters.

Medical support shelters and functional needs shelters should follow the Interim Guidance for Healthcare Facilities: Preparing for Community Transmission.

For the purposes of this document, “shelters” include small-, medium- and large-scale, organized, and temporary accommodations for persons displaced by disasters. Facilities may be residential (e.g., dormitories, campsites) or non-residential (e.g., sports stadiums, schools, churches), with varying degrees of sanitary infrastructure.

General population emergency shelters

Individuals housed in shelters share living spaces and sanitary facilities and may be exposed to crowded conditions. Emergency managers, shelter coordinators/managers, and public health professionals should understand the risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in these settings. These recommendations were developed to assist shelter staff in taking appropriate actions for reducing the possibility of transmission among shelter staff, volunteers, residents, and visitors.

People who need to take extra precautions

View additional information for groups who need to take extra precautions.

People at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 may include:

People 65 years or older

Persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions including chronic lung disease, serious heart conditions, and diabetes. See CDC’s website for a complete list of people at higher risk, and check regularly for updates as more data become available.

Higher risk shelter residents should be prioritized for COVID-19 testing and personal protective equipment if resources are available but limited.

Some staff and volunteers may be at higher risk for severe illness. Plan for alternative staffing resources to replace high risk staff and volunteers during the COVID-19 Consider pre-deployment of additional healthcare workers and mental health personnel to shelters.

Other people who may need to take extra precautions include:

People with disabilities

Pregnant or breastfeeding mothers

People experiencing homelessness

Racial and ethnic minority groups

Screening, monitoring, and isolation

Shelters should monitor and record possible COVID-19 cases and perform periodic assessments of all shelter policies and procedures related to lowering transmission on COVID-19 (e.g. isolation area, social distancing, meal service, cleaning, disinfection). Case numbers should be shared with local public health officials daily to alert them to increasing numbers.

Access to safe shelter from disasters is critical even during community spread of COVID-19. Disaster shelters should not exclude as residents people who are having symptoms or test positive for COVID-19.

Screen all people entering the shelter (residents, staff, volunteers, and visitors) for signs of COVID-19 using the CDC recommended tool for screening for symptoms at entry to homeless shelters.

Staff, volunteers, and visitors who screen positive for COVID-19 symptoms should be sent home immediately, if feasible, and advised to follow CDC recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID- 19 symptoms. If staff or volunteers are also residents of the shelter, they should be directed to an isolation area.

Following medical screening, residents should be grouped as “not sick,” “sick,” and “requires immediate medical attention.”

If a resident is classified as “sick” Provide a mask if available, and if the person can tolerate it. NOTE: Masks should not be placed on babies or children younger than 2 years of age or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance. Advise the resident on cough etiquette and provide tissues if a mask is not tolerated. Direct the resident to an isolation area in the shelter or at another location, according to a predesignated plan.

If a person “requires immediate medical attention” Call emergency services for transport and tell the operator this is a probable case of COVID-19.



Intake area and waiting room

Provide handwashing stations or alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, tissues, and wastebaskets. See additional information on CDC’s handwashing recommendations.

Utilize trained medical or healthcare staff to conduct medical screening.

Provide additional personnel for medical screening to decrease intake time.

Staff who are checking client temperatures should use a system that creates a physical barrier between the client and the screener. Screeners should stand behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition that can protect the staff member’s face from respiratory droplets that may be produced if the client sneezes, coughs, or talks. If social distancing or barrier/partition controls cannot be put in place during screening, screeners should use PPE (i.e., facemask, eye protection [goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face], a single pair of disposable gloves) when within 6 feet of a client. However, given PPE shortages, training requirements, and because PPE alone is less effective than a barrier, staff should try to use a barrier whenever possible.

Conduct thorough cleaning and disinfection of the area every 4-6 hours. See additional information on CDC’s entry screening

See additional information on CDC’s entry screening recommendations.

Isolation area

When possible, place sick residents in individual rooms for isolation.

If individual rooms are not possible, designate a separate isolation area for sick residents.

Let the resident know: They should notify shelter staff immediately if their symptoms worsen. They should not leave their room/isolation area except to use the restroom. They should keep a distance of at least 6 feet away from other residents in the isolation area. They must wear a mask at all times, except when eating or showering, unless they have trouble breathing.

Isolation areas or buildings should be separate from the rest of the shelter.

Isolation areas should be well-ventilated.

At least 6 feet of distance should be maintained between residents in isolation areas.

Cots should be placed at least 6 feet apart with temporary barriers between them.

Bathroom facilities should be near the isolation area and separate from bathrooms used by well residents.

Shelter staff providing medical care to clients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 where close contact (within 6 feet) cannot be avoided, should at a minimum, wear eye protection (goggles or face shield), an N95 or higher-level respirator (or a facemask if respirators are not available or staff are not fit tested), disposable gown, and disposable gloves. Masks are not PPE and should not be used when a respirator or facemask is indicated. View infection control guidelines for healthcare providers.

View infection control guidelines for healthcare providers. Shelter staff who enter the isolation area for reasons other than providing medical care (e.g. delivering meals or other items) should wear N95 masks (or a facemask if respirators are not available or staff are not fit tested).

Additional comfort items, like tissues and blankets, should be provided for sick residents.

Discontinuation of isolation

The decision to discontinue isolation should be made in the context of local circumstances. Options include:

A symptom-based strategy (i.e., time since illness onset and time since recovery)

A test-based strategy

Time-based and test-based strategies for people who tested positive for COVID-19 but did not experience symptoms.

For additional information please refer to the CDC interim guidance Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings, which includes, but is not limited to, at home, in a hotel or dormitory room, or in group isolation facility.

Information in all common areas of the shelter

Post signage throughout the facility on: Common symptoms of COVID-19 Importance of wearing a mask The need to follow frequent handwashing and proper respiratory etiquette Reporting symptoms to shelter staff if they feel ill Reminding staff to wash their hands with soap and water after touching someone who is sick or handling a sick person’s personal effects, used tissues, or laundry Coping with stress



Ensure signage is understandable for non-English speaking persons and those with low literacy. Make necessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or with low vision.

CDC print materials developed to support COVID-19 recommendations are available and free for download.

Social distancing

When possible, place groups or families in individual rooms or in separate areas of the facility.

Shelter facility should be large enough to provide space for distancing among residents.

Provide a distance of at least 6 feet between cots of people from different households and have residents sleep head-to-toe.

Food service

Serve pre-packaged meals or individual meals dispensed by food service workers when possible.

Food service workers should wear gloves and masks during meal preparation and service.

Cafeteria-style service is preferred over self-service, buffet, or family-style while maintaining a minimum of 6 foot spacing between individuals.

Maintain a minimum of 6 feet of distance between people of different households at mealtimes using increased table spacing and staggered mealtimes. Clean and disinfect the area between meal service times.

Encourage staff and shelter residents to not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people.

Serve using disposable silverware, cups, and plates, if available. If these items are not disposable, the food contact surface should be protected from contamination and cleaned and disinfected after each use.

Provide handwashing stations and soap with disposable towels or alcohol-based hand sanitizer (minimum 60% alcohol) for use prior to entering food lines.

Residents should wear masks while in the food line.

Position shelter staff at handwashing stations to promote proper handwashing and to monitor for signs of illness. Staff should wear masks.

Implement illness screening, including fever monitoring, of residents entering the food distribution Any temperature of 100.4 F or greater is considered a fever. Staff and volunteers who are symptomatic should leave the facility as soon as possible. Residents who are symptomatic should be directed to the isolation area. Increase monitoring for symptoms among close contacts of people who become symptomatic.



Increased use of supplies

Plan for a significant increase in use of supplies including:

Masks, gowns, and gloves

Masks

Water and other fluids for hydration

Ice

Cups and other utensils

Facial tissues

Soap

Handwashing stations

Hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol

Paper towels

Disinfection and cleaning agents and supplies

Bed linens/blankets

Materials to be used for barriers between cots in separation area(s)

Over-the-counter medications Consult a healthcare provider when considering giving over-the-counter medications to children. Children younger than 4 years of age should NOT be given over-the-counter cold medications without first speaking with a healthcare provider. Do NOT give aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) to children who appear sick; this can cause a rare but serious illness called Reye’s syndrome.



Cleaning and disinfection

The risk of exposure to cleaning staff is inherently low. Train staff members who perform cleaning functions using CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection. These recommendations will be updated as additional information becomes available. Instructional materials for custodial and other staff should be provided in languages other than English as locally appropriate.

Disinfection should be done using an EPA-registered disinfectant external icon .

. Cleaning staff should wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash.

Solid waste (trash) such as tissues, food items, and drink containers should be considered as potentially “infectious waste.”

Waste receptacles with non-removable, no-touch lids, should be placed a reasonable distance away from any populated areas.

Place a handwashing station or hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol next to any waste receptables. Disinfect the lids and handles of receptacles on a regular basis.

Outdoor waste receptacles should be covered with lids.

Areas and items that are visibly soiled should be cleaned immediately.

All common areas should be cleaned and disinfected every 4 hours with a focus on frequently touched surfaces like tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, and sinks.

Linens (such as bed sheets and towels), eating utensils, and dishes belonging to those who are sick do not need to be cleaned separately, but they should not be shared without having been thoroughly washed. Wash linens using laundry soap and tumble dry on the warmest setting possible.

Staff should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol immediately after handling dirty laundry or used eating utensils and dishes.

Air Filtration

If possible:

Locate disaster shelters in buildings with high ventilation capacity similar to healthcare facilities.

Shelters should be equipped with air exchange systems.

Shelters should be located in buildings with tall ceilings.

Utilize the highest efficiency filters that are compatible with the shelter’s existing HVAC system.

Adopt “clean-to-dirty” directional airflows.

Select upward airflow rotation if using ceiling fans.

Special considerations for children

Educate parents and caregivers about how to reduce the spread of illness.

Help parents understand that children may feel stress and fear while in the shelter. Information on coping with stress can help parents manage their own stress and that of their children.

Encourage parents and caregivers to monitor children for symptoms of illness and to report any suspected illness immediately to shelter staff. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.

Instruct parents/guardians to assist children to stay at least 6 feet away from other residents.

If possible, at nap time, ensure that children’s naptime mats (or cribs) are spaced out as much as possible, ideally 6 feet apart. Consider placing children head to toe in order to further reduce the potential for disease spread.

Assign the same mat/crib to one child or disinfect mat/crib between use by different children.

Thoroughly clean common play areas or temporary respite care areas every 4-6 hours with a focus on items that are more likely to have frequent contact with the hands, mouths, or bodily fluids of children (e.g., toys).

Clean and disinfect toys Toys that cannot be cleaned and disinfected should not be used. Toys that children have placed in their mouths or that are otherwise contaminated by body secretions or excretions should be set aside until they are cleaned by hand by a person wearing gloves. Clean with water and detergent, rinse, disinfect with an EPA-registered disinfectant, rinse again, and air-dry. You may also clean in a mechanical dishwasher. Be mindful of items more likely to be placed in a child’s mouth, like play food, dishes, and utensils. Machine washable cloth toys should be used by one individual at a time or should not be used at all. These toys should be laundered before being used by another child. Do not share toys with other groups of infants or toddlers, unless they are washed and disinfected before being moved from one group to the other. Set aside toys that need to be cleaned. Place in a dish pan with soapy water or put in a separate container marked for “soiled toys.” Keep dish pans and water out of reach of children to prevent risk of drowning. Washing with soapy water is the ideal method for cleaning. Try to have enough toys so that the toys can be rotated through cleanings. Children’s books, like other paper-based materials such as mail or envelopes, are not considered a high risk for transmission and do not need additional cleaning or disinfection procedures.

Require hand hygiene for children, parents, and staff before entering and leaving the children’s temporary respite care area.

Hand sanitizer should be kept out of reach of children.

Animals in emergency shelters

These recommendations outline special considerations for lowering COVID-19 transmission risk in human shelters that also house animals. While the risk of transmission from animals to humans is believed to be low, precautions should be taken to prevent possible transmission. For more information, review CDC’s Recommendations for Disaster Sheltering of Household Pets, Service Animals, and Support Animals during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

NOTE: Do not put masks or other face coverings on animals, even if they appear sick.

Companion animals (pets)

The scope of these recommendations is limited to special considerations for pet-friendly disaster shelters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on general shelter operations can be found in the FEMA Best Practice “Shelter Operations: Pet-Friendly Shelterspdf iconexternal icon” document. Detailed recommendations on handling exposed animals is available in the “Interim recommendations for intake of companion animals from households where humansexternal icon with COVID-19 are presentexternal icon” developed by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), with support from CDC One Health.

Animal areas

Note: Recommendations for operating the human shelter should be applied by any person in the animal areas. Use of masks, frequent handwashing, social distancing, and frequent cleaning and disinfection should be maintained in the animal areas. Do not put any type of face covering on animals.

Identify an area to shelter companion animals away from the human living space.

Provide a separate area of the shelter for companion animals that had contact with a person with known or suspected COVID-19 and companion animals who show signs of illness.

Upon registration, ask if the animal may have been exposed to a person with known or suspected COVID-19 within the previous 14 days. Contact can result from: Being within approximately 6 feet of the person. Giving kisses or licks, and/or sharing food or bedding with the person. Being snuggled, pet, coughed, sneezed, or spit on by the person.



If yes, the animal should be sheltered in the animal isolation area.

Collect information about COVID-19 exposure status of pets at entry, as well as any clinical signs in pets consistent with COVID-19, to aid in triaging and proper isolation.

Separate animals by a distance of at least 6 feet at all times, including during pet registration and exercise.

Limit access to animals to one healthy family member for the duration of the stay.

Provide handwashing stations at entry and exit to the animal areas.

All people should wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds upon entry and exit to the area.

Anyone handling animals who may have been exposed or show signs of illness should wear gloves and a mask. Gloves should be disposed of after each use.

If an animal gets sick while in the shelter: Call a veterinarian and let them know the animal may have been exposed to a person with COVID- 19. Contact local animal health and public health authorities to determine if the animal should be tested and if other precautions should be taken.



Service animals

In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), service animals must be allowed to stay with their handlers.

It is important to keep in mind that:

Service animals are approved under the ADA regardless of whether they are licensed or certified.

Persons with service animals cannot be isolated from other people or treated less favorably.

Persons with service animals cannot be asked to remove their service animal from the shelter unless: Animal is out of control Animal poses a direct threat



If the handler shows signs of illness:

If available, provide a separate room where the handler and service animal can isolate together. If a separate room is not available, the handler and service animal should move to the group isolation area.

Service animal should remain at least 6 feet apart from other people in the isolation area.

To the extent possible, the handler should limit contact between themselves and their service animal (e.g., avoiding petting, snuggling, or other contact not related to the service animal’s work or task).

Handler should wash hands frequently and before and after touching the service animal.

If possible, have someone who is not symptomatic walk, exercise, and feed the service animal.

If the service animal shows signs of illness:

Follow the recommendations in the bullets above, except if a separate room is not available the handler and service animal should remain in the general population area.

Do not put any type of face covering on the service animal.

The handler or other caretaker should wear gloves and a mask when walking, exercising, or feeding the animals. Gloves should be disposed of after each use.

Call a veterinarian and let them know the animal may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19.

Contact local animal health and public health to determine if the animal should be tested and if other precautions should be taken.

Air pollution & COVID-19,"Transcript

Vismita Gupta-Smith:

Many countries around the world are experiencing high levels of air pollution. How does that impact our body in times of COVID-19? Talking to us in Science in 5 today is WHO’s Dr Maria Neira. Welcome, Maria. My first question to you: How concerned should we be about air pollution and COVID-19?

Dr Maria Neira:

Certainly, Vismita, we are very concerned, because air pollution – as probably many people know by now – represents 7 million premature deaths caused every year due to the exposure of air pollution. If you realise that exposure to air pollution will increase the risk of diseases of the respiratory system – and the COVID-19 is mainly a disease of the respiratory system – you will realise that we are increasing the susceptibility, the vulnerability of people who are exposed to air pollution. Therefore, we need to make sure that this double burden is tackled in a very important way, addressing as well the causes of air pollution.

Vismita Gupta-Smith:

Maria, explain to us exactly how air pollution impacts our body.

Dr Maria Neira:

Well, air pollution is the bad quality of the air we breathe and that bad quality of the air we breathe, it goes to our lungs. Through our lungs, it will cause already major damage, increasing the risk of chronic respiratory diseases: lung cancer, obstructive chronic pulmonary diseases, asthma, pneumonia, and others. And from there, the very small particles can reach as well the bloodstream, affecting as well our cardiovascular system and other organs, of course. But then we know that, in the case of the patients with COVID-19, those who will be more at severe risk of developing illness are those with underlying conditions like high blood pressure or heart diseases or respiratory diseases. We see where air pollution might exacerbate those diseases and make the patients, the population, more vulnerable to the disease, plus to the severity of developing a more serious illness.

Vismita Gupta-Smith:

So Maria, people are experiencing a lot of fatigue due to the pandemic. It is also very scary to hear about the impacts of air pollution at the same time. What can we do to protect ourselves from air pollution, as well as COVID-19?

Dr Maria Neira:

Well, I think for COVID-19, WHO has repeated many times what are the measures we need to take: from washing your hands, maintaining good hygiene, ensuring that you respect the physical distance that it is recommending, avoiding the very crowded places where you have very close contact with other people, ensuring natural ventilation, and the use of masks whenever they are recommended. But in the case of air pollution, the most important recommendation we can say is, that in those countries where the levels of air pollution are very high, we need to enforce legislation to reduce those levels of air pollution. We need to make sure that as citizens, we are aware of the fact that the air pollution is affecting our health, and by doing so, requesting our authorities, at the city or the country level, to tackle the causes of air pollution, reducing the emissions. And particularly one important one will be stopping burning fossil fuels, which are contributing enormously to this air pollution and, therefore, the illnesses that exposure to air pollution is causing.

Vismita Gupta-Smith:

Thank you, Maria. There you have it, WHO’s Dr Maria Neira explaining the impact of air pollution and COVID-19 on our bodies. If you found this content useful, please share it with your friends and help us get WHO’s life-saving content and information out to the public. Until next time then.

Unity Studies: Early Investigation Protocols,"The Unity Studies: WHO Early Investigations Protocols

The emergence of a new virus means that understanding transmission patterns, immunity, severity, clinical features, and risk factors for infection are still limited. To address these unknowns, WHO has launched a global initiative which aims to enable any countries, in any resource setting, to gather rapidly robust data on key epidemiological parameters to understand, respond and control the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO, in collaboration with

technical partners, has developed several generic investigation protocols, branded the WHO Unity Studies. These protocols use a combination of molecular and serologic testing.

These protocols are designed to rapidly and systematically collect and share data in a format that facilitates aggregation, tabulation and analysis across different settings globally.

The widespread adoption of the Unity protocols in more than 90 countries, underlines their usefulness to support countries’ decision-making to implement or lift appropriate public health and social measures to prevent and control the COVID-19 infection.",,
Naming the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus that causes it,"Official names have been announced for the virus responsible for COVID-19 (previously known as “2019 novel coronavirus”) and the disease it causes. The official names are:

Disease



coronavirus disease



(COVID-19)



Virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

(SARS-CoV-2)

Why do the virus and the disease have different names?



Viruses, and the diseases they cause, often have different names. For example, HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. People often know the name of a disease, but not the name of the virus that causes it.



There are different processes, and purposes, for naming viruses and diseases.



Viruses are named based on their genetic structure to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. Virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses are named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).

Diseases are named to enable discussion on disease prevention, spread, transmissibility, severity and treatment. Human disease preparedness and response is WHO’s role, so diseases are officially named by WHO in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).



ICTV announced “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” as the name of the new virus on 11 February 2020. This name was chosen because the virus is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. While related, the two viruses are different.



WHO announced “COVID-19” as the name of this new disease on 11 February 2020, following guidelines previously developed with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).



WHO and ICTV were in communication about the naming of both the virus and the disease.

What name does WHO use for the virus?

From a risk communications perspective, using the name SARS can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003.

For that reason and others, WHO has begun referring to the virus as “the virus responsible for COVID-19” or “the COVID-19 virus” when communicating with the public. Neither of these designations are intended as replacements for the official name of the virus as agreed by the ICTV.

Material published before the virus was officially named will not be updated unless necessary in order to avoid confusion.

Maintaining Essential Health Services and Systems,"Harmonized health service capacity assessments in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic

Countries are facing a multitude of questions that must be addressed to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 while maintaining other essential health services across the life course. Key decisions and actions must be informed by accurate and timely data on health service delivery and utilization throughout all phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Harmonized health service capacity assessments in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is a suite of health facility assessment tools to support rapid and accurate assessments of the current, surge and future capacities of health facilities throughout the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Essential resource planning,"WHO surge calculators

To gauge the need for supplies/equipment and health work force requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO has developed a suite of complimentary surge calculators -- one for supplies and two for health workforce. All tools use the same base epidemiologic assumptions and classify health workforce using standardized International Labor Organization International Standard Classification of Occupations codes, but their outputs are intentionally different due to their primary focus.

Forecasting supplies, diagnostics and equipment requirements

The WHO COVID-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool (ESFT) is designed to help governments, partners, and other stakeholders to estimate potential requirements for essential supplies to respond to the current pandemic of COVID-19. Although it provides an estimation of the number of cases, this calculator is not an epidemiological calculator. The focus of this tool is to forecast essential supplies: it includes estimation of personal protective equipment, diagnostic equipment, biomedical equipment for case management, essential drugs for supportive care, and consumable medical supplies.

Forecasting health workforce requirements

Adaptt Surge Planning Support Tool is an Excel-based graphical tool intended for policy-makers and senior planners. It allows Member States to focus on surge planning information, such as: the number of beds required, the dates of predicted bed shortages; and the detailed human resources needed. The tool is flexible, enabling users within Member States to input epidemiological data, vary mitigation scenarios (when using the embedded standardized infection ratio V3 data) and tailor the tool to account for attack rates. The tool supports the input of hospital activities and practices, hospital capacity, and human resources for health capacity.

Maintaining essential health services,"Coming soon

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have requested urgent support from WHO to maintain their health services whilst mounting their pandemic response.

To that end, WHO is developing the COVID19: Health Services Learning Hub (HLH), a web-based platform that will allow the critical sharing of experiences and learning from innovative country practices that can inform the collective global response.

The learning hub will be based on WHO’s Operational guidance for maintaining essential health services during an outbreak, which provides a set of targeted actions countries should take at national, regional, and local levels to reorganize and maintain access to essential quality health services for all. It will use key areas of the guidance as an entry point for learning.

Vaccines work by training and preparing the body’s natural defences --- the immune system--- to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. If the body is exposed to those disease-causing germs later, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing illness.

Immunization currently prevents 2-3 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles. There are now vaccines to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, and work is ongoing at unprecedented speed to also make COVID-19 a vaccine-preventable disease.



There are currently more than 100 COVID-19 vaccine candidates under development, with a number of these in the human trial phase. WHO is working in collaboration with scientists, business, and global health organizations through the ACT Accelerator to speed up the pandemic response. When a safe and effective vaccine is found, COVAX (led by WHO, GAVI and CEPI) will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of these vaccines to protect people in all countries. People most at risk will be prioritized.",,
"""Solidarity 2"" global serologic study for COVID-19","A complete understanding of the epidemiology and global risk posed by SARS-CoV-2 requires systematic serologic testing. Serologic testing detects antibodies in the blood that indicate if a person has already been infected. By conducting surveys among different populations around the world, we can together understand the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn will allow local, national, and international decision-makers to respond collectively to the pandemic.



Unique features of Solidarity II are that it provides a global platform for government and academic collaborators to share cutting-edge scientific advances in the area of serologic surveys; accelerates progress globally towards understanding the COVID-19 pandemic; provides every country access to the tools and procedures needed to conduct their own serologic surveys; and promotes access to scientific discovery for all populations globally.",,
Accelerating a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine,"The availability of a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 is well-recognized as an additional tool to contribute to the control of the pandemic. At the same time, the challenges and efforts needed to rapidly develop, evaluate and produce this at scale are enormous. It is vital that we evaluate as many vaccines as possible as we cannot predict how many will turn out to be viable.

To increase the chances of success (given the high level of attrition during vaccine development), we must test all candidate vaccines until they fail. WHO is working to ensure that all of them have the chance of being tested at the initial stage of development.

This is a major and extraordinary global research undertaking: WHO is facilitating collaboration and accelerated efforts on a scale not seen before; it is convening vital communications across the research community and beyond.",,

How to vote if you've been exposed to COVID: CDC,"How to vote if you've been exposed to COVID: CDC Voters who are sick must take steps to protect poll workers and others.

Tens of thousands of Americans with newly diagnosed cases of coronavirus face a dilemma if they haven't already voted in the presidential election: Are they allowed to vote in person on Tuesday?

Yes, but they need to take precautions to protect poll workers and other voters, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Having COVID-19 or being exposed to the virus ""would not preclude them from exercising their right to vote,"" Jasmine Reed, a CDC spokesperson, told ABC News in a statement.

While voting in person can be accomplished safely, according to the CDC, the agency recommends that whenever possible ""alternative voting options should be made available for those with COVID-19, those who have symptoms of COVID-19 and those who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19.""

The CDC recommends that alternative voting options minimize contact between poll workers and voters and that polling places provide workers with masks, face shields, gloves and gowns, and train workers on how to use that personal protective equipment correctly, before they interact with symptomatic voters.

It's also imperative that voters who are sick take steps to protect poll workers and other voters.

""This includes wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet away from others, and washing their hands or using hand sanitizer before and after voting,"" Reed said. ""These voters also should let poll workers know about their condition when arriving at the polling location.""",,
Midwestern states with few virus rules have low unemployment,"Midwestern states with few virus rules have low unemployment Five of the six states with the nation’s lowest unemployment rates are in the Midwest, have Republican governors and have almost no restrictions intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus

OMAHA, Neb. -- Five of the six states with the nation’s lowest unemployment rates are in the Midwest, have Republican governors and have almost no restrictions intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

The governors say their decisions not to impose harsher restrictions are paying off with fewer business closures and more hiring reflected in the strong jobless numbers. But economists say it’s not so simple. Although businesses that are struggling during the pandemic can benefit when governors opt not to require masks or limit in-door gatherings, other factors may play an even bigger role in producing such low unemployment rates.

And those same rules that could initially help the states’ economies also are blamed for their leading the nation in coronavirus infection rates, raising questions about whether their hands-off approach is sustainable. North Dakota and South Dakota have the most cases per capita in the U.S., and Nebraska and Iowa aren’t far behind.

“If hospitalization and death rates increase, then you have a motivation by politicians to close the economy down. That would be very deadly and push unemployment rates back up,” said Ernie Goss, an economist at Creighton University in Omaha.

For now, though, those Midwestern states have a lock atop the unemployment rankings, far below the national average rate for September of 7.9%. Nebraska leads the nation with a 3.5% unemployment rate, followed by South Dakota, Vermont, North Dakota, Iowa and Missouri.

Most of the Midwestern governors imposed some restrictions last spring, but they were among the first to ease them, arguing that they needed to balance efforts to slow the virus’ spread with the need for a robust economy.

“I’ve got to believe that if you shut down harder, you’re going to see a more severe impact to your industries and the longer you’re shut down, the harder it’s going to be for those industries to rebound,” Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts told The Associated Press.

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, who tested positive for COVID-19 in September, has touted a balanced approach to coping with the pandemic. And Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds urged residents not to let the virus dominate their lives.

In South Dakota, Gov. Kristi Noem said: “There’s consequences to what we’ve seen happen in other states — that shutting down businesses, stopping people’s way of life has some devastating impacts. We’re taking a very balanced approach.”

In contrast, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has worked aggressively to tamp down the virus, including closing some businesses in the spring and imposing a mask mandate. Vermont now has one of the nation’s lowest COVID-19 infection rates along with the third-lowest unemployment rate.

Like the Midwestern states, Vermont is largely rural with industries that weren’t hurt as badly by the pandemic.

Economists say that’s not a coincidence, noting that states dominated by agriculture and some kinds of manufacturing were able to operate closer to normal and managed to bounce back more quickly. That contrasts with states that rely on tourism, such as California, Nevada and Hawaii, which have the nation’s highest unemployment rates.

“The economy of a rural state has a different structure, so more of the people work in industries that wouldn’t really be disrupted by a need for social distancing like agriculture,” said Eric Thompson, who leads the Bureau of Business Research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

The Midwestern states already had ultra-low unemployment rates before the pandemic, and they benefitted early on from a lack of population density, with plenty of wide-open spaces and few major cities where it would be harder to avoid catching the virus. More recently, though, many of those rural areas have seen some of the nation’s highest virus rates.

Even in industries like meatpacking that initially were devastated by workers catching COVID-19, the companies have managed to make changes that have allowed their operations to nearly return to normal.

Thompson said a lack of restrictions may have been most important in the spring. At the height of the shutdowns in April, Nebraska’s unemployment rate peaked at 8.7%, which was slightly more than half the national rate of 14.7% at that time.

Nathan Kauffman, Omaha branch executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said fewer businesses closed in these states because many of them are in what are considered essential industries.

Ricketts agreed that Nebraska’s mix of industries played a significant role in helping the state’s economy.

“The kinds of things that we’re strong in are agriculture, manufacturing, finance and technology. You’ve just got industries that are not going to be as impacted by a pandemic,” Ricketts said.

But even if business has remained better in these states, that doesn’t mean they have been completely spared. Restaurants, hotels and other types of businesses are still struggling because people remain wary of resuming their normal shopping patterns, and those economic costs could rise amid spikes in virus rates.

Despite the low unemployment figures, all of the states now have fewer jobs than before the pandemic hit. Nationally, the economy has regained only about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost.

Still, many Midwestern business owners and leaders say they appreciate their governors’ lighter touch.

In Rapid City, South Dakota, Black Hills Bagels never had to close because the wholesale side of its operation continued providing products to grocery stores, and its retail store turned to drive-thru and delivery options, owner Debra Jensen said. It even had trouble hiring the workers it needed this year because unemployment remained so low.

“I’m just happy that the state and the folks in South Dakota made the right decisions to make sure our economy didn’t just bottom out,” Jensen said.

Arik Spencer, president and CEO of the North Dakota Chamber of Commerce, said he doesn’t think shutting down the economy is the right approach, but every state is trying to help the economy while managing the virus.

“We hope that with the thoughtful approach of decisionmakers here in North Dakota, we’re poised to recover quickly. But if there was a silver bullet for recovery, every state in the country would be utilizing that right now,” Spencer said.

Coronavirus surging in every key swing state as voters head to polls,"Coronavirus surging in every key swing state as voters head to polls The impact on election results isn't clear, but the record turnout continues.

With Election Day just hours away, coronavirus cases are rising in every key political battleground state around the country, according to an ABC News analysis, a striking reality that highlights the inextricable link between the pandemic and the 2020 race for president, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to refocus the conversation elsewhere.

Deaths and hospitalizations are rising as well.

The outbreak is hitting in record numbers nationwide -- but the virus is spreading faster in cases per population in many hotly contested states, including Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Wisconsin and Texas, according to the analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.

Just this week, Pennsylvania, one of the most likely tipping points in the election, broke its single-day new case record this week with over cases 2,700 reported -- the highest since the start of the pandemic. In Wisconsin, there have been more than 150,000 new cases in just the past two months -- nearly double all the cases reported from March through the end of August combined.

And Georgia, which has emerged as a competitive state, is experiencing a ""surge.""

""Winter is coming,"" said Dr. Lynn Paxton, the health director in Fulton County, Georgia. ""We are clearly experiencing a surge in infections in Georgia.""

Exactly how the most recent rise in cases in key swing states, which began earlier this fall, will ultimately impact the presidential election remains unclear, but experts said its effects have already been felt. Many say the surge in cases is likely to hurt the president at the ballot box, though a Trump's campaign official Sunday suggested it may be to their advantage to have Democrats talking about it so much, as fear over the outbreak could prevent those more likely to support Biden from turning out on Election Day.

Record numbers of mail-in ballots have been requested, though, and early voting is smashing total tallies from 2016 and fears of getting the virus do not appear to be suppressing the drive to vote in person, even in places where cases are surging, experts said.

So the story of coronavirus in key swing states may be less of a case of what happens on Election Day than what preceded it.

How the pandemic may be affecting the race

For Trump, who has faced heavy criticism for his handling of the pandemic, the spike could continue to hurt his effort to shift focus to other topics and downplay its gravity.

Trump has repeatedly argued that the U.S. is ""rounding the turn"" with the virus, that a vaccine is ""weeks away,"" that the virus is not serious for the vast majority of people and other such claims. He and his supporters have also stressed that lockdowns associated with the virus, mainly in Democratic-led states, are doing more damage than the disease itself.

An ABC/News Washington Poll last week found that more than 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of the president's response to the pandemic.

""If this election is about Trump's handling of the pandemic, he's going to lose,"" Alex Conant, a political consultant and longtime Republican communications strategist who most recently worked on Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign, told ABC News.

""The biggest problem for Trump is all these headlines are keeping the pandemic front and center, when he wants to change the focus to the economy and Biden's shortcomings,"" he said.

But the rise in cases does not appear to be preventing voters from casting ballots, using mail, drop boxes, or early voting locations across the country.

More than 93 million people have already voted as of Sunday, according to data compiled by the U.S. Elections Project, with numerous states getting closer to breaking records ahead of Election Day.

Only 136.7 million votes were cast in 2016, according to the Federal Election Commission, so it's still unclear how many people will vote on Election Day.

Experts simply don't know if the pandemic will impact Election Day turnout for in-person voters.

""Certainly it makes intuitive sense that there could be a connection, but I just don't know for sure,"" said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

Some Trump counties in key swing states suffering

Though there is no clear correlation between the rising infection rates and the politics of a particular region, the numbers show that over the past two weeks, cases overall have risen faster in key counties won by Trump in 2016. In battleground states, Trump counties reported an average of 309 cases per 100,000 in the last two weeks, compared to 258 cases per 100,000 reported in counties won by Clinton.

In Iowa and Minnesota, the 10 counties with the highest infection rates as of last week were won by Trump in 2016.

In Wisconsin, nine of the 10 counties with the worst outbreaks were counties where Trump prevailed.

Since the spring, the virus has changed course in the U.S.

Coronavirus first decimated the heavily Democratic Northeast. After that it morphed into a more pervasive, but less deadly outbreak in the South in the summer.

The latter coincided with states reopening despite virus cases surging and the increasing politicization of masks and other mitigation measures.

And finally, the virus hit the rural areas that had largely been spared in the first two surges.

Despite the latest surge in the virus, the country has avoided the widespread lockdowns that characterized the spring.

""No question, if the coronavirus somehow magically never happened, this would be a very different election,"" Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, said on NBC on Sunday.

Jason Miller, a senior political adviser for the Trump campaign, said he believes Democrats could be suppressing turnout for their own voters by spending so much time emphasizing the virus.

""The thing that I would point out here that I think is really going to backfire on Democrats and many in the media is the Democrats have spent so many months telling folks that it's not safe to go out and vote in person on Tuesday,"" Miller said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""There's been so much media pressure effectively putting out scare tactics to keep folks away. Well, guess what? President Trump supporters are going to show up on Tuesday. Nothing is going to stop them.""

The virus expanded voting well beyond Election Day

In many states, the efforts to expand voting options ahead of Election Day appears to have already helped voters find safer routes to cast their ballots in the face of coronavirus risks.

""States have done a good job of creating an alternative to in person voting,"" Conant said. ""Across demographic groups, we're seeing high turnout, including areas that have spikes in the pandemic.""

In Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, another Trump county suffering from one of the worst rates of COVID cases in the state, County Clerk Jon Dolson told ABC News that ""several municipalities had lines of people on the first day of in-person absentee voting,"" mostly of people who didn't want to stand in line on Election Day, even though ""with all of the absentee voting, there won't be lines on election day.""

In Texas, which is considered to be competitive for Joe Biden, cases are ""rising quickly,"" according to the state health department, with the state averaging over 6,000 new cases per day in the last week. However, election officials say the rise in cases has not deterred voters from casting their ballots at the polls, or by other more unconventional methods, such as drive-thru voting. On Sunday, the Texas Supreme Court denied a petition by a group of Republicans, who sought to invalidate nearly 127,000 drive-thru votes in Harris County.

In fact, while the seven-day average of new cases in El Paso has surged by more than 550% just in the last month alone, voter participation has actually gone up.

People are ""overcoming the fear of COVID-19 to go out and vote,"" said Antonio Rivera, assistant elections administrator for El Paso County.

Texas has already cast well over the number of votes that it did in 2016, according to the U.S. Elections Project, and several states are close to exceeding their total for that year as well.

Health and election officials across the country have made extensive preparations to ensure safe in-person voting in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic. Many are providing workers and voters with personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand sanitizer, and nearly all health officials ABC News spoke to last week feel their state can conduct elections in a safe manner. At least 33 states will ask voters to wear masks at polling locations, according to an ABC News survey.

In Wisconsin, where experts said COVID-19 hospitalization could double in the next 2-6 weeks, hospitalized or quarantined patients are being asked to designate an agent to pick up and drop off their ballots.

Shauntay Nelson, the state director of All Voting is Local, a progressive group working to get out the vote in Wisconsin, told ABC News that the coronavirus has motivated voters in the state even more.

""I've driven around to some of the early voting sites, and I've seen an energy and an excitement especially among Black and brown people,"" Nelson said.

""What I've noticed is a tenacity to not be denied the power to vote, a tenacity from people who have been suppressed for years and years, who are making a decision to say I will not allow any form of suppression to stop my vote.""

WHO director goes into self-quarantine after contact with person exposed to COVID-19,"WHO director goes into self-quarantine after contact with person exposed to COVID-19 Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he will work from home.

The director of the World Health Organization tweeted Sunday he will go into self-quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he is well and not showing symptoms but will be working from home as a precaution.

""It is critically important that we all comply with health guidance. This is how we will break chains of #COVID19 transmission, suppress the virus, and protect health systems,"" he tweeted

Tedros has been the face of WHO's response to the pandemic since the beginning of the year and has been working with government leaders and scientists to control the virus and work on creating a vaccine. He has received criticism from President Donald Trump, who accused the WHO of not being tough enough on China following its late response to the virus.

Tedros and other WHO leaders have urged for unity among the world leaders.

Germany launches 4-week partial shutdown to curb virus,"Germany launches 4-week partial shutdown to curb virus A four-week partial shutdown has started in Germany, with restaurants, bars, theaters, cinemas and other leisure facilities closing down until the end of the month in a drive to flatten a rapid rise in coronavirus infections

BERLIN -- A four-week partial shutdown has started in Germany, with restaurants, bars, theaters, cinemas and other leisure facilities closing down until the end of the month in a drive to flatten a rapid rise in coronavirus infections.

The restrictions that took effect Monday are milder than the ones Germany imposed in the first phase of the pandemic in March and April. This time around, schools, kindergartens, non-essential shops and hairdressers are to remain open.

But leading officials decided last week that a “lockdown light” was necessary in light of a sharp rise in cases that has prompted many other European countries to impose more or less drastic restrictions.

On Saturday, the national disease control center reported the highest number of infections in one day -- 19,059 -- since the pandemic began. Figures at the beginning of the week tend to be lower, and the center reported 12,097 cases Monday. But that compared with 8,685 a week earlier, underlining the upward trend.

Germany has reported over 100 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past week. That is fewer than in many other European countries, but far above the 50 mark that officials set earlier this year as an alarm signal that requires action by local authorities.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors are to review the situation after two weeks and discuss whether the measures need to be adjusted.

“The aim is to get back under this level of 50 at which health offices are in a position to trace contacts,” Merkel's chief of staff, Helge Braun, told RBB Inforadio.

Merkel said last week that authorities are currently unable to trace the source of three-quarters of infections.

The restrictions taking effect Monday allow groups of at most 10 people, from a maximum two households, in public. Germans have been asked to refrain from making non-essential journeys and hotels are barred from accommodating people on tourist trips.

Asked whether the restrictions might last beyond November, Braun replied: “Our declared aim is that we want to end the measures in this strictness at the end of November.”

“This is also about enabling Christmas business for German companies, and Christmas celebrations with the family for all of us,” he added. “I consider that important ... the stricter the measures, the quicker they work, so we decided on relatively strict measures.”",,
"Nursing homes, after seeing improvements, now face a fresh COVID-19 threat","Nursing homes, after seeing improvements, now face a fresh COVID-19 threat ""Our system is collapsing,"" says a Wisconsin advocate for the elderly.

Nursing homes across the country are bracing for a dark winter as rising coronavirus infections appear to be reversing trends that had showed an improved outlook for the nation's most vulnerable, an ABC News review of state-by-state numbers reveals.

""As case counts rise in communities around the country, nursing homes and providers in other congregate care settings are under siege,"" said Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of LeadingAge, the association of nonprofit providers of aging services. ""Despite the improvements in testing, older adults in nursing homes -- and in all care settings -- continue to be under threat from this pandemic.""

Overall, the toll on seniors has been grim. Through late October, coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have now topped 82,000 in the 41 states for which figures were available, according to ABC News' analysis of state-released data.

The figures appear to show that nursing homes saw significant improvements late in the summer, with cases in those settings making up a smaller percentage of the overall infections in most states. By August, nursing home deaths were also increasing at a much slower rate as a percentage of overall infections.

Those gains reflected steady improvements in the ability of doctors to intervene and treat COVID-19 infections before they became life-threatening, experts said. Nursing homes were testing more frequently, isolating infected residents earlier, and using better therapies to treat the illness, several industry officials told ABC News.

""Testing has made a significant difference in our ability to manage and contain the virus,"" said Dr. Mark Gloth, chief medical officer at ProMedica Senior Care, one of the nation's largest residential nursing care providers with more than 300 nursing, assisted-living and hospice care facilities.

In-house testing has made it easier to spot contagious residents before they show symptoms, Gloth said, adding that the benefits of earlier intervention are most notable because over 50% of the positive cases they have seen have been asymptomatic.

""Our mortality rate continues to decline significantly,"" Gloth said. But in the last two weeks, he said the company has seen ""isolated increases"" as coronavirus cases have surged in large swaths of the country.

National figures compiled by ABC News indicate that earlier positive trends in the industry overall may be backsliding.

In Maryland, where the percentage of the state's coronavirus deaths among those in nursing homes had been steadily dropping, the figure rose from a low of 32% in August to 53% by the end of October. In Oregon, where nursing home deaths made up fewer than half of the state's COVID-19 deaths, they now make up more than 57% of the state's overall coronavirus death totals.

In New York, the number of new nursing home deaths has remained low compared to some of the other states where the death count has been raging, but there has been a recent surge in nursing home deaths in the last few weeks. More the twice the number of new nursing home deaths were reported in the last four weeks compared to the previous four weeks.

The number of cases in Arkansas nursing homes has tripled from September to October, while deaths have increased by almost a third. In Delaware, nursing homes saw cases increase in October and saw a third more deaths than in the previous month. Texas, Utah and West Virginia all saw similar trend lines, with the ratio of nursing home deaths on the rise by late October, after having seen a dip through August.

""As we move into a second wave, we need to make sure we apply lessons from earlier in the pandemic to curb transmission and save lives,"" said Dr. Jay Bhatt, a practicing internist and ABC News contributor. ""Infection prevention and prevention measures used by staff and residents will be critical in the coming months.""

One significant challenge, Bhatt said, will come as nursing homes shut down access to residents' relatives and friends at a time many have only recently loosened restrictions. Social isolation, he said, has been associated with about a 50% percent increased risk of dementia.

""I'm deeply concerned about the continued isolation that older adults face in nursing homes,"" Bhatt said.

Last week, one of the nation's largest nursing home industry advocacy groups sent out an alert about the ""threat of a third spike,"" saying many providers ""still need essential resources such as personal protective equipment and testing."" The American Health Care Association said that one in five facilities were dangerously low on items like gloves and hand sanitizer.

""The shortages actually became more grave as the summer went on,"" according to a recent study by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group cited in the industry alert, ""with three times as many nursing homes reporting they were completely out of masks, gowns and eye protection in late August, compared with mid-July.""

In Wisconsin, where overall coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths are all rising rapidly, the percentage of fatalities occurring in nursing homes is also going back up. After dropping to as low as 15% of all deaths in August, that rate doubled to 30% in October.

That month, John Sauer, the president of advocacy group LeadingAge Wisconsin, wrote to the head of the federal agency that regulates nursing care and pleaded for more assistance.

""Our members are facing an unprecedented crisis and, with our State's exponential surge in COVID-19 cases, this crisis is intensifying, threatening facilities' ability to serve current residents or accept new admissions from our acute-care partners,"" Sauer wrote. ""In short, the Wisconsin long-term care safety net is unraveling. Our system is collapsing, and we need your help.""

A pandemic of the novel coronavirus has now killed more than 1.2 million people worldwide.

Over 46.5 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some national governments are hiding or downplaying the scope of their outbreaks. The criteria for diagnosis -- through clinical means or a lab test -- has also varied from country to country.

Since the first cases were detected in China in December, the virus has rapidly spread to every continent except Antarctica. The United States is the worst-affected nation, with more than 9.2 million diagnosed cases and at least 231,003 deaths.

Election 2020: Why voting in the coronavirus pandemic will be unlike any other year,"Election 2020: Why voting in the coronavirus pandemic will be unlike any other year Voting by mail is ""going to be the real story of this cycle,"" one expert said.

This year's general election is shaping up to be one for the history books. Between anticipated mail-in ballot records, early voting surges and a slew of novel coronavirus-related safety precautions, the global pandemic has shaped almost every facet of voting.

State and local election officials have been gearing up for this most unusual election cycle for months. With early voting already underway in all 50 states, here's what voters can expect leading up to Nov. 3, and beyond.

Mail-in voting surge

Often a service used by those living overseas, such as the military, but increasing in popularity, mail-in voting has taken on new significance in the pandemic, with more than 80 million requested so far in this general election cycle, double the previous presidential election and more than half the total vote cast in 2016.

As of Oct. 14, more than 1.5 million vote-by-mail ballots have been returned in California -- far surpassing the 150,000 at the same point in the season in 2016 -- according to the Secretary of State's office. That's in a state that already had a significant percentage of voters who chose to cast ballots by mail. This year, the state also decided to mail ballots to all active voters for the first time -- one of the major ways voting by mail has been made more accessible for this year's election.

Voting by mail is ""going to be the real story of this cycle,"" Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told ABC News. ""The jump from 2016 to 2020 is going to be huge,"" he said.

In the 2016 general election, 33,378,450 absentee ballots were returned, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission -- representing 23.7% of all ballots cast.

Based on evidence from primary elections since COVID-19 lockdowns began, the Bipartisan Policy Center estimated that 50% to 70% of all ballots cast will be absentee this year. Weil now estimates that number to be on the lower end of that range, noting that ""even 50% will be a huge increase over 2016.""

For the general election, at least 30 states plus the District of Columbia have made at least some changes that will make it easier and more accessible for voters to cast their ballots from home. These changes include removing strict excuse requirements or allowing COVID-19 concerns to be a valid excuse to vote absentee, allowing ballot drop boxes, offering prepaid postage on election mail and proactively sending all active registered voters applications to request an absentee ballot -- with some, such as California, skipping that step and sending the actual ballots.

Unlike in elections past, there's also a partisan preference for mail-in ballots, Weil noted. Nearly 10 million more registered Democrats have requested absentee ballots compared to registered Republicans, according to the U.S. Elections Project out of the University of Florida.

Adding to the complexities this year are President Donald Trump's repeated attempts to sow doubt on mail-in voting through false and conspiratorial claims about voter fraud. Legal experts told ABC News there hasn't been evidence of widespread or systematic voter fraud with mail voting.

Voters should be wary of making mistakes with their mail-in ballots. In the 2016 general election, around 1% -- 318,728 -- of absentee ballots were rejected, according to the Election Assistance Commission. The most common reasons for rejection were ""missing the deadline, the signature on the ballot not matching the signature on the state’s records, and the ballot not having a signature,"" the commission said.

That rejection rate remained small overall in 2018, but growing, at 1.4%, according to an ABC News analysis.

""With a lot of voters voting in a different way than they ever had before,"" Weil said, ""are we going to see a higher number of these absentee ballots rejected?""

Long lines vs. long waits

With early voting already underway in every state, some counties have seen record-breaking numbers of in-person voters.

Amid the historic turnout, long lines have been reported at some polling locations -- though experts are quick to point out that long lines might not necessarily mean long wait times, and voters should not be deterred from voting as a result.

""Long lines are not necessarily a bad thing,"" Hannah Klain, a fellow with the nonpartisan law and policy institute Brennan Center for Justice, told ABC News. ""It hopefully does mean that the polling site is enforcing social distancing, that people are keeping their distance when they are waiting in line to vote, that only so many people are being allowed into the voting space at a time in order to manage the crowds.""

A snaking line could seem daunting, but ""don't let a long line deter you,"" she said. Voters should be prepared to see them, Weil added.

That doesn't mean that long wait times aren't a concern, Klain said, and election officials may need to sort those out throughout the early voting process. Because of the coronavirus, there may be limits on the number of voting machines at polling sites to avoid too many people being inside at one time. When early voting got underway in Georgia last week, some wait times reached five hours. Counties that had long lines were working to add more voting equipment where possible, officials said last week.

Some counties in states including Texas, North Carolina and Nevada are implementing online wait-time technology so you can see the anticipated wait at your polling site.

""It is a more forward-looking use of technology in our election sphere,"" Klain said. ""That's exciting to see, and helpful, especially in a year where, again, we're seeing high levels of turnout.""

Both Klain and Weil recommend that voters who intend to vote in person should vote early if they can.

""If people show up and the wait time is so long that they can't wait, you can always come back on another day of early voting,"" Klain said. ""Election Day is a totally different story. You only get one bite of that apple.""

If weather is a concern, you also can avoid waiting outside on a potentially cold or rainy Nov. 3 by voting earlier, Weil said.

""We should try to take as much pressure off of Election Day at the polling places as possible,"" he said. ""If individually we can all make that decision, I think the entire election season will go better.""

New safety precautions

Socially distanced lines aren't the only safety measures in play this election cycle. Plexiglass petitions between voters and poll workers, hand sanitizing stations and curbside voting options are just some of the new sights voters may encounter while voting during a pandemic.

The Bipartisan Policy Center partnered with the Cleveland Clinic to provide voting safety guidance this year. Their recommendations include ""bringing your own supplies, such as hand sanitizer, an ink pen for paper ballots, or a stylus for touchscreen machines."" Just make sure to verify with an election official before using your own supplies, they note.

Precautions may vary by state and even county. The Brennan Center has been working closely with Harris County in Texas, where new measures this election cycle include disposable plastic finger covers to wear while touching voting machines.

""We're seeing innovations like that across the country,"" Klain said. ""I do think county election officials are doing their best to keep people safe.""

Among recommendations it issued with Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Brennan Center also advises that voters avoid bringing any unnecessary people, such as children or other non-voting eligible family members, to the voting location.

""We want to limit the number of people who are at the polls to just those who need to cast a ballot,"" Klain said.

Make a plan -- and stick to it

If you're unsure about the current voting rules in your area, Weil recommends heading to canivote.org, run by the National Association of Secretaries of State, for the latest information.

""I think that is the gold standard,"" he said. ""You want voters to be turning to their state election officials.""

With so many changes and, in some cases, legal challenges regarding voting this year due to the pandemic, Klain recommends figuring out when you're going to vote, then double checking information such as polling locations and hours with local election offices.

""Things are even changing in real-time,"" she said. ""We want to make sure that people have the most accurate and up-to-date information when they're making decisions and making a voting plan.""

Whether you've decided to already vote by mail-in ballot or early in-person, Weil recommends sticking to it to avoid increasing the burden of election officials. For instance, if you've requested an absentee ballot but then decide to vote in person, that takes more time and puts more pressure on the check-in system.

If planning to vote in person, prep ahead: Pack supplies such as a mask, hand sanitizer, ink pen or a stylus and any relevant voting materials.

When to expect results

On a general election night, Americans are accustomed to knowing who's won the presidency and other races relatively quickly through projections made by news organizations. But with record absentee ballots anticipated, there is a concern that some states, especially battlegrounds, could be overwhelmed with counting ballots on Election Day.

Rules for processing and counting absentee ballots vary from state to state, ranging from some that allow immediate processing and counting of absentee ballots when they are submitted, to those that do not start counting them until Election Day. Some rules have changed temporarily to accommodate the increase anticipated for the pandemic, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

For Weil, there haven't been significant changes to state election laws to allow election officials to count those ballots earlier, given increases in absentee voting.

As a result, it could be a while before the results of the presidential election are final, with some experts predicting the process could last for at least a couple of weeks.

""It's going to serve voters well on election night, so it's not a big shock,"" Weil said, to know that ""there might not be a call.""

There are guidelines in place in the event the election is not decided on Election Night. This year, states have until Dec. 8 to file final election results if they want to insulate themselves from legal disputes. Usually this process, governed by obscure 19th-century law, is not much more than an afterthought, but the potential complexities of counting the vote this year as well as the prospect of legal challenges have added a new wrinkle. The Electoral College will then meet on Dec. 14 to formally cast their votes for the president.

Officials have urged Congress to move these deadlines back to avoid a potential crisis.",,
"Crushed by the virus, 2 mall operators file for bankruptcy","NEW YORK -- Two mall operators filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, hurt by the coronavirus pandemic that has forced their tenants to permanently close stores or not pay rent.

Both companies, CBL and Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, said their malls will remain open as they go through the bankruptcy process.

Even before the virus, malls have struggled to attract shoppers who are increasingly shopping online or elsewhere. But the pandemic forced many of them to temporarily close for months. Mall tenants, which operators rely on for rent payments, are also stressed. Some are going bankrupt and closing stores, such as department store chain J.C. Penney.

The two bankruptcies come just before the crucial holiday shopping season. With reported coronavirus cases rising, malls will need to limit crowds during what is traditionally their busiest times of the year. At the same time, big retailers that didn't have to close during the pandemic, such as Amazon, Target and Walmart, are benefiting as they push people to shop online.

CBL, which operates 107 malls, said more than 30 of its tenants have filed for bankruptcy protection this year and are shutting stores, including woman's clothing retailer Ascena, which has 100 Ann Taylor, LOFT and other stores in CBL malls. Based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, CBL operates malls across the U.S., including EastGate Mall in Cincinnati and West County Center in St. Louis.

PREIT, based in Philadelphia, has more than 20 properties, including Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and Viewmont Mall in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Like other malls looking to attract shoppers, PREIT has added restaurants, movie theaters and gyms to its malls in recent years, which now account for about 24% of its tenants. But those establishments have been hit harder by the pandemic and have stricter rules on how many people can visit.

PREIT said more stores are paying rent now than earlier this year, but it still expects its revenue from rent to continue to suffer as long as COVID-19 affects ""the return of customers to malls.”",,

Utah epidemiologist latest target of attacks on health officials by anti-science protesters,"Utah epidemiologist latest target of attacks on health officials by anti-science protesters ""People feel that it is OK to harass civil servants. It’s wrong.""

A dozen unmasked protesters carrying American flags stood outside the home of Utah's state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn, Thursday, after Dunn's address was leaked online.

""Take the fight to these job recking [sic] economy busting TYRANTS HOMES!"" one Facebook commenter said in response to an online flyer featuring Dunn's home address, Salt Lake City ABC affiliate KTVX reported.

""Hold their feet to the fire so they know WE ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE!!!!,"" commenters wrote.

""It’s scary and wrong that someone would feel comfortable sharing my personal information,"" Dunn said during a news conference Thursday after the protest.

""It’s taken a really big toll on my family and myself and they’re supposed to be there again tonight. I think it’s really unfortunate that we live in a state where people feel that it is OK to harass civil servants. It’s wrong.""

Doxxing, or publicly broadcasting private information about individuals or organizations, is just the latest threat against health officials since the pandemic began.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's most high-profile infectious disease expert and member of the White House coronavirus task force, has received death threats, as have his adult daughters.

Less well-known public health officials around the country, many of them women, have been targeted and harassed.

Female health officials in Ohio, Washington, Georgia, California and Florida have been on the receiving end of online and in-person harassment. Ohio protesters, some of whom were armed, went to the state health department director's home with sexist and antisemitic signs. Less than a month later, the director resigned.

Tech mogul Elon Musk railed against a female county health official this spring, tweeting that the official was ""ignorant,"" after his factory was subject to a pandemic lockdown order.

""Someone very casually suggested that I should be shot"" during a Facebook Live event, recalled Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer. Americans are angry about the impact of the pandemic, Ferrer previously told ABC News.

They are ""looking for somebody to blame -- and found a target,"" she added.

In reality, the United States' outbreak has never looked more dire.

The 7-day rolling average for new COVID-19 cases in the United States reached its third peak on Wednesday, with 74,095 infections. As of Friday, 228,909 Americans had died of the virus.

By every measurable metric: new cases, hospitalizations, testing positivity rate and deaths, the outbreak is worsening, experts say.

President Trump's split with health advisers on coronavirus fuels speculation of shake-up,"President Trump's split with health advisers on coronavirus fuels speculation of shake-up CDC Director Redfield said he's committed to an agency ""grounded in data.""

As the novel coronavirus tightens its grip on the nation, President Donald Trump is insisting that Americans are ready to move past the crisis -- a message almost entirely at odds with his own top health advisers, who continue to warn the toughest months lie ahead.

The fractured messaging has invited speculation that if Trump is reelected he would consider purging political appointees at the federal agencies leading the nation's response to the virus in favor of loyalists who share his worldview.

""We're doing very well with respect to making the turn on the pandemic,"" Trump declared again on Friday, comments he made last April and again in July, even as death rates have climbed. He later added that the corner would be rounded without the vaccine.

""You know, without it, we're still rounding the corner,"" he told a crowd in Michigan. ""We have [a vaccine]. But without it, we'll round the corner.""

Just days earlier, Adm. Brett Giroir, Trump's appointee to coordinate COVID testing and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said something entirely different.

""I just want to be straight with the listeners that we are not going to completely defeat the virus until we get a vaccine, and that vaccine is distributed to the American people,"" Giroir told reporters on a press call. ""And we build up herd immunity in the appropriate way by getting a vaccine.""

When asked if Trump is considering shaking up his appointees in another term, White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern would only say that Trump and the task force have been working together to end the pandemic since the beginning.

""Their actions have ensured that our country will defeat the virus and safely reopen,"" he said.

As Trump stares down a potential four more years in the White House, the president is clearly ready for a reset after months of the virus dragging down the economy and frightening voters. When he speaks about the virus on the trail, it's almost entirely on political terms -- insisting Democrat Joe Biden would shutter the country and destroy the economy while teasing mask wearers as ""politically correct.""

While his top advisers deliver an entirely different message -- that the country is at a dangerous tipping point and that masks and social distancing are the best available option -- the question then becomes what Trump will do with his own federal task force on coronavirus after the election, especially if he is reelected.

Dr. Deborah Birx, who is in charge of coordinating the task force, no longer briefs the public from the White House and has instead been doing her job almost entirely from the road, visiting state houses and meeting with local health officials. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Health Secretary Alex Azar, both members of the task force, held a rare press conference at CDC headquarters in Atlanta last week to sound the alarms.

""The pandemic is not over,"" Redfield declared.

Citing several administration sources, The Washington Post reported on Friday that Redfield is expected to leave or be asked to resign shortly after the election, no matter the result. ABC News could not immediately confirm the report.

In a statement to ABC News, Redfield praised the agency workforce, adding, ""I will do everything in my power to support them as I maintain my commitment to lead this agency grounded in data, science, and public service.""

Another open question is the fate of Stephen Hahn, the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which will decide when a vaccine is ready for public consumption. He reportedly provoked the ire of the White House this month when he insisted upon tough new guidance for vaccine makers to ensure their vaccines are safe. The White House dropped their objection.

Trump tweeted at Hahn earlier this month, calling his regulatory decision a ""political hit job.""

""New FDA Rules make it more difficult for them to speed up vaccines for approval before Election Day. Just another political hit job! @SteveFDA,"" Trump tweeted.

Hahn never responded directly to the president, but continues to defend his work.

""We're not going to rush something that's so important to get right. There will be no shortcuts to our standards for product quality, safety, and efficacy,"" Hahn tweeted this week.

Trump has often relied on advisement from radiologist Scott Atlas from Stanford's Hoover Institute. Atlas advocates for the idea of allowing the virus to spread rapidly among healthy populations while shielding more vulnerable groups -- an idea that the nation's top public health experts say is nearly impossible and would result in unacceptable death tolls.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has repeatedly shot down the idea of trying to embrace ""herd immunity"" without a vaccine as ""nonsense.""

He warned this week the nation could be on track to hit 100,000 cases a day and half a million deaths by February unless the country takes the virus more seriously.

As a career employee who has served across multiple administrations, Fauci could not be pushed out easily by Trump.

""We've got to work together as a country. We've all got to be on the same page; we've got to pull together to do something about this,"" he said in an interview this week with Rolling Stone editor Jeff Goodell.

The split viewpoints come as the numbers in the U.S. are grim. There are 43 states and territories on an upward trajectory with cases, while a quarter of the nation's hospitals report that 80% of beds in intensive care units are filled.

On deaths -- the same day Donald Trump Jr. claimed the number fell to ""almost nothing"" -- 1,049 Americans died due to complications from COVID-19.

Public health officials tracking the epidemic say the total number of deaths -- at least 229,293 as of Friday afternoon -- is likely undercounted because many cases probably aren't being reported and people are going undiagnosed.

According to the CDC, the U.S. experienced more than 299,000 excess deaths this year compared to mortality rate in prior years.",,
"Amid pandemic, hospitals warned of 'credible' and 'imminent' cyberthreat","Amid pandemic, hospitals warned of 'credible' and 'imminent' cyberthreat Federal agencies alerted hospitals to possible ransomware attacks.

The FBI, CISA and HHS are warning of an upcoming ransomware attack on hospitals.

“CISA, FBI, and HHS have credible information of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers. CISA, FBI, and HHS are sharing this information to provide warning to healthcare providers to ensure that they take timely and reasonable precautions to protect their networks from these threats,” a warning from the agencies said.

The agencies say that the malware “Trickbot” is the primary method used to attack hospitals.

According to the technology firm ForcePoint, malware is ""short for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network.""

According to the firm, the attacks usually start in the form of a suspicious email.

“CISA, FBI, and HHS assess malicious cyber actors are targeting the HPH Sector with Trickbot malware, often leading to ransomware attacks, data theft, and the disruption of healthcare services,” they say.

The agencies said that because of the targeted nature of these attacks hospital workers should be on alert for phishing scams and ransomware attacks.

Best practices include patching networks, changing passwords and multi-factor authentication. The three agencies also said hospital systems should be prepared and should have a risk mitigation plan that can easily be activated.

In particular, the agencies warn about the use of Ryuk ransomware and according to the alert, allow for the hacker to freeze computer systems until a monetary amount is paid.

On Thursday, research group SonicWall Capture Labs revealed that Ryuk Ransomware accounts for one third of all ransomware used through the world.

In September, one of the country's largest hospital chains said that all 250 of its locations had been hit with a ransomware attack.

United Health Services said that it ""have had no indication that any patient or employee data was accessed, copied or misused.""",,
5 things states must do to curb the spread of COVID-19: ANALYSIS,"5 things states must do to curb the spread of COVID-19: ANALYSIS Cases are on the rise throughout much of the U.S.

The dreaded fall and winter COVID-19 wave has arrived and with a vengeance. Much of the nation is experiencing a viral load of infections unlike those previously seen since the start of the pandemic.

Any one metric by itself doesn't fully relay the significance of the threat, but coupling it with multiple metrics, like the number of daily new cases, percent positivity rate, infection rate, hospitalization rate and deaths, provide a more complete burden of the illness.

There are 50 epidemics playing out in the United States, each state with its own trajectory and prognosis. Only two states, Maine and Vermont, are trending in the right direction, having control on their epidemic, the remaining 48 states are all trending in the wrong direction.

To curb the spread of COVID-19, these are five measures that must be taken to prevent further amplification of cases, illnesses, hospitalizations and death.

1. Mandate face masks

The verdict is in, masks work. In a study published in Health Affairs, mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia led to a slower daily COVID-19 growth rate that was seen over time.

Currently across the nation, 49% of Americans wear a mask in public, with only some states mandating wearing a face covering. If we increase this to 95%, we could save 129,000 lives, the study said.

2. Better risk communication on preventative measures

Communication can make or break any medical response. Countries, like those in Asia, that have been able to curtail the spread of COVID-19 have showcased effective risk communication with the general public -- that is -- telling the public in layman's terms the good, the bad, the ugly and what we don't know yet.

Even more important is saying it with one voice, not mixed messages that erodes trust. During a time when many Americans are experiencing pandemic fatigue, are confused about the evolving science of COVID-19 and want to resume pre-pandemic activities, providing coherent, consistent and reliable guidance has never been more important.

Reliable guidance includes communicating what constitutes low-risk activities (outdoor events) versus high-risk activities (indoors, confined space and poor ventilation), as well as reminding people to stay home when sick, and continue physical distancing and hand-washing.

3. Surveillance at the local level

Early in this pandemic, the nation was blinded by the number of COVID-19 cases that were brewing in our communities. Fast forward 10 months, and we've learned a lot about this disease and the various indicators that can help track and trace where the virus is spreading.

Each jurisdiction should have surveillance systems in place that track levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation and associated illness before they reach alarming levels.

Consistent data should be collected on outpatient and emergency department visits for influenza-like illnesses and COVID-like illnesses, in addition to the number of new daily cases, tests performed, percent positivity rate, hospitalizations and deaths, among other indicators.

4. Hyper-local response and prioritizing low to high-risk activities

Data that's collected through surveillance systems can help inform local decisions and actions to prevent cases from becoming clusters, clusters from becoming outbreaks and outbreaks from becoming epidemics.

Through a hyper-local response model, pre-set benchmarks and associated actions can be established that prioritize curbing activities that pose the highest risk of transmission in order to contain a local outbreak. This includes looking at outdoors or curbside pickup versus indoor dining, limiting gatherings and closing high-risk nonessential businesses.

5. Testing and contact tracing

The mantra has always been ""test, isolate, trace and quarantine.""

In order to find cases, there must be an adequate testing infrastructure. States should aim for at least 150 new tests per 100,000 population with associated test positivity rate being below 5%.

There must also be an adequate contact tracing workforce to track and trace additional cases and contacts. The aim should be at least 30 contact tracers per 100,000 people in each state and the ability to scale up if the epidemic expands.

State leaders facing 2nd wave resist steps to curb virus,"State leaders facing 2nd wave resist steps to curb virus Officials in many U.S. states being hit hard by the coronavirus are resisting taking stronger action to stop the spread, even as a fall resurgence strains hospitals

DES MOINES, Iowa -- Even as a new surge of coronavirus infections sweeps the U.S., officials in many hard-hit states are resisting taking stronger action to slow the spread, with pleas from health experts running up against political calculation and public fatigue.

Days before a presidential election that has spotlighted President Donald Trump's scattershot response to the pandemic, the virus continued its resurgence Friday, with total confirmed cases in the U.S. surpassing 9 million.

The number of new infections reported daily is on the rise in 47 states. They include Nebraska and South Dakota, where the number of new cases topped previous highs for each state.

The record increases in new cases have eclipsed the spikes that set off national alarms last spring and summer. During those outbreaks, first in the Northeast and then in Sun Belt states, many governors closed schools and businesses and restricted public gatherings.

But this fall's resurgence of the virus, despite being far more widespread, has brought a decidedly more limited response in many states. Most are led by Republican governors backing a president who insists, falsely, that the country is getting the virus under control.

Over the past two weeks, more than 76,000 new virus cases have been reported daily in the U.S. on average, up from about 54,000 in mid-October, according to Johns Hopkins University. Deaths, which usually lag case numbers and hospitalizations, are also rising, from about 700 to more than 800 a day.

The virus has now killed more than 229,000 Americans.

Nevertheless, many officials have resisted calls to enact measures like statewide mask mandates or stricter curbs on the size of gatherings, casting the response to the virus as a matter of individual decision-making.

“At the end of the day, personal responsibility is the only way. People will either choose or not choose to social distance, or choose to wear a mask or not,” said Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican. “What we can do is to remind them is that personal responsibility can protect them.”

Lee's state is among those without a blanket mask mandate despite a study released this week showing that areas of Tennessee where people are not required to wear them are seeing the most hospitalizations.

In Iowa, where a record 606 coronavirus patients were hospitalized Friday, one health expert said officials there had been too quick to reopen, along with several neighboring states.

“If we follow the course that the other Midwestern states like Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota have, we’re going to have trouble keeping up,” said Dr. Ravi Vemuri, an infectious disease specialist at MercyOne hospitals.

Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has rejected mask requirements and said Iowans must learn to live with the virus, continued this week to downplay efforts to contain it.

On Wednesday, Reynolds, who has made frequent campaign appearances for Trump and other candidates surrounded by crowds of often maskless supporters, poked fun at Theresa Greenfield, a Democrat running in a tight Senate race, for suspending a campaign tour after a staff member was exposed to someone who tested positive.

“Theresa didn’t get very far on her RV tour, did she?” Reynolds said. She went on to accuse Greenfield and other Democrats of “hiding in their basements.”

The pandemic has put similar pressures on states with Democratic governors, but the politics have played out differently.

Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, has repeatedly tried to impose restrictions but been stymied by the Republican-controlled legislature. She is considering calling lawmakers into a special session to impose a statewide mask mandate.

In Wisconsin, where the virus has raged since September, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers pleaded with residents this week to shelter in place to slow the spread. Evers issued a formal stay-at-home order in March, but the state's conservative Supreme Court struck it down in May. He was subsequently sued over a mask mandate and limits on gatherings in bars and restaurants.

The parrying by governors and legislators reflect the way that politics and the personal beliefs of a significant sector of the population have become entangled with supposedly nonpartisan matters of public health.

Michelle Riipinen, a 38-year-old resident of Boise, Idaho, said state-mandated school closings, business shutdowns and mask requirements are “draconian measures” that do more harm than good. She said she chooses not to wear a mask.

“I believe in personal responsibility and that it is our responsibility as American citizens to choose if we want to wear it or not,” she said. “Our government shouldn’t be making that choice for us.”

In Utah, Republican Gov. Gary Herbert has ordered mask mandates and limited social gatherings to 10 people or fewer only in counties with the highest transmission rates, not the entire state. The latter measure includes exceptions for religious services and school events.

“This is not an easy thing to enforce. As you drive down the road, you talk about people getting tickets for speeding, but how many are actually speeding?"" Herbert said when asked about his resistance to broader mandates.

Herbert said Friday he was “disgusted” after someone shot at a state health department office. The incident came a day after anti-mask protesters gathered outside the home of Utah state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn, who recommended that the state reinstate restrictions to avoid overwhelming hospitals.

“It’s taken a really big toll on my family and myself,” Dunn said. “I think it’s really unfortunate we live in a state where people feel that it is OK to harass civil servants.”

Herbert, who has not heeded Dunn's recommendation, said protesters were within their rights to criticize him or other elected officials, but that they should leave state employees alone.

""I know we’re asking a lot of the people of Utah to be patient,” the governor said. “We know that their time is valuable. I would hope that they would put that in a constructive effort.”

New York City Marathon goes virtual during coronavirus pandemic,"New York City Marathon goes virtual during coronavirus pandemic The virtual race can include augmented reality and the sound of crowds.

NEW YORK -- The New York City Marathon is one of the city's biggest events of the year, attracting tens of thousands of runners from more than 100 countries around the world to the Big Apple to try to complete a daunting 26.2-mile run.

Normally, the New York Road Runners' flagship race traverses five bridges as it takes participants through all five of the city's boroughs. But this year, with the COVID-19 pandemic preventing large gatherings, everything is going to be just a little bit different.

NYRR's Senior Vice President of Strategic Partnerships and Runner Products Christine Burke says the decision was made in June to cancel the in-person run.

""Fortunately, we already had plans in the works to do a virtual marathon,"" she explained. ""This will be our third year of staging a virtual version of the marathon. And we're fortunate that we have experience with it now. And so, we already had plans to do a virtual marathon, but with the cancelation of the in-person race at the end of June, we knew we had to make the virtual version bigger and better than it had ever been.""

Chris Baker has run the New York City Marathon several times and initially wasn't sure he'd take part in the virtual festivities.

""I was very skeptical because for me, what's attractive is the actual competitive nature of seeing my friends in the corrals ... and actually competing with them. And a virtual race is kind of like the opposite of that, you're kind of just running by yourself, recording your time, and submitting it,"" he said.

But Baker says he decided to run this year, not for himself, but for the city.

""Running the virtual marathon for me, is a way to kind of show people, look at what's going on in New York, things are good, we're trying to get back to normal, and this is one way we can do it.""

Listen to the full interview and the rest of this past week's highlights here.

The NYRR has followed through on their efforts to make the virtual race special, with the help the running app Strava.

""There is technology that we're using this year,"" Burke told ABC News, ""including some augmented reality, where at the finish line, runners will be able to put a medal over their head in a photo.""

Other tools, Burke adds, will allow runners to hear the sounds of the marathon course on race-day, including the sound of the cannon at the start in Staten Island on the Verrazanno Bridge, and crowd noises similar to a normal race.

The marathon can also bring out over 2 million spectators, lining the streets the entire length of the course. ABC's Brad Mielke, host of the Start Here podcast, normally spends Marathon Sunday high-fiving anyone that runs past.

""In the city where you think everyone is isolated and mean and angry and lonely, you've got people who are high-fiving strangers for three hours at a time,"" he says. ""That's like, the magic of it all.""

The NYRR allowed participants to submit their run time anytime within a two-week stretch, beginning on Oct. 17, and ending on the normal race day, Nov. 1.

And while the milestone anniversary celebration will have to wait, Burke says organizers hope to recognize the 50th running of the race next year, the same time as ever, the first Sunday in November.

"Massachusetts' COVID-19 response was science-based, so why are cases rising?","Massachusetts' COVID-19 response was science-based, so why are cases rising? Daily case counts look similar to what the state was experiencing in May.

Massachusetts' initial pandemic response is considered to be among the best in the country.

Residents have been wearing masks and the state has collected COVID-19 data and launched one of the nation's first contact tracing programs. For months, the safety measures seemed to be working, but now, cases are on the rise once again. On Thursday, Massachusetts reported 1,243 new COVID-19 cases, according to the health department, marking the sixth day in a row it logged more than 1,000 single-day cases.

Daily case counts now look similar to what the state was experiencing in mid-May, with a seven-day average for new cases up nearly 339% since early September, according to an ABC analysis of state data.

In addition to rising case counts, 121 communities across Massachusetts are currently considered ""high risk,"" according to the state department of health. Identified communities have an average rate of new cases greater than eight per 100,000 over the past 14 days.

To date, Massachusetts has reported more than 151,740 COVID-19 cases. The state has also had 9,727 deaths, more than 65% of which were in long-term care facilities, according to analysis of data provided by the state health department.

""The only silver lining is that the number of deaths has stayed fairly stable since the springtime,"" said Dr. Howard Koh, a professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

""But we also know that when cases go up, hospitalizations and ultimately deaths generally follow,"" said Koh, the former public health commissioner in Massachusetts during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

""Everyone is watching those indicators carefully,"" he added.

Dr. Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and dean at the Boston University School of Public Health, thinks it's too soon to draw a storyline about what's driving Massachusetts' rebound.

""There's enormous patchiness,"" he said of the state's outbreak, which looks very different in Boston than it does in rural areas in western Massachusetts.

And while there's evidence that people under the age of 30 are driving the rebound in new cases this fall, Galea doesn't think the rise is related to Boston's high density of universities, some of which have opened in person.

""Transmissions are quite low,"" he said of schools.

Instead, he pointed to informal gatherings, especially among young people. ""Whether those can come under control is an open question,"" Galea said. ""It's fluctuating day by day.""

The weather isn't helping either. States across the country have seen rising COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks. ""Drier conditions are creating more transmission,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. ""People are starting to spend more time indoors with the temperature coming down.""

A 'tenacious' virus

What Massachusetts' rising case count doesn't show is that the state took a more proactive COVID-19 response than almost any other place in the country and seemed to have the virus in check throughout the late spring and summer.

That's in part because of the strong public health infrastructure that existed in the state before the pandemic, including a hub of universities and hospitals in Boston. ""This is a state with a strong public health position and a concentration of medical and public health expertise,"" Koh said. ""This is a state that has been science-based in its response. They've been looking at data every day.""

But even in a gold-standard public health environment, stemming COVID-19 without wrecking the economy has proved challenging.

""We're seeing a rise in cases over recent weeks, especially in the last month. This is a tenacious virus,"" Koh said. ""You just cannot be too cautious.""

Disparities on display in Boston and Lawrence, Massachusetts

Boston, Massachusetts' biggest city, has unsurprisingly led the state in COVID-19 infections.

And similar to other cities around the country, those nearly 20,000 cases are concentrated in Black and brown neighborhoods. Although Boston's population is only 25% black and 20% Latino, Black and Latino residents are significantly more likely to be infected with COVID-19 than white residents are, according to city data.

Boston's average positive test rate has risen to 7.8%, Mayor Marty Walsh warned at a Thursday press conference. The uptick was even more pronounced in Dorchester, a majority Black neighborhood in the city, which reported a more than 10% testing positivity rate for the week ending Oct. 24.

""All the neighborhoods that are getting hit hardest are the lower-income neighborhoods, these are places where you have multi-generational households, you have many people who are essential workers, who are the ones having to bear the brunt,"" Brownstein said.

In Lawrence, Massachusetts, an 80,000-person city north of Boston near the New Hampshire border, where most residents are Latino, the 14-day average positive test rate topped 9% on Oct. 28, nearly twice the level that the World Health Organization recommends.

""The pandemic has disproportionately hit communities of color,"" Koh said. ""They have all the social forces that put communities at risk, like being low-income and having multi-generational housing.""

The hard reality of balancing public health and economics

In June, as infections declined, Massachusetts laid off at least 200 members of the state's 1,000-person contact tracing team, an investigation by ABC affiliate WCVB found. In September, as cases ticked upward, the state started hiring contact tracers back.

Koh wishes that the state had kept those people on staff -- permanently.

""I hope contact tracers can be permanent members of revitalized workforce for the future,"" he said. Contact tracing is most effective when tracers are trusted members of their local communities, Koh explained. For some residents, it's also a lifeline. Tracers ensure that people in quarantine and isolation have access to food and medicine through social services and have their basic needs met.

""Their value goes well beyond infectious control,"" Koh said. ""A large part of the suffering we're seeing reflects the fact that we have an under-resourced public health system,"" he said of the United States.

In Galea's opinion, Massachusetts officials have done their best to balance the state's public health and economic needs. He applauded leaders for ramping up contact tracing and for giving the public clear public health messaging about COVID-19.

""If you did a Melbourne-style lockdown, you would probably bring cases down,"" Galea said, noting that at one point last month, Massachusetts had the highest unemployment rate in the country. ""That's really hard,"" he added.

As for places that could be improved, Galea pointed to testing. ""Testing remains hampered by general federal chaos,"" he said. ""It's hard to think of ways Massachusetts could be better in the vacuum, absent a broader federal strategy.""

Reporter's Notebook: How are other countries enduring the pandemic?,"I thought I was hallucinating.

I was sitting outside in the garden of my hotel in Liberia when a man came out to sit at a table across from me.

""Hi, mate,"" he said, in a familiar British voice. It was strange to see another Brit -- let alone a foreigner -- in this small African nation, which, like so many other places during COVID-19, was supposed to be cut off from the rest of the world.

""What you doing here then, mate?"" he asked with a broad Newcastle accent. ""Journalist, are you?""

I told him I was there to film a National Geographic special on viruses and the next pandemic. ""How about you?""

""Ah, well, I work in the mines,"" he said. ""But I've been stuck here since February. I had gone to see my girlfriend in Thailand, and when I came back they put me straight into quarantine because they thought I'd been in China.""

My eyes must have widened because he could tell I was trying to imagine the idea being quarantined in Liberia.

""Yeah,"" he said, laughing. ""It wasn't great.""

It was astonishing to me that one of the poorest countries in the world had managed to set up a system of this kind, while more developed nations are still struggling to establish widespread testing procedures.

Kevin, who didn't share his last name, said he'd spent two weeks in what was essentially a Liberian military prison. He had a small cell, with a mattress on the floor, and a sponge and bowl in the corner. He said he had to share a toilet and shower with 24 other people.

""If I didn't have coronavirus when I went in,"" he joked, ""I definitely had it when I got out.""

But Liberia's attitude toward the novel coronavirus is certainly no joke. It's one of a series of countries I've visited during the pandemic, and given its experience battling Ebola and knowledge of public health risks, its coronavirus strategy was one of the strictest. You are only permitted to fly there with proof of a negative test taken within 72 hours. Once off the plane in Monrovia, passengers are shuttled toward large sinks to wash their hands and made to fill out all their contact details by airport staff who are wearing full-body protective gear. But what's more, travelers can only leave the country once they've had another test -- so you can understand my panic upon hearing Kevin's story.

The rather uncomfortable nose-and-throat swab is taken at an empty football stadium in the capital, where, again, a surprisingly efficient process gives you a result within 24 hours. It was astonishing to me that one of the poorest countries in the world had managed to set up a system of this kind, while more developed nations are still struggling to establish widespread testing procedures. There is still much to learn about the dangers of coronavirus -- who gets sick and why -- but with around 1,400 confirmed cases and just 82 deaths, Liberia is certainly doing something right.

Greece also saw perhaps unexpected success early on, although like the rest of Europe is now experiencing a second wave. But testing at the border seems to have kept the country clear of the major catastrophes that hit its neighbors. We arrived in Athens in mid-May -- again, with special permission -- to find testing booths set up in the arrivals hall. Greece had closed its borders to everyone except Greek residents at a relatively early stage of the pandemic and so was able to keep arrival numbers small enough to not only give everyone a test but also put them up in specially designated hotels for 24 hours until receiving their results. An additional two weeks of mandatory quarantine at home was enforced -- and by and large respected by a population keen to protect its elderly citizens. Any traveler with a positive result remained in isolation at the hotel, where they had to stay until testing negative. Our 24 hours waiting for results in Athens was a little stressful, but a hotel in Greece might be a better way to spend two weeks than a prison in Liberia.

When I spoke with the culture minister and her team about what restrictions Britain had introduced on travel, they were more than a little surprised to find out that by the same stage nothing was in place in the U.K. Indeed, when I returned from Brazil a few weeks later -- one of the worst-affected countries on Earth, and at the time at the peak of its pandemic -- anyone with a European passport was able to use the automatic gates at the airport, with not a single question asked about where they'd been.

Turkey's procedures seemed a little less clear. Arriving in the country was not dependent on any kind of test, but there was a testing system at the airport for travelers requiring one. Before checking in, we were directed to a series of desks at the far end of the departures terminal that required registration and payment, before a man in full PPE greeted us in what looked like a futuristic port-a-potty to take a rather intrusive nose-and-mouth swab. Of all my virus tests, this was the most uncomfortable. Results were emailed -- a smart-looking PDF -- directly to each of the team within about 12 hours.

In October, I travelled to Italy, France and Belgium and found that testing procedures seemed more widely available. European citizens are used to far cheaper health care than are Americans, so paying even a comparatively small fee for a test in a Paris suburb did seem odd to me. But at €130 (about $150) it's a far more reasonable price now than earlier in the pandemic.

Of the seven tests I've done, three were in the U.K., after returning from abroad. They weren't required by the authorities, or even available under Britain's National Health Service, but private tests carried out for our own piece of mind. One of these was an at-home test, which even at a private clinic took five days to process, with the other two performed on the premises.

Even after all these tests, including an antibody test that showed I've never had the virus, I'm still not totally convinced I've managed to go COVID-free free for so long. I was in Italy four times at the beginning of the crisis -- well before we knew coronavirus had likely already spread across Europe. I've been to 11 countries since March, each time connecting at least once through another country. On each trip we are very careful -- masks on at most times, with hand-washing and social distancing now just a part of our work. But still, in the back of my mind, I think about false negatives and all the other issues we still know so little about when it comes to this virus.

Of the countries I've visited, it seems to me that early testing kept the virus out. In places where that wasn't happening, it's been an uphill struggle. The second part of the equation -- tracing -- seems to be the missing piece of the puzzle now. Countries know who has the virus, but the technology to track them and make sure they stay home seems to have alluded them -- at least so far.",,
"49 states, territories seeing upward trajectory of new COVID-19 cases: HHS","49 states, territories seeing upward trajectory of new COVID-19 cases: HHS Only three areas are at a plateau and three areas are reporting a case decrease.

Forty-nine states and territories are in an upward trajectory of new COVID-19 cases, according to an internal Health and Human Services memo obtained by ABC News.

Only three jurisdictions are at a plateau. Just three areas are reporting a case decrease.

The U.S. recorded 537,501 new coronavirus cases during the week ending Oct. 29 -- a 25.4% increase from the previous week, the memo said.

Deaths are up by 2.2% compared with the previous week.

The national test-positivity rate has increased from 6.1% to 6.3% in week-to-week comparisons, according to the HHS memo.

In Indiana, the hospitalization rate reached its highest point this week since April, the memo said.

Indiana hospitals are managing the patient surge but are concerned about adequate staffing, according to the memo.

In New Jersey, COVID-19 hospitalizations surpassed 1,000 patients this week for the first time since July, the HHS reported.

New cases doubled from one week to the next in neighboring counties Hunterdon (36 to 72 cases) and Warren (27 to 55 cases), the memo said.

In Rhode Island, officials reported a 65.5% week-to-week increase in new cases, the memo said.

Rhode Island saw a record-high hospitalization rate this week -- the highest in the last six months. Rhode Island had over 80 new COVID-19 hospital admissions during the week ending Oct. 25 -- nearly double the number of admissions from the previous week.

In Vermont, new cases have increased by 124.3% compared to the previous week.

Wisconsin reported twice as many new cases for the week ending Oct. 25 versus the week prior, the memo said.

In West Virginia, hospitalizations reached a four-month peak on Oct. 25, according to HHS.

Nearly one-third of West Virginia's COVID-19 patients were in the intensive care unit during the week ending Oct. 25, marking the highest percentage of COVID-19 patients in critical care in the region.",,
"Europe struggling with 2nd surge of COVID-19 case, and it may be worse than the 1st","Europe struggling with 2nd surge of COVID-19 case, and it may be worse than the 1st The continent now accounts for 46% of global coronavirus cases.

Europe is now battling a second surge of COVID-19 cases, and many worry it could be worse than the first.

The continent now accounts for 46% of global coronavirus cases, and nearly a third of total related deaths. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments.

In France, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Dr. Jean-Francois Delfraissy, a senior French physician and the president of the scientific council that reports to the government, warned that the country has ""lost control of the epidemic,"" after health authorities reported more than 52,000 new cases. He said that the council estimates that the true figure could well be closer to 100,000 daily cases, accounting for asymptomatic cases and those who haven't been tested.

While European countries are testing citizens for the virus at a faster rate than during the first wave, in the spring, there are other trends that may explain why the virus has returned with a vengeance.

Research from King's College London and Imperial College London indicates that antibodies protecting people against COVID-19 have a limited presence in the body after infection -- a theory that has thrown arguments in favor of herd immunity into disarray.

Many European countries are global tourist destinations, and in the summer, after several months of nearly universal lockdown across borders, governments relaxed travel restrictions. This allowed families and tourists to travel -- both domestically and to nearby countries -- after spending several months at home.

But young people in Europe were blamed for spreading the virus as nations eased lockdown measures. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported that the median age of people infected declined from 54 during the period of January to May, down to 39 in June and July.

In September, fresh concerns were raised as schools and universities accounted for almost a third of new coronavirus cases, according to Public Health France.

But now, in late October, the virus is also spreading fast among the elderly. The number of infections among those older than 65 is now six times as high as in September, and there are five times as many hospitalizations, according to Public Health France.

Fearing both the economic price of national lockdowns and the political backlash from citizens increasingly wearied of the restrictions on their livelihoods, government officials around Europe have been reluctant to shutter businesses to the extent that they did in the spring.

Italy, originally the hardest-hit country in Europe, is now recording around 20,000 cases a day and a rate of deaths not seen since May. A string of violent protests -- aimed to communicate people's objection to the government's potential tightening of restrictions -- erupted across the country over the weekend.

New measures enacted include the closing of bars and restaurants after 6 p.m., and the complete closure of gyms, swimming pools, cinemas and theaters.

As the second surge of COVID-19 cases gathers pace, there are also mounting concerns over the pressure European hospitals will face -- as the resurgence of the virus has arrived around the same time as the annual flu season.

Health journal The Lancet last week argued that, in general, countries are ""much better prepared"" now than when COVID-19 first hit.

""But October also marks the beginning of the flu season in the northern hemisphere,"" the report read. ""If both viruses surge simultaneously, even the best resourced health-care systems would be hard pressed to cope.""

Still, a silver lining appears to be that the rate of deaths in Europe is not as high as it was during the first wave of the pandemic. Earlier this month, Hans Kluge of the World Health Organization said that while the situation in Europe is of ""great concern,"" the morbidity rate has had a less dramatic curve than earlier in the spring.

But a seasonal crisis may be looming.

The Lancet warned that while lockdowns and social distancing measures would invariably impact the rate of flu and coronavirus transmissions, countries like the U.K., where the National Health Service is feared to be on the verge of a breaking point, COVID-19 cases could hit a record peak in the winter.

Watching Europe's second wave roll in from a French ICU: Reporters Notebook,"Lyon, France -- I've seen the impact COVID has had in countries all over the world. But this was the first time I was able to go into an intensive care unit and see for myself those clinging to life.

Eight months into this pandemic, it's easy to forget that people are still getting very sick. In Lyon, at the Centre Hospitalier Saint-Joseph et Saint-Luc in France, the ICU recently hits 65% of capacity with COVID cases and has had to release more beds. Non-emergency surgery has been suspended yet again.

As with the rest of the world, surging COVID cases here are primarily among the young -- France had 52,000 in one day on Oct. 26. They are seeing what the rest of Europe fears: cases turning into hospital admissions, and then deaths.

The virus is moving once again from the young to the elderly and, as with other European countries, deaths are climbing.

In room after room, we saw patients on ventilators, wires and tubes linked up to machines keeping them alive. We saw one lady having a coughing fit -- her hands bouncing on her chest as she gasped for air. One difference this time around seems to be patient ages: those admitted to this hospital are older than they were in the spring, with more serious existing conditions.

Cardiologist Dr. Lisa Green told me they are preparing as best they can for what may be coming down the line. ""We don't know; we can't predict what the second wave is going to be like. We don't know how long it's going to be; how intense it's going to be. We're at the beginning, really, of the curve, but definitely it's an ascending curve.""

A worrying time -- but they've also learned some valuable lessons and have changed how patients are treated, meaning a far better success rate.

Green explained the difference in organization this time around.

""We've got a specific medical COVID ward, but we've also opened small sectors in specialty departments,"" said Green. ""For example, I work in the cardiology department, and we've opened two beds for COVID patients that come in with a primary cardiological pathology as well as a positive PCR. So instead of these patients going into the medical COVID wards, they come into the cardiology department and they have better care management.""

New quick tests also help -- they allow for a result in 20 minutes rather than 48 hours, meaning patients are treated much more quickly than they were in the spring. We also saw much less PPE in the ICU -- the head of the unit told us they know more about how the virus is transmitted and it means his staff aren't wasting valuable time with repeated changes and becoming exhausted with restricted breathing. And, of course, those all-important steroids that improve care immeasurably are being used here to great effect.

The debate about whether further lockdowns are necessary continues to rage -- a ""tide"" may be more manageable for health services than a ""wave"" -- but this hospital is preparing itself for the long haul.

Above all, says Green, the virus has not changed -- these doctors may know more about it, but it is still as serious as ever. In a year like no other, this virus may yet have more surprises.",,
Pandemic reinvents holiday hiring for retailers,"Pandemic reinvents holiday hiring for retailers The push to hire temporary workers has begun in earnest this holiday season, in some cases weeks earlier than last year

NEW YORK -- Wanted this holiday shopping season: Cart sanitizers, curbside delivery workers and mask enforcers.

The push to hire temporary workers has begun in earnest this holiday season — in some cases, weeks earlier than last year. But the pandemic has reshaped the kinds of jobs retailers are recruiting for.

As more shoppers shy away from stores and shift their purchases online during the pandemic, retailers have stepped up the pace of hiring at warehouses. At the same time, they are looking for workers who can handle new tasks like checking temperatures and booking store appointments for shoppers who still want the in-store experience but are jittery about exposure to the coronavirus.

Signet Jewelers, which operates Zales and Jared, is hiring concierges who book store appointments, handle crowds and help out with curbside pickup at its stores during the holiday season. It began its recruiting efforts late summer instead of early fall.

“We needed an early start because of the uniqueness of the environment,” said Bill Luth, executive vice president of Signet, which plans to hire 4,000 holiday workers, similar to last year.

Andrew Challenger, vice president of global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, expects the number of holiday jobs will be lower than the 702,000 jobs added in 2019, as store closings offset the surging demand for warehouse workers. More than 40 retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this year, including more than two dozen retailers since the coronavirus outbreak.

Retail store jobs were down 13% the week ending Oct. 13 compared to the week of March 1 before the pandemic hit, according to Snagajob, which recruits for with major retailers. Postings for e-commerce warehouse jobs, however, were up nearly fourfold.

Some big box stores and warehouses may nonetheless end up hiring fewer seasonal workers because they already added hundreds of thousands of workers in March and April to meet a sudden surge online ordering when the pandemic began.

Amazon said it plans to hire 100,000 people for the holidays, half the amount it hired last year. But the retailer has increased hiring throughout the year, adding 175,000 people in March and another 100,000 in September.

Target said it expects to hire more than 100,000 people for the holiday season, about the same as last year. Store workers may also be doing double duty. Someone tasked with folding shirts, for example, may be asked to bring items to shoppers in the parking lot for curbside pickup.

Walmart is hiring more than 20,000 seasonal associates at its e-commerce fulfillment centers. That's higher than last holiday season, though the company declined to give a figure. Walmart has already hired more than 500,000 workers in stores and across its distribution centers since March.

Filling some of these temporary holiday jobs, however, may not be easy, even in the face of a high unemployment rate brought on by the pandemic. Like shoppers, many workers are nervous about the spread of coronavirus and the thought of being in a packed warehouse or a crowded store holds little appeal despite the paycheck.

Liisa Luick, a 13-year veteran at a Macy’s store in the Seattle, Washington area, says she won’t be working extra holiday hours as she did in years past — even as her hours were cut after COVID-19 to 31 hours a week from 43. The 53-year-old said she’s worried about getting exposed to the virus and she also believes the tensions among shoppers will be higher.

“I told them don’t count on me,” said Luick who works in the men’s clothing department. “The extra money would be nice, but it’s not worth the risk.”

Radial, which fills online orders for brands including Payless and Cole Haan, plans to hire more than 25,000 seasonal workers at its 26 fulfillment centers, 40% more than last year. Ilias Simpson, Radial’s senior vice president of fulfillment, said it has received many applications from people laid off from restaurants and other hard-hit sectors.

Still, he said virus exposure fears and extra federal unemployment benefits early in the pandemic made some people reluctant to take on warehouse jobs.

“There are definitely some challenges this year,” Simpson said.

Safety protocols are key this year to attracting workers, he said. The company has invested in technological solutions, including badges that alert workers if they are less than six feet from someone else. Radial has also installed thermal imaging kiosks that screen for fevers and provide reminders to wear masks. It has about 200 robots to help with the picking and packing, intended to help with social distancing.

Other companies have used bonuses and pay increases to attract workers, expecting the competition to be stiff in some cities.

In September, Walmart raised its minimum hourly pay to $15 from $11 for certain store jobs. Target has raised in minimum hourly wage to $15 and just announced it would be giving $200 bonuses to workers, including seasonal hires — the fourth time it shelled out bonuses to workers this year. Amazon, where starting pay is $15 an hour, is offering sign-on bonuses of $1,000 for new hires.

Call center jobs have been in high demand because many of them allow people to work from home, a prospect that is particularly appealing to working mothers, according to Greg Hanover, CEO of LiveOps, a virtual call center based in Scottsdale, Arizona, that works with fashion companies and department stores.

LiveOps is getting 5,000 applicants a week, compared to 1,700 a year ago. The company is hiring up to 3,000 seasonal workers, double the number it brought on last year, Hanover said.

“We are not seeing any challenges in any region,"" he said. “They like the idea of working from the safety of the home.”

England to enter new lockdown; UK virus cases pass 1 million,"England to enter new lockdown; UK virus cases pass 1 million British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that the government is putting all of England under a monthlong lockdown next week after being warned that a resurgent coronavirus outbreak will overwhelm hospitals in weeks without tough action

LONDON -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday announced a new month-long lockdown for England after being warned that without tough action a resurgent coronavirus outbreak will overwhelm hospitals in weeks.

On the day the U.K. passed 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, Johnson made a sudden about-face and confirmed that stringent restrictions on business and daily life would begin Thursday and last until Dec. 2.

He said at a televised news conference that “no responsible prime minister” could ignore the grim figures.

“Unless we act, we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day,” said Johnson, who was hospitalized earlier this year for a serious case of COVID-19.

Under the new restrictions, bars and restaurants can only offer take-out, non-essential shops must close and people will only be able to leave home for a short list of reasons including exercise. Activities ranging from haircuts to foreign holidays must once again be put on hold.

Unlike during the U.K.’s first three-month lockdown earlier this year, schools, universities, construction sites and manufacturing businesses will stay open.

As in other European countries, virus cases in the U.K. began to climb after lockdown measures were eased in the summer and people began to return to workplaces, schools, universities and social life. The Office for National Statistics estimated Friday that 1 in 100 people in England, well over half a million, had the virus in the week to Oct. 23.

Johnson had hoped a set of regional restrictions introduced earlier in October would be enough to push numbers down. But government scientific advisers predict that on the outbreak’s current trajectory, demand for hospital beds will exceed capacity by the first week of December, even if temporary hospitals set up during the first peak of the virus are reopened.

The scientists warned COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths could soon surpass the levels seen at the outbreak’s spring peak, when daily deaths topped 1,000. The government's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said the mortality rate had “potential to be twice as bad, if not more” than it was during the pandemic's first European wave, if nothing was done.

As European countries such as France, Germany and Belgium in imposing a second lockdown amid surging caseloads, it looked inevitable that Johnson would have to follow.

Official figures announced Saturday recorded 21,915 new cases confirmed in the last 24 hours, bringing Britain’s total since the start of the pandemic to 1,011,660. Britain’s death toll from the coronavirus is 46,555, the highest in Europe, with 326 new deaths announced Saturday.

The United States, India, Brazil, Russia, France, Spain, Argentina and Colombia have also recorded more than 1 million cases, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Scientists say the true number of cases is much higher because not everyone with the virus is tested.

Any new lockdown will need Parliament’s approval, and a vote is scheduled for Wednesday. The new restrictions would apply to England. Other parts of the U.K. set their own public health measures, with Wales and Northern Ireland already effectively in lockdown and Scotland under a set of tough regional restrictions.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Saturday that for now people in Scotland should not travel to or from England, “except for essential purposes.”

Throughout the pandemic, many British scientists and public health experts have accused Johnson of being too slow to act. London School of Hygiene epidemiologist John Edmunds, a member of the government’s scientific advisory group, said that even with the new lockdown, Britain was facing ""deaths in tens of thousands from this wave.”

Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, said in response to the lockdown announcement, ""There’s no denying these measures are necessary and I’m glad that the government has finally taken the decision that it should have taken weeks ago.”

But Johnson is under pressure from some members of his Conservative Party, who oppose tighter restrictions because of the economic damage they cause.

Owners of businesses that have struggled to get back on their feet since the first lockdown was eased said the impact of new closures would be devastating.

“People have borrowed up to the hilt and spent money in order to get COVID-secure,” said Kate Nicholls of pub and restaurant industry group Hospitality U.K. “There is no spare capacity in the tank to be able to fund a lockdown, even for three to four weeks.”

A government program that has paid the wages of millions of furloughed employees during the pandemic was due to end Saturday, but will be extended during the new lockdown.

Johnson had planned to announce the lockdown in Parliament on Monday, but was forced into early action after the Times of London reported the news. The government said there would be an investigation into the leak.

Johnson said the government had to make “incredibly difficult” judgments during the pandemic. He said it was “a constant struggle and a balance that any government has to make between lives and livelihoods -- and obviously lives must come first.”

England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said at the news conference that “there is basically no perfect time (to act), and there are no good solutions.”

“We’re trying to have the least bad set of solutions,” he said.

Thousands mourn death of Montenegro bishop amid virus fears,"Thousands mourn death of Montenegro bishop amid virus fears Thousands of people have poured into the streets in Montenegro despite soaring coronavirus infections to mourn the death of the top Serbian Orthodox Church bishop in the country

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Thousands of people on Saturday poured into the streets in Montenegro despite soaring coronavirus infections to mourn the death of the top Serbian Orthodox Church bishop in the country.

Huge crowds gathered around the main church in the capital, Podgorica, where the body of Bishop Amfilohije was brought in an open casket ahead of the funeral on Sunday. The mourners lined up to pass by the coffin and pay respects.

The 82-year old Bishop Amfilohije died on Friday in a hospital after contracting the coronavirus weeks ago. Yet, the crowds outside the church did not keep anti-virus distance and not all were wearing face masks.

Along with much of the Balkans and central and eastern Europe, Montenegro has seen a surge in infections. Health authorities have warned mourners to respect anti-virus rules.

Bishop Amfilohije was highly popular among pro-Serb Montenegrins who have been seeking closer ties with neighboring Serbia following Montenegro's split from a joint state in 2006. The Serbian Orthodox Church remains the main church in the country.

The bishop played a key role in a movement that helped defeat in the August election a long-ruling pro-Western government. The church in Montenegro also has led months of protests this year against a religious property law, arguing that the government wants to take away its property, which officials have denied.

Montenegro's outgoing leadership led the country to independence from Serbia and into NATO in 2017, defying Russia. Bishop Amfilohije and the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro were against independence from Serbia, Moscow's main Balkan ally.",,
Food manufacturers increase production to avoid grocery shortages on in-demand products,"Food manufacturers increase production to avoid grocery shortages on in-demand products The demand for pantry items has started to resurge ahead of the holidays.

As the U.S. has seen a rise in coronavirus cases, food producers and grocery stores are working to stay ahead of shoppers' needs.

Many manufacturers that were caught off guard by the crush of demand during the initial COVID-19 outbreak have upped production in hopes of avoiding any potential shortages.

General Mills has added 45 external production lines to boost its manufacturing, and Campbell Soup spent $40 million to produce more of its Goldfish crackers and chip products.

Experts said that this time around, empty shelves might be different than the ones that were bare last time.

Centricity, a company that tracks online searches and e-commerce, found that the demand for baking goods is up 3,400% from this same time last year, as well as searches for spices.

Mike Brackett told “Good Morning America” that those are key ingredients for homemade meals that may be helpful for first-time cooks.

“A lot of millennials perhaps hadn't done a lot of cooking before because they hadn't had to,” Brackett said, adding that shoppers are searching for “spices, feel-good items [and] slow cooker-type of items.”

His company has also seen spikes in searches for items that can be prepared early ahead of the upcoming holidays so that they can avoid potentially crowded stores on the big day.

“Whatever can be frozen or whatever is non-perishable that you can safely keep into the holidays. We're seeing a lot of that,” he said.

Stew Leonard, the CEO of his namesake Northeast grocery store chain, told “GMA” they his stores recently “noticed an uptick” in customers stocking up on products.

“You're seeing huge spikes in tuna fish,” Leonard said. “Pizzas are huge. The pizza dough is really big. All the comfort foods.”

When the pandemic first hit, Leonard said many suppliers weren’t ready for increased operation, but this time he is confident that he’s prepared for the months ahead and has bulked up on stock.

“We've checked with all our suppliers. They've assured us that all these shelves in here will be full,” Leonard said.

“I have a new appreciation for toilet paper during this,” he said of the product that flew from shelves early on. “We're not going to be caught flat-footed on this one again.”",,
"Predictions of more suicides, overdoses and domestic abuse during COVID are coming true","Predictions of more suicides, overdoses and domestic abuse during COVID are coming true Isolation, economic pressure and family conflict all are major contributors.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the stay-at-home measures and disruptions to daily life that aimed to slow the spread of the virus and save lives led many public health specialists to worry that the nation also could see an uptick in suicides, drug overdoses and domestic violence.

Nine months later, those grim predictions look like they're coming true.

""There is a mental health wave to this pandemic,"" Dr. Ken Duckworth, chief medical officer of the National Alliance for Mental Illness, told ABC News. ""We as a species don't do well with uncertainty.""

The pandemic, for many Americans, has exacerbated already-stressful scenarios -- deaths of loved ones, illnesses, loss of income -- according to psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe.

Additionally, stay-at-home orders and school closures -- important actions to prevent virus spread -- created downstream consequences such as social isolation, eroding support networks and additional financial strain.

All of these factors are contributing to more suicides, overdoses and violence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And specialists warn that this mental health pandemic within the virus pandemic also will disproportionately affect Blacks, Hispanics, the elderly, people of lower socioeconomic status of all races, and health care workers.

Many of these accelerating public health crises already were worsening before COVID-19.

In 2018, the U.S had the highest age-adjusted suicide rates since 1941. By June, a CDC survey of 5,470 US adults found that one-third reported anxiety or depression symptoms. About 10% said they had considered suicide during the last month, and the rate of suicidal thoughts was highest among unpaid caregivers, essential workers, Hispanic or Black respondents and young adults.

People age 18 to 25 may be the most affected group, Duckworth explained.

""We need to take a look at the age impact,"" Duckworth added. ""In the age where identity is developed, young adults are missing college.""

The opioid epidemic, previously considered the greatest public health threat in the U.S., also has worsened since the virus outbreak. After overdose deaths briefly plateaued in 2017 -- stricter regulations of prescription drugs were enacted -- deaths began creeping upward again because of illegal synthetic substitutes like fentanyl.

""We were making some improvement in terms of treatment options for opioid addiction prior to the pandemic,"" Dr. Harshal Kirane, medical director of Wellbridge Addiction Treatment and Research, told ABC news. ""However, there were still major treatment gaps that have worsened now that we have a superimposed pandemic.""

More than 40 states have reported increases in opioid-related deaths since then pandemic struck, according to the American Medical Association.

Overdoses -- both fatal and non-fatal -- have increased 20% compared with the same time period in 2019, according to the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program.

""The incidence of first-time users is also on the rise,"" Kirane added. ""Isolation, economic pressure and family conflict during quarantine are all factors for this.""

Reports of domestic violence are also are rising, with many experts worried the cases reported are but a small fraction of those happening. Just in New York City, ""there has been a substantial increase in calls to the domestic violence hotline,"" said Kelli Owens, executive director of the New York State Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence.

""The calls to the hotlines dropped in the first few weeks of the pandemic, increased by 30% in April, and increased by 76% by August. They have remained elevated into September,"" she added.

The United Nations warns that the pandemic is likely to undermine efforts to end gender-based violence globally, while stay-at-home and social distancing orders may effectively trap the abused with their abusers.

The CDC recognized that violence is a serious public health problem. It affects people in all stages of life, and many of violence survivors suffer from long-term physical, mental and emotional health problems.

""It is important to keep in mind the domestic violence is usually under-reported,"" Owen added.

Public health specialists and policy makers are taking steps to try to address these alarming trends. For example, many states have eased restrictions for telehealth, making it easier to access a medical provider during a crisis. Some are making it easier to prescribe medication for opioid-use disorder without an in-person visit.

Over the summer, the CDC released guidance for people experiencing abuse and for those coping with extreme stress during the pandemic. The CDC recommends making a plan if you live in an unsafe home, practicing self-care as much as possible and trying to maintain virtual social connections with people outside your immediate home.

Community-level solutions should prioritize young adults, racial and ethnic minorities, essential workers and adult caregivers, according to the CDC, which said these efforts should include economic support, efforts to reduce stresses related to racial discrimination, promoting community social connections and care for those at risk of suicide.

""This pandemic isn't going anywhere,"" Duckworth said. ""My advice is: Lower expectations, stay connected with people, reach out for professional help when needed, don't skip your flu shot and remain physically active.""

If you or a loved one is experiencing suicidal thoughts, The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline provides 24/7, free and confidential support. Call 1-800-273-8255 for help.

This is how bats survive deadly viruses better than humans,"This is how bats survive deadly viruses better than humans The animals' immune systems evolved to tamp down inflammation.

This is an Inside Science story.

Bats can harbor many viruses that are potentially deadly to humans, including those behind SARS, Ebola and possibly SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Now scientists have identified key ways in which bats can harbor these dangerous germs while apparently suffering no ill effects from them, which may reveal ways to deal with these contagions in humans.

Roughly 75% of the emerging infectious diseases humans face are zoonotic, or come from animals, according to the EcoHealth Alliance, an environmental health nonprofit group in New York. In the past 20 years, researchers have discovered that bats host some of the most lethal emerging infectious diseases -- including those behind maladies such as Nipah, Hendra, Marburg and MERS -- yet the animals only rarely display clinical symptoms from such contagions.

""When we look at bats in Southeast Asian caves, we find 5% to 10% of them are infected with coronaviruses. That's incredibly high,"" said disease ecologist Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance. ""If you look at birds and West Nile virus, 1 in 1,000 are infected during peak season. It seems certain that bats as a group can survive a high burden of coronaviruses and other infections. Why is that?""

One clue to this mystery was revealed in 2016 when virologist Lin-Fa Wang at Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School and his colleagues discovered that all known bat genomes completely lost the genes encoding molecules known as AIM2-like receptors. In humans, these immune proteins detect the DNA of hostile germs within cells and can trigger a cascade of events leading to inflammation and cell death.

In the new study, Wang and his colleagues introduced the genes for human AIM2-like receptors into bat kidney and immune cells grown in lab dishes. This resulted in a clustering of proteins in the cells that usually mark the onset of inflammation.

However, installing AIM2-like receptors in bat cells did not restore other known inflammatory responses, such as activation of the enzyme caspase-1, which plays a central role in mobilizing immune defenses. In black fruit bats (Pteropus alecto), the scientists found that caspase-1 possessed alterations that likely blunted its activity.

The researchers also discovered that in black fruit bats, the cave nectar bat (Eonycteris spelaea), and the vesper bat David's myotis (Myotis davidii), a protein called interleukin 1 beta that is activated by caspase-1 in humans possessed modifications that made it less active in response to greater caspase-1 activity.

All in all, these new findings revealed bats evolved strategies to tamp down their inflammatory responses at multiple levels, some of which might have evolved independently several times. This in turn likely helps bats tolerate potentially lethal viruses. Although the absence of AIM2-like receptors might prove dangerous in some as-yet-unknown way to bats, presumably such a risk is more than offset by avoiding the harm from an overactive immune response to germs, Wang noted.

Why might bats suppress inflammation? As the only flying mammal, bats are under constant metabolic stresses that land mammals do not endure, Wang said. ""Imagine doing a 100-yard dash every night all night long, or imagine lifting your body weight -- 150 pounds, 200 pounds -- into the air all night long,"" said Daszak, who did not take part in this research. ""That huge amount of stress creates breakdown products, a normal inflammatory response to which would not be sustainable.""

Suppressing inflammation might explain not only how bats can safely harbor lethal viruses, but also why they live unusually long. ""Small mammals like rodents usually only live 12 to 15 months even if they are not eaten by predators, but some bats of the same size live 40 to 50 years,"" Daszak said. ""Maybe dampening of the inflammation response in bats impacts their longevity.""

Over-inflammation plays an important role in many human diseases, ""especially those associated with aged patients,"" Wang said. ""If we can learn the lessons from bats and apply some of them to human clinical interventions, it will be definitely novel and they will hopefully have less side effects."" For instance, ""dampening inflammation can be one of the strategies to avoid severe disease in COVID-19 patients,"" he added.

These findings should not lead to knee-jerk efforts to eradicate bats, Wang cautioned. ""Culling bats will have a devastating effect on our ecosystem, which can actually lead to more disease outbreaks,"" he said. ""Bats plays a key role in controlling mosquitos and other insects, which are vectors of many important pathogens.""

Instead, to minimize risk of zoonotic diseases from bats, ""there are very simple low-tech solutions we could adopt, like reducing the wildlife trade, and reducing contact with bat colonies by not cutting down forests,"" Daszak said.

The scientists detailed their findings online Oct. 26 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Latina women face unemployment challenges amid COVID-19,"Latina women face unemployment challenges amid COVID-19 The unemployment rate jumped from 5.5% to 20.5% between February and April 2020.

This report is part of ""Turning Point,"" a groundbreaking series by ABC News examining the racial reckoning sweeping the United States and exploring whether it can lead to lasting reconciliation.

Sandra, a 28-year-old mother of two, spends her mornings taking care of her children and supporting their at-home learning. Their school district provided computers for remote learning as the COVID-19 pandemic made in-person schooling a health risk for students and families alike.

But that's not the only change Sandra's family has faced in recent months. Both she and her husband, a former house painter, unexpectedly lost their jobs.

“We both lost our source of income,” said Sandra, who asked to be identified by only her first name. “[The job loss] has affected us emotionally, I’m stressed, we can’t sleep.”

She also searches for new employment opportunities and works part-time cleaning homes when she can book a gig. The calls, however, are scarce.

“It’s hard to work part-time because [my kids] need assistance,” said Sandra. “I have to sit with them and help them with online classes.”

Sandra, a native of Guatemala, said she immigrated to the U.S. in the hopes of providing a better life for her loved ones. Escaping violence and a lack of economic opportunity, she created a new home in Portland, Oregon.

“I was working in housekeeping in a hotel as my first job,” said Sandra. “After, I went to work in a barbecue restaurant part-time … [the customers] spoke English and I was afraid because I didn’t speak the language, so I couldn't respond to them.”

The language barrier was difficult to overcome. Ultimately she sought other employment opportunities and within months Sandra landed a new job cleaning office buildings. The hours, however, were long.

A few years later, Sandra became a housekeeper providing cleaning services to a regular list of clients, which provided better pay and more flexible hours to care for her children.

But when COVID-19 struck, she could no longer work in those homes.

Now, the drastic loss in household income has made it difficult for her family to make ends meet.

Latina unemployment rates spike amid COVID-19

Like Sandra's, many Hispanic families are facing a financial crisis with lost jobs and wages due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The unemployment rate rose sharply for Hispanic workers, particularly among Hispanic women, amid COVID-19, according to a study released by the Pew Research Center in August. It found that the unemployment rate for Hispanics increased from 4.8% in February to a peak of 18.5% in April before dropping to 14.5% in June.

Pew Research data show that Hispanic women have experienced an especially steep rise in unemployment, jumping from 5.5% to 20.5% between February and April 2020. By comparison, the unemployment rate for Hispanic men rose from 4.3% to 16.9% during this time.

“Given the current economic conditions, there is a lot of contraction of the economy,” said Luisa Blanco, an economist and professor at Pepperdine University’s School of Public Policy. “Latino women are more likely to have more children than other racial ethnic groups. The need to provide child care has grown ... and they don't have another alternative.”

According to Marie Mora, an economist and provost at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, ""Hispanics on average earn less than non-Hispanic whites.”

She added that Hispanic women may not have the financial resources to hire child care, another barrier to finding work.

Additionally, certain industries were impacted by the pandemic more heavily than others. According to the Pew Research study, Hispanic women are more likely to be employed in leisure and hospitality services, which took a major hit from COVID-19.

“During all the shutdowns those industries were disproportionately represented,” said Mora. “The workers that are represented in those types of jobs also took a significant hit.”

“In 2020, everything changed”

The sudden job loss and economic hardship has upended the lives of Latina women across the U.S. and across all professions.

Maria Luisa Gallegos, a single mother of a 13-year-old daughter, had a thriving business as a music promoter and booking manager before the coronavirus outbreak.

“My job was very successful,” said Gallegos. “But in 2020, everything changed.”

Based in Houston, Gallegos had worked in the music industry for 23 years, but due to restrictions, concert venues closed their doors. Gallegos' clients were barely able to perform and she lost her main source of income.

“All the concert roadshows and everything about the music stopped completely,” said Gallegos. “I don’t have any income from the outside.”

During the first few months of the pandemic, she had to rely on assistance and the help of nonprofit organizations. Guillermo De La Rosa, a board member of Living Hope Wheelchair Association, helped her make ends meet by providing food, resources and contacts for hiring companies.

“Usually, I’m trying to be the person that can help somebody else,"" Gallegos said. ""But now, I’m on the other side … I have to get the help from somebody else, that’s very hard.”

Gallegos continues to search for new gigs in different states for one of her long-term clients, Banda Los Costeños, a Houston-based band.

“These concerts are far away from Texas,” Gallegos said. “Yesterday, I flew to Baltimore, Maryland, and I [drove] two-and-a-half hours to work in Manassas, Virginia. We finished the concert around 2:30 a.m. [and] we have to wake up at 6 a.m. and drive seven-and-a-half hours to North Carolina.”

She said obtaining permits for performance venues has become increasingly difficult and ticket sales are down -- as much as 15% of a normal show.

“Usually ... [I’m] trying to be prepared, but this case was very different,” added Gallegos.

“Will the jobs ever come back?”

Employment rates for Hispanic women could be affected in the future and Latina women are being forced to consider changing industries.

Monica Garcia-Perez, an economist and professor at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, said switching jobs presents a unique set of challenges as it places the financial burden on workers to pay for training and learning a new skill set while trying to find new employment opportunities.

These barriers are preventing many Latina workers from “breaking the mold and mov[ing] to other sectors,” said Garcia-Perez.

“Latinas that were laid off are typically front-line staff with hourly jobs without benefits like sick time-off or medical insurance,” said Patricia Mota, president and CEO of the Hispanic Alliance for Career Enhancement (HACE). “They are the first to be unemployed as [Latina women] are seen more as temporary and gig workers. They’ll likely be the last ones hired once the economy improves.”

Mota said training and development programs that teach new skill sets could help these women.

“A national concerted effort needs to be done to support Latinas to secure jobs to advance those who are underemployed,” she said.

Gallegos said focusing on self-improvement such as adopting healthier eating habits, committing to weight loss and leading prayer groups helped her find a positive outlook on life during quarantine.

“I have to show my daughter, no matter what happen[s] we have to [stay] positive,” said Gallegos.

She added, “We never realize when you lose something [that] it’s because better things are coming ahead.”",,

Latinos see new meaning in Dia de Los Muertos after losing loved ones to COVID-19,"Latinos see new meaning in Dia de Los Muertos after losing loved ones to COVID-19 Health officials say Latinos are dying at a disproportionately high rate

Álvaro Paulino Jr. and his mariachi are used to performing at parties throughout New York City this time of year, but nearly eight months into the coronavirus pandemic, his main events are now for mourners.

“We are here to say farewell to the loved ones who lost their battles against COVID-19,” said Paulino at a recent funeral mass held earlier this month in Brooklyn, New York.

Dressed in pressed charro suits, Mariachi Tapatío de Álvaro Paulino played hymn after hymn throughout the service for the parishioners in attendance -- all of whom make up a tight-knit community of Mexican immigrants from Chinantla, Puebla.

“When they hear our notes, our songs and our lyrics, we want them to feel that they’re in Mexico, that they’re there with their families, [to] connect them in some kind of way,” said Paulino.

Maria Alvarez volunteered to organize the funeral mass for the 25 members of their community who died of COVID-19.

“It affected us a lot. We lost a lot of people from COVID,” said Alvarez. “That’s why we asked to do it now in October because it’s for the Día de Los Muertos.”

Día de Los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a widely celebrated holiday in Mexico and other Latin American countries to commemorate loved ones who have passed away.

This year, the holiday has taken on a tragic new meaning for people like Lucero Martinez Felipe. At the funeral mass, Martinez Felipe solemnly read a long list of names of people from her community who have died during the pandemic, including her mother, Paula Felipe Ramos.

“She had just flown back from Mexico. I was finishing my last semester of college ... and she knew I needed help with my 6-year-old son,” said Martinez Felipe. “She had gone for two weeks ... and we believe she got sick somewhere in the airport.”

Her mother, Felipe Ramos, died of COVID-19 on April 16th at NYU Langone's Tisch Hospital just three weeks after getting sick with the virus. At the time, COVID-19 cases were growing exponentially in New York City and it was quickly becoming the epicenter of the global pandemic. Martinez Felipe was unable to have a funeral for her.

“I miss her and I needed to find certain peace in myself,” said Martinez Felipe after the funeral mass ended. “I was able to actually feel peace for the first time since the day of her passing.”

Martinez Felipe’s community is just one of many Latino communities across the country being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, which is killing them at a disproportionately high rate. A recent analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of 114,411 deaths related to COVID-19 between May and August found 24% were Hispanic or Latino, despite this group comprising only 18% of the U.S. population.

Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, is growing more alarmed by the data. During a virtual Congressional Hispanic Caucus briefing in late September, Dr. Hotez described the impact of Covid-19 on Latinos as a “historic decimation.”

“Given the fact it's hitting Hispanics in their 40s, 50s and 60s, what that really means is it's robbing families for this whole generation of their mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters,” said Hotez in an interview with ABC News.

“It's been really devastating not only in terms of the number of people who are dying, but also affecting a much younger age group,” he added.

Health experts say the reasons behind the coronavirus’ disproportionate toll on Latinos is multifaceted.

“We are much more likely to be essential workers. We have to be out there in the pandemic. Some of them had to take public transportation. There was no choice,” said Dr. Olveen Carrasquillo, a Puerto Rican native and chief of internal medicine at the University of Miami health system. “Many of us live in more crowded housing, places of higher social density. All those things have been a major issue why Latinos are at higher risk.”

Carrasquillo is leading one of the clinical trials for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and is calling for more diverse participants.

“We need more minorities -- both Latino [and] African American -- to participate in these studies. The problem is our risk factors are different,” said Carrasquillo. “We need to make sure these vaccines work on our people.”

Martinez Felipe believes it has not been a fair fight for Latino communities like her own.

“We're losing more people because of our economic situations. Most of our families can't stay home, can't stop going to work,” said Martinez Felipe. “Sometimes I feel like I'm this close to just giving up, but I fight hard because I believe that's what my mom would have wanted for me and for my son.”

This Día de Los Muertos, Martinez Felipe plans to arrange photos of her mom on an ofrenda -- an altar filled with deceased loved ones’ favorite things.

“My mother had a tradition for Día de Los Muertos. She would always go to Mexico. She would leave the 27th or 28th of October, and she would put what we call 'una ofrenda,' to my grandparents, to my uncles, my aunts that have passed away, and I intend to do the same.”",,
Couple celebrates 70th wedding anniversary after overcoming COVID-19,"Couple celebrates 70th wedding anniversary after overcoming COVID-19 ""Thank God we got through it for our age,"" said Marie Orlando.

A Pittsburgh-area couple celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary after they both beat COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

Steve and Marie Orlando, ages 92 and 89, respectively, got married on Sept. 2, 1950, in Pittsburgh, just one year after meeting when Steve played on the same sandlot football team as Marie's brother.

When they wed, Marie had just graduated from high school the prior year and Steve had just ended two years of duty in the U.S. Army.

The couple, who settled in a Pittsburgh suburb, had plans to celebrate their 70th anniversary this year with their six children, 15 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren, but the coronavirus pandemic threw off their plans.

The Orlandos, who live close to four of their children, isolated themselves in the home they've shared for more than 30 years beginning in March, when the pandemic began to spread in the U.S.

""We were stuck in the house,"" Marie told ""Good Morning America."" ""Our daughters would go shopping for us and cook for us and leave things [at the door].""

When Marie had to go in the hospital in July for a heart valve replacement surgery, one of the Orlandos' daughters, Janet Bartley, went with her.

They later both tested positive for coronavirus, along with Steve and Bartley's family as well.

""It was our worst fear that they would get it,"" Bartley said. ""And then we all did.""

Steve was hospitalized for two days due to dehydration but otherwise all family members, including Marie, had mild symptoms and were able to recover, a miracle given the Orlandos' age, according to the family. People age 60 and older are at high risk of complications from COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

""Thank God we got through it for our age,"" said Marie. ""I just feel sorry for a lot of people our age who didn’t make it.""

Because they were still recovering from the virus, the Orlandos had to wait until more than one month after their anniversary to celebrate.

Steve, a plumber, and Marie, a homemaker, were celebrated last Saturday at a small party with family members.

Their six children, who live in the Pittsburgh area as well as Florida and Texas, credit their parents with showing them what it takes to have a long and happy marriage.

""They showed me what the true meaning of love is,"" said Bartley, who has been married for 36 years. ""They were wonderful role models.""

""[They showed us] how to get along with your partner and love every minute that you have with them,"" said another daughter, Annamarie Kison, who was married to her husband for 47 years before his death.

The Orlandos say their long-lasting love comes down to good family and good health.

""We lived a clean life, a good life,"" said Steve, who still goes into work with his grandson, who has taken over his plumbing business. ""I have a happy family and we do everything together.""

Added Marie, ""Sometimes it’s a little hard when you start out, but if you really love each other enough you can bear it and just enjoy yourself and then the children come along and it’s like a whole different life. It was a lot of fun.""",,
Head of church in Montenegro dies after COVID-19 infection,"Head of church in Montenegro dies after COVID-19 infection The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro has died in a hospital after contracting the coronavirus

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro, which led months of protests against the small Balkan state’s pro-Western government that was voted out of power in August, has died in a hospital after contracting the coronavirus, the church said Friday.

The condition of Bishop Amfilohije deteriorated on Thursday after he developed heavy breathing and chest pains, doctors said. He had been taken to a hospital in the capital, Podgorica, earlier in October after testing positive for the virus.

The church said the 82-year-old died Friday from pneumonia caused by COVID-19.

Ahead of a parliamentary election in August, followers of the Serbian Church led by Amfilohije staged months of protests against a property law adopted by the parliament in December.

The pro-Russian church argued that the law allows the Montenegrin state to confiscate its property as a prelude to setting up a separate Montenegrin church. The government denied that claim.

The protests, some held in defiance of a ban on public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic, managed to galvanize the opposition, which narrowly won the vote.

Amfilohije, known for his staunch anti-Western and pro-Russian political views, played a key role in leading the anti-government protests and putting together an opposition coalition that is currently trying to form the country’s new government.

Montenegro’s prime minister-designate, Zdravko Krivokapic, called on authorities to declare a day of mourning for Amfilohije.

“I am convinced that the church got a (new) saint today,” Krivokapic declared, describing Bishop Amfilohije as “one of the greatest among us in this century.”

President Milo Djukanovic, who was the main target of the anti-government protests, said he was “saddened"" by the bishop's death but added that history would judge Amfilohije's “overall activity in Montenegro.""

Wearing a traditional bushy beard of Orthodox priests, Amfilohije — whose civilian name was Risto Radovic — was an outspoken supporter of Serb expansionist policies that led to the bloody wars in the Balkans in the 1990's. He was opposed to Montenegro's 2006 independence from Serbia.

Amfilohije once described Muslims as “a false people with a false religion” and was also known for his frequent statements against gay and gender equality groups and abortion rights.

Health contractors vetted stars' politics for US virus ad,"Health contractors vetted stars' politics for US virus ad Public relations firms hired by the Department of Health and Human Services vetted the political views of hundreds of celebrities for a health education advertising campaign on the coronavirus outbreak

WASHINGTON -- Public relations firms hired by the Department of Health and Human Services vetted the political views of hundreds of celebrities for a health education advertising campaign on the coronavirus outbreak, according to documents released Thursday by a House committee.

None of the celebrities agreed to participate — they may not have known they were being vetted — and the campaign has been put on hold as the government reviews its effectiveness.

Director Judd Apatow believes President Donald Trump “does not have the intellectual capacity to run as president,” according to a list of more than 200 celebrities compiled by one of the firms. Singer Christina Aguilera “is an Obama-supporting Democrat and a gay-rights supporting liberal,” the list says, and actor Jack Black is “known to be a classic Hollywood liberal.” A public service announcement by comedian George Lopez was “not moving forward due to previous concerns regarding his comments regarding the president,” according to the documents.

The names were among the spreadsheets, memos, notes and other documents from September and October released by the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

The firms’ vetting came as political appointees planned to spend more than $250 million on a confidence-building campaign surrounding the virus, which has killed more than 227,000 people in the United States and is a core issue in the presidential race between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. While government public health campaigns are routine, the ad blitz planned by HHS was mired from the start by involvement from department spokesman Michael Caputo, a fierce loyalist and friend of Trump with little experience in the field. In September, a spokesman for Caputo said he was taking a medical leave from HHS as he battled cancer.

Trump, a Republican, has repeatedly minimized the dangers of the coronavirus, even as the nation is in its third wave of infections, with tens of thousands of cases reported each day.

According to one memo compiled by a subcontractor to Atlas Research, one of the firms hired by HHS, Caputo suggested a series of soundbites and taglines for the campaign, including “Helping the President will Help the Country.” The notes say that Caputo wanted the campaign to be “remarkable” and to rival the World War II icon Rosie the Riveter, who he said helped galvanize the U.S. against Germany.

“For us, the ‘enemy’ is the virus,” Caputo said, according to the memo.

The documents also show pushback from some of the federal employees leading the work, who removed Caputo from an email chain and thanked one of the contractors for dealing with a “challenging” environment.

The Democrat-led Oversight panel said Caputo was overstepping his bounds, interfering in work that is supposed to be done by contract officers at the department and politicizing what is supposed to be nonpartisan.

“Of course, it is completely inappropriate to frame a taxpayer-funded ad campaign around ‘helping’ President Trump in the weeks and days before the election,” said House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and Reps. James Clyburn of South Carolina and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, both subcommittee chairmen, in a letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “This theme also ignores the reality that more than 220,000 Americans have died from coronavirus — a fact that should not be whitewashed in a legitimate public health message.”

Azar put the entire project on hold earlier this month, telling the Oversight subcommittee led by Clyburn that it was being investigated internally.

“I have ordered a strategic review of this public health education campaign that will be led by our top public health and communications experts to determine whether the campaign serves important public health purposes,” Azar told the subcommittee, which is investigating the federal government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak.

Because public health policy around the coronavirus pandemic has become so politically polarized, it’s unclear how well a confidence-building campaign from the government would play.

HHS officials acknowledge a major challenge to any campaign would involve finding trusted intermediaries to make the pitch to average Americans. On health care matters, people usually trust doctors first, not necessarily celebrities. And Trump has alienated much of the medical establishment with his dismissive comments about basic public health measures, such as wearing masks.

The 34-page “PSA Celebrity Tracker” compiled by Atlas Research and released by the committee does not say whether the celebrities were aware they were even being considered or if they had agreed to participate. The report says that no celebrities are now affiliated with the project but a handful did initially agree to participate.

Singer Marc Antony, who has been critical of Trump, pulled out after seeking an amendment to his contract to “ensure that his content would not be used for advertisements to re-elect President Trump.”

Actor Dennis Quaid also initially agreed and then pulled out, according to a document from Atlas Research. In an Instagram video post last month titled “No good deed goes unpoliticized,” Quaid said he was frustrated that a taped interview he did with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, for the campaign was portrayed in the media as an endorsement of Trump.

“Nothing could be further from the truth,” Quaid said, noting that the interview was still available on his podcast.

Antony and Quaid were among just a few celebrities who were approved for the campaign, according to the documents. Others included TV health commentator Dr. Oz and singer Billy Ray Cyrus.

“Spokespeople for public service campaigns should be chosen on their ability to reach the target audience, not their political affiliation,” the letter from the Democrats reads. “Yet, documents produced by the contractors indicate that the Trump Administration vetted spokespeople based on their political positions and whether they support President Trump.”

The Latest: Spain to keep state of emergency until May 2021,"The Latest: Spain to keep state of emergency until May 2021 Spain’s parliament has voted to keep the country’s state of emergency in place until May 2021 to try to rein in the resurging coronavirus pandemic

MADRID — Spain’s parliament has voted to keep the country’s state of emergency in place until May 2021 to try to rein in the resurging coronavirus pandemic.

The government and parliament agreed Thursday to vote again in March on possibly ending the state of emergency.

Spain announced its second nationwide state of emergency Sunday, imposing an 11 p.m.-6 a.m. nationwide curfew, except in the Canary Islands. It allows the country’s 17 regions to set more restrictions, such as regional border closures.

Last week, Spain became the first European country to surpass 1 million officially recorded coronavirus cases. The death toll is at least 35,000. Health experts say the true figure could be three times higher because of a lack of testing and reporting.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:

WARSAW, Poland — Poland’s prime minister says he’ll try to avoid a national lock-down as long as possible despite a steep spike in infections.

Mateusz Morawiecki spoke a new temporary hospital for up to 1,200 COVID-19 patients that’s been readied at the National Stadium in Warsaw but is not in use yet.

Morawiecki appealed to all citizens to strictly observe distancing and hygiene rules to help prevent the hospitals from filling up.

Poland reached more than 20,100 new daily cases of infection on Thursday, raising the total to nearly 320,000 in the central European nation of 38 million.

All of Poland is a “red zone” since Saturday, meaning that masks must be worn outdoors, shops have limits of clients, restaurants can only do takeout food and fitness centers are closed.

Morawiecki appealed to people demonstrating against a recent tightening of the abortion law to refrain from more street protests because they may spread the virus.

LONDON — Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says restrictions are working to limit the resurgence of the coronavirus.

While announcing a new five-tiered system for restrictions in the country, Sturgeon says the “early” decision to impose restrictions are reducing the growth of new infections.

She told Scottish lawmakers in Edinburgh there were “some encouraging signs,” with new cases increasing by only 4% on a weekly basis compared with 40% two weeks ago.

The Scottish government closed pubs and restaurants across central Scotland on Oct. 9, including in the two biggest cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh.

The other nations of Britain — England, Wales and Northern Ireland — also have tightened restrictions.

MADISON, Wis. — The University of Wisconsin-Madison will resume enrolling patients for a coronavirus vaccine trial next week.

Thirty-six people had received the first of two shots before the study at the School of Medicine and Public Health was paused in September.

The study is for a coronavirus vaccine produced by Oxford University and the British pharmaceutical manufacturer AstraZeneca, which announced last Friday that testing would resume after it got clearance from the Food and Drug Administration.

Testing of AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate was paused after a study volunteer developed a serious health issue. Such temporary halts of drug and vaccine testing are relatively common. It allows researchers time to investigate whether an illness is a side effect or a coincidence.

The school will resume enrolling volunteers, Wisconsin Public Radio News reported.

On Wednesday, the state reported 3,800 new coronavirus cases and 45 deaths, bringing the death toll to 1,897 in Wisconsin. The positivity rate for the most recent seven-day period was the state’s highest at 27.2%.

There were a record 1,439 people hospitalized with the virus in the state Wednesday, including 339 patients in intensive care.

BUCHAREST, Romania — Romania’s infections spiked to more than 6,000 daily cases on Thursday.

The 6,481 cases were a record for a second consecutive day, bringing the total number of infections to 229,040 since late February.

President Klaus Iohannis says the central government is not considering a national lockdown. Some localities have stepped up restrictive measures in recent days to stem the spread of the virus.

Romania has reported 6,764 deaths from the pandemic.

VATICAN CITY — The Vatican is ending Pope Francis’ general audiences with the public amid a surge in coronavirus cases in Italy and a confirmed infection at last week’s encounter.

The Vatican says Francis would resume livestreaming his weekly catechism lessons from his library in the Apostolic Palace, as he did during the Vatican’s coronavirus lockdown during the spring and summer.

Francis resumed his Wednesday general audiences on Sept. 2 in a Vatican courtyard with limited numbers of faithful.

Francis’ decision to not wear a mask during his audiences has drawn criticism on social media, especially when he would greet prelates at the end of the audience. The Vatican said Thursday that someone who attended the Oct. 21 audience tested positive, though it didn’t say if that person was among those who greeted the pontiff.

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin assured there’s no plans to impose a nationwide lockdown, despite reaching a daily record of 17,717 new infections on Thursday.

”(We) are not planning to impose all-out restrictive measures, launch a so-called nationwide lockdown, when the economy and businesses shut down completely,” Putin said at an investment forum. “Despite a difficult epidemiological situation, right now we’re much better prepared for working during an epidemic.”

Russia has had a resurgence of the coronavirus in the past two months, with new infections spiking from 5,000 a day in early September to more than 16,000 a day this week. Reports have surfaced about overwhelmed hospitals, drug shortages and inundated medical workers.

Russia has the world’s fourth-largest tally of confirmed coronavirus cases with more than 1.5 million. The government’s coronavirus task force has reported more than 27,000 deaths.

CAIRO -- The World Health Organization says the coronavirus pandemic has reached “an alarming juncture” in Eastern Mediterranean countries.

Speaking at a virtual news conference in Cairo on Thursday, Rana Hajjeh, WHO Director of Program Management said: “There are about 3 million confirmed cases in the region and the number of COVID-19 associated deaths exceeds 75,000, with an overall death rate of 2.5%.”

She added the region has recently seen the highest weekly number of cases since the beginning of the pandemic.

“Our first and foremost line of defense in the battle against COVID-19 remains preventive public health and social measures,” said Hajjeh, noting the need for more wearing of masks and social distancing in the region.

The WHO Eastern Mediterranean comprises 21 states and the Palestinian territories, with a total population of more than 580 million.

PRAGUE — The Czech Parliament has approved a government plan to allow up to 300 military medical personnel from NATO and EU countries to help with the coronavirus.

The first group of 28 medical staff is expected from the U.S. National Guard.

The Czech Republic’s daily increase in confirmed cases reached a record 15,663 on Tuesday. There’s been 297,013 confirmed cases, including more than half -- 157,000 -- in the last two weeks.

Also, a new health minister was sworn in. Jan Blatny is replacing epidemiologist Roman Prymula who was dismissed after he was photographed visiting a restaurant.

Restaurants and bars are closed in the country as part of the tight regulations imposed to curb the surge. Prymula denied wrongdoing, saying he went through the restaurant to a private space for a meeting, but offered his resignation.

Blatny, a specialist in pediatric hematology, was deputy director of the University Hospital in the second largest Czech city of Brno. The Czech Republic has reported 2,675 deaths in a country of 10 million.

PARIS — Doctors are expressing relief and business owners despair as France prepares to shut down for a month to try to put the brakes on a fast-moving fall coronavirus outbreak.

Shoppers at a Paris farmers’ market say they were ready to relinquish some freedom given the country’s rising number of virus-related deaths and COVID-19 patients filling French hospitals.

The new lockdown is gentler than the one the French government ordered in the spring, but restaurants and other non-essential businesses have been ordered to close their doors in one of the world’s biggest economies.

French schools will stay open this time to reduce learning gaps and allow parents to keep working. Farmer’ markets, parks and factories can continue operating, officials say.

BERLIN — Germany has begun taking in COVID-19 patients from neighboring countries like it did during the height of the pandemic’s first wave in the spring.

Germany has seen a sharp rise in confirmed virus cases in recent weeks, but the number of new daily infections remains below those even in smaller neighboring countries.

The Foreign Ministry said in a statement to The Associated Press on Thursday that two patients from the Netherlands and two from Belgium have been transferred to hospitals in western Germany in recent days.

In the spring, Germany took in 232 patients requiring intensive care from France, Italy and the Netherlands.

Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has stressed the country remains ready to help allies again, including through a new European coordination office that’s received 220 million euros ($258 million) in funding.

WARSAW, Poland — Poland has registered another sharp spike in confirmed coronavirus cases with a new daily record of more than 20,100.

The spike, from almost 19,000 Wednesday, raised the possibility of the government further tightening restrictions that already call for masks to be worn outdoors and restrictions on shopping, restaurants and fitness activities.

The most affected regions in the nation of 38 million are Poznan, in the west, Warsaw, in central Poland, and Silesia, in the south.

The country also reported 301 more virus-related deaths on Thursday, including 46 people who died of COVID-19 and 255 of the disease combined with other health problems. Health Ministry says Poland has 320,000 confirmed cases and nearly 5,150 deaths.

NAIROBI, Kenya — Africa’s top public health official says the time is now to prepare for a second wave of coronavirus on the continent as countries such as Kenya see infections creep up.

John Nkengasong with the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says Africa is at a “pivotal period and a very trying moment” as confirmed cases surge again in Europe and elsewhere.

He says Africa has made many gains against the coronavirus since the pandemic began and faces a delicate balance as African nations aren’t rapidly locking down like earlier in the year.

“We cannot be saving lives and not the economy,” said Nkengasong, adding the only way to avoid further lockdowns is by increasing public health measures.

Testing for the virus in Africa’ remains relatively low with just 18 million tests conducted so far. The 54-nation continent has over 1.7 million confirmed virus cases — an increase of less than 1% from the previous week — and more than 42,000 virus-related deaths.

The NDB intelligence service says its head, Jean-Philippe Gaudin, tested positive Wednesday and is self-isolating.

The agency says Gaudin isn’t displaying any symptoms and is continuing to work from home.

This month, the head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, his two deputies and other staff members tested positive for the coronavirus.

LONDON -- The British government is insisting that a national lockdown would not be the right approach to deal with the resurgence of the coronavirus even as other countries in Europe are choosing variations of that route.

A day after France and Germany ratcheted up their national responses to contain surges in new infections, hospitalizations and deaths, Britain’s Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it is “right we try everything in our powers to avoid a blanket national lockdown.”

He said the virus is “very concentrated in some places” so the correct approach is to target restrictions on those areas with the worst outbreaks.

The British government, which is responsible for public health in England, has set out a three-tiered approach to the virus’ resurgence. In addition to national restrictions such as limiting public gatherings, there are tighter measures in parts of the country where the virus is most prevalent, such as large sections of northern England.

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel told Germans to expect a “difficult winter” as the number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the country hit a new high.

Merkel spoke Thursday in Parliament a day after she and the governors of Germany’s 16 states agreed upon far-reaching restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, including the closure of bars and restaurants, limits on social contacts and bans on concerts and other public events.

Germany’s disease control agency said local health authorities reported 16,774 new positive tests for COVID-19 in the past day, pushing the country’s total close to half a million. The Robert Koch Institute also recorded 89 additional deaths, taking the total to 10,272.

Merkel told lawmakers that Germany is in a “dramatic situation” as it goes into winter, which she said would be “four long, difficult months. But it will end.”

The long-time German leader said authorities had no choice but to drastically reduce social contacts as three-quarters of infections can’t be traced be traced anymore.

“If we wait until the ICUs are full, then it will be too late,” she said.

BRUSSELS — The number of patients in Belgian hospitals is higher than during the first wave of the coronavirus crisis.

The latest figures showed that 5,924 patients were in hospital, surpassing the previous April 6 record of 5,759. The figures by the Sciensano center underscored the seriousness of the situation, which already pushed authorities to reinforce measures which they had relaxed only a month ago.

Patients in intensive care units reached 993, and virologists have said that unless tougher measures having a quick impact the saturation point of 2,000 patients will be reached on Nov. 6.

On Wednesday, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo promised tougher measures across the nation to avoid a breakdown of the country’s health system.

Germany starts 'wave-breaker' shutdown as Europe locks down,"Germany starts 'wave-breaker' shutdown as Europe locks down Germany has became the latest European country to embark on a partial shutdown as authorities across the continent scramble to flatten a rapid rise in coronavirus infections that threatens to overwhelm health systems

BERLIN -- Several European countries are tightening restrictions this week, starting with a partial shutdown Monday in Germany, as authorities across the continent scramble to slow a rapid rise in coronavirus infections that threatens to overwhelm their health care systems.

Britain and Austria will follow suit later in the week, closing restaurants, bars and many leisure activities. Italy, Greece and Kosovo also announced new measures. In some places, the new rules — which vary in strictness — are prompting violent protests by people frustrated at once again having to forgo freedoms.

But in many, experts are saying they should have come weeks ago — a reflection of the increasingly difficult balance many countries are struggling to strike between controlling the virus and boosting already damaged economies.

“We are aware of the frustration, the sense of loss, the tiredness of citizens, also of the anger which is being manifested in these days, by citizens who find themselves living with new limits to their personal freedom,’’ said Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte, as he defended his government's decision to order new measures.

Restrictions have been slowly ramping up for weeks in many European countries, but virus cases have continued to rise. There was a sign of hope from hard-hit Belgium, however, where a leading virologist said that “the high-speed train is somewhat easing up.”

Overall, Europe has seen more than 270,000 confirmed virus-related deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say case and death figures understate the true toll of the pandemic due to missed cases, limited testing and other reasons.

In Germany, restaurants, bars, theaters, cinemas, gyms and other leisure facilities closed in a four-week “wave-breaker” shutdown that seeks to force daily new infections back down to manageable levels. Germans have been asked not to travel, and hotels are barred from accommodating tourists.

In a worrying sign for a country long praised for its testing and tracing abilities, German officials say they can't track the source of three-quarters of new coronavirus cases. Health Minister Jens Spahn, who himself caught the virus, says he doesn't know where he was infected.

Chancellor Angela Merkel said the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care has doubled in 10 days, and the government couldn't stand by and watch.

“The virus punishes half-heartedness,” she said of the new restrictions, telling Germans that “everyone has it in their own hands” to make them a success.

“We will do try to do everything politically so that this is limited to November,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin. But she stressed that “we are very much dependent on the majority of people simply being sensible and playing along, and so saving others' lives.”

The new restrictions are still milder than the ones Germany imposed in the first phase of the pandemic in March and April. This time, schools, nonessential shops and hairdressers are staying open. Officials will review the situation after two weeks.

England is headed for a tougher lockdown starting Thursday, with nonessential shops and hairdressers closing for a month and people allowed to leave home for only a short list of reasons including exercise. Travel is also discouraged.

The lockdown is supposed to end on Dec. 2, but minister Michael Gove told Sky News on Sunday that couldn't be guaranteed ""with a virus this malignant, and with its capacity to move so quickly.”

The plan, which needs lawmakers' approval, is facing resistance from parts of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's own Conservative Party, which worries about its economic impact. Still, passage is virtually assured because of backing from the opposition Labour Party.

Austria is also introducing new restrictions this week. Starting Tuesday and until the end of November, restaurants and bars are being closed — except for deliveries and takeout, as in Germany and England — and cultural, sports and leisure activities canceled. Residents will be asked to stay home from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. They can go out to exercise or to work, among other things, and nonessential shops will remain open.

In Spain, lawmakers last week approved an extension until May 2021 of the country's state of emergency. The measure puts into place a national nightly curfew and allows regions to impose more localized restrictions, such as limiting movement outside city limits on weekends.

“These measures save lives,” Catalonia police chief Eduard Sallent said. “We are enforcing a measure that is meant to prevent deaths and the collapse of our health care system.”

Spain's curfew drew weekend protests in a dozen cities. Mostly young protesters set fire to vehicles and trash cans, blocked roads and threw objects at riot police.

Cabinet minister José Luis Escrivá told Antena 3 television Monday that “this kind of behavior is to be expected” as people grow weary of restrictions.

Countries including hard-hit Belgium, France, Poland and the Czech Republic already have implemented shutdowns of varying strictness.

In Italy, Conte announced new restrictions including the closure of shopping malls at weekends and of museums. Movement between regions will be limited and a “late-evening” curfew introduced, Conte said, without specifying a time or saying when the measures will take effect.

Greece announced a localized lockdown in its second-largest city, Thessaloniki, and the northern province of Serres.

While cases have been rising and are well beyond governments' comfort zones across the continent, data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control show wide variations in the average number of new cases per 100,000 residents reported over the past 14 days, with Germany's figure of about 215 as of Monday less than half those of Austria and the U.K. The country currently worst hit, Belgium, has 1,735 new cases per 100,000.

A leading Belgian virologist said that “long-expected points of light” are beginning to appear, though the situation remains “extremely worrying.”

“The number of infections and hospital admissions continue to rise but not as fast anymore,” said Steven Van Gucht of the Sciensano government health group.

"In Peru's Cuzco, pandemic devastates tourism and economy","In Peru's Cuzco, pandemic devastates tourism and economy Efraín Valles guided world leaders, pop stars and a princess on exclusive tours through the land of the Incas

CUZCO, Peru -- Efraín Valles guided world leaders, pop stars and a princess on exclusive tours through the land of the Incas. He now makes ice cream to survive amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Valles, once one of the most sought-after tour guides in Cuzco high in Peru's Andes, is one of the 1.3 million people nationwide in a tourism industry devastated by the novel coronavirus and the measures imposed to fight its spread, including international travel restrictions.

Cuzco, the historic capital of the Inca empire near Machu Picchu lives almost entirely from international tourism and is suffering the worst crisis in its recent history. More than 226,000 people who make crafts or work as waiters, hotel staff and taxi drivers, have been plunged into an economic abyss. Merchants say they have lost more than two-thirds of their income.

“We are starting from scratch in an activity that we never thought we were going to do,” said Valles, who together with two of his colleagues have started making artisanal fruit ice creams they sell under the name of “Qosqo Creme.""

The last decade was brilliant for Valles. In 2014, he was called the best guide in the world by British tourism magazine Wanderlust and in 2016 the government made him an ambassador for a marketing strategy to draw more international tourists

He gave tours to Princess Beatrice, granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II, the former president of the World Bank Jim Yong Kim, British singer Ed Sheeran, as well as the grandchildren of U.S. explorer Hiram Bingham, who photographed Machu Picchu in 1911.

But the arrival of the novel coronavirus in March and travel restrictions turned Cuzco, which received more than 1.8 million international visits annually, into a near ghost town. Only Spanish and Quechua can be heard in Cuzco's main square, something unimaginable before the pandemic when it resembled a small Babel with tourists speaking a multitude of languages.

Hotels, travel agencies, jewelry stores, restaurants, cafes, chocolate shops and dollar exchange houses are all closed by the square. Only a few souvenir shops remain open but they go for days without customers.

""I don’t sell anything,” said Lourdes Auca, 50, who reopened her shop selling alpaca wool hats in the plaza two weeks ago. She pays $2,100 a month in rent for the shop and before the pandemic, on a good day, she would earn up to $300. Her two sons have dropped out of college because the family ran out of money.

Ruth Rodríguez, owner of the tourism agency Ruthbela Travel Tours, said that thousands of tourists would normally come on June 24 for Inti Raymi, the Incan festival of the sun. But this year the streets were empty.

“The streets seemed to be crying because there was no one,” said Rodríguez, 37, who has accumulated $13,000 in debt.

Peru's central government created a $143 million fund as a guarantee for banks to loan money to the tourism sector, but Rodríguez says she was recently denied $5,000 by a bank. She contends the fund only favors large business groups.

Fredy Deza, Cusco’s regional director of tourism, said there are 8,000 tour guides in the region who do not have access to these benefits.

“Artisans are not recognized by banks either,” he said.

The government then allocated $4.5 million from the fund to be awarded to guides and artisans who propose new tourist routes or innovative craft projects. At the moment, 129 Cuzco guides and artisans have received grants of $830 for guides and $415 for artisans, according to official data.

The small town of Aguas Calientes, the closest to Machu Picchu, is also a ghost town. More than 60% of its 8,000 inhabitants left as businesses shuttered.

Pilar Pérez, a 34-year-old sweeper, told said that in four years of work, she has never found so little garbage on the streets of Aguas Calientes. “This has never happened,” she said.

Lidu Guzmán, 32, owner of the Luna Muna hostel in Aguas Calientes, has no tourists in her five-story building.

“We are at zero,” she said. “It will be hard until there is a vaccine.”

A recent law designed to protect Machu Picchu's ruins, which sets a limit of 675 tourists per day, will also hurt hotels, owners say. Before, 6,000 tourists arrived on the best days and about 4,000 in the low season.

“It means they will come in the morning and leave in the afternoon,” Guzmán said.

Tourism entrepreneurs in Cuzco believe things could normalize in 2022, but expect that in 2021 they will barely reach 30% of what they earned in 2019. For now, they are focused on attracting business travelers, local tourists and if possible some visitors from nearby countries.

""Our first strategy is to keep the service at the lowest possible cost, trying to optimize the relationship between price and quality,” said Carlos Milla, president of the Cuzco Chamber of Tourism.

Many hotel staff were laid off at the start of the pandemic in March, but their employers have started calling them again.

Cleydy Auca, who graduated as an administrator but cleans hotel rooms, said she was rehired a week ago at Peru's minimum wage.

In seven months of unemployment, the 25-year-old saw her savings of $1,300 disappear buying food for herself and her parents in a poor neighborhood on Cuzco's outskirts.

Now, wearing a mask, cap, gloves and using disinfectant, she cleans the rooms of the few guests who arrive at the hotels.

“It’s scary,” she said as she arranged the white pillows in a room. “But it is scarier to be out of work.”

Valles, the tour guide, sensed the fragility of his job a few weeks after the government announced the quarantine. He had to pay the mortgage on his apartment and the private studies of his three children.

So he started selling avocados dressed in a Superman costume. As others began to sell the same product, he switched to cheese, honey and eggs. Then in June, he joined two tour guide friends in making artisanal ice cream.

He sometimes thinks of his old profession hit by the pandemic.

“You despair,” he said. “You question yourself and you wonder why you didn't study another career.”",,
2nd study testing a COVID-19 antibody drug has a setback,"2nd study testing a COVID-19 antibody drug has a setback For the second time, a study testing an experimental antibody drug for COVID-19 has been paused to investigate a possible safety issue

For the second time, a study testing an experimental antibody drug for COVID-19 has been paused to investigate a possible safety issue in hospitalized patients.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Friday that independent monitors had recommended placing on hold enrollment of the most severely ill patients -- those who need intense oxygen treatment or breathing machines -- because of a potential safety problem and unfavorable balance of risks and benefits.

The study can continue to test the two-antibody drug combo in hospitalized patients who need little or no extra oxygen, the monitors said. Other studies in mild or moderately ill people also are continuing.

Antibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. But it can take several weeks for the most effective ones to form. The experimental drugs aim to help immediately, by supplying concentrated versions of one or two antibodies that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.

Earlier this month, a different group of monitors recommended pausing enrollment in a U.S. National Institutes of Health study testing an Eli Lilly antibody drug to investigate a possible safety issue in hospitalized patients. On Monday, the NIH said no safety problem had been verified, but they stopped the study because the drug didn’t seem to work in that situation.

“These kinds of results are informing us about the timing of the benefit,” said Dr. Myron Cohen, a University of North Carolina virologist who advises the government on COVID-19 treatments.

Tests in animals suggest that antibody drugs work best when given early in infection to lower the amount of virus, he said. Once someone is very sick, the drugs may not help, but it’s too soon to know if that's the case, he said.

Doctors already know that timing can matter when it comes to COVID-19 treatments. Studies suggest that dexamethasone and other steroids can lower the risk of death when given to very sick patients to tamp down an over-active immune system, but they may be harmful for those who are only mildly ill.

Lilly and Regeneron have asked the Food and Drug Administration to allow emergency use of their experimental antibody drugs for mild and moderately ill patients who don’t need hospitalization. President Donald Trump got the Regeneron drug when he was sickened earlier this month.

Regeneron said it would share Friday's advice from independent monitors with the FDA and leaders of a separate study in the United Kingdom testing its drug in hospitalized patients.

Lilly antibody drug fails in a COVID-19 study; others go on,"Lilly antibody drug fails in a COVID-19 study; others go on U.S. government officials are putting an early end to a study testing an Eli Lilly antibody drug for people hospitalized with COVID-19 because it doesn’t seem to help

U.S. government officials are putting an early end to a study testing an Eli Lilly antibody drug for people hospitalized with COVID-19 because it doesn’t seem to be helping them.

Independent monitors had paused enrollment in the study two weeks ago because of a possible safety issue. But on Monday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which sponsors the study, said a closer look did not verify a safety problem but found a low chance that the drug would prove helpful for hospitalized patients.

It is a setback for one of the most promising treatment approaches for COVID-19. President Donald Trump received a similar experimental, two-antibody drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. on an emergency basis when he was sickened with the coronavirus earlier this month.

In a statement Lilly notes that the government is continuing a separate study testing the antibody drug in mild to moderately ill patients, to try to prevent hospitalization and severe illness. The company also is continuing its own studies testing the drug, which is being developed with the Canadian company AbCellera.

Antibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. The experimental drugs are concentrated versions of one or two specific antibodies that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.

Lilly and Regeneron have asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency use authorization for their drugs for COVID-19 while late-stage studies continue. Lilly says its request is based on other results suggesting the drug helps patients who are not hospitalized, and that it will continue to seek the FDA's permission for emergency use.

Do I need to wear a mask if I’m 6 feet away from others?,"Do I need to wear a mask if I’m 6 feet away from others? Experts recommend wearing masks in public and staying at least 6 feet away from others to reduce the risk of a coronavirus infection, but whether you should do both could depend on the situation

Do I need to wear a mask if I’m 6 feet away from others?

Health experts recommend wearing masks in public and keeping your distance from others in most cases, but whether you should do both could depend on the situation.

“There’s no invisible force field at 6 feet,” said Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease expert at George Mason University.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says spread of the virus beyond 6 feet is uncommon but more likely in poorly ventilated spaces. Some health experts say the virus can spread more easily than the agency indicates, and suggest wearing masks even in prolonged outdoor gatherings when people are more than 6 feet apart.

Other factors could also influence whether it’s best to keep your distance while also wearing a mask. When people raise their voices or pant — such as when they sing, shout or exercise — they can expel more respiratory droplets or aerosols, and send them traveling farther through the air. The longer you’re in a situation with potential for exposure to the virus, the greater your risk of infection.

“The reason this stuff is so confusing is people want clear answers, and there’s not a straightforward answer,” said Lisa M. Lee, a public health expert at Virginia Tech.

Since no protective measure is entirely effective, Lee suggests layering safeguards like masks, social distancing and hand washing.

“And your mask is your basic layer,” she said.

Getting in the habit of wearing a mask anytime you leave the house also eliminates having to decide when you should, said Bob Bednarczyk, an expert in infectious diseases at Emory University.

“It’s one less thing to worry about,” he said.

"As cases increase, US coronavirus deaths surpass 225,000","As cases increase, US coronavirus deaths surpass 225,000 America continues to leads the world in COVID-19 casualties.

The U.S. death toll from the novel coronavirus passed another grim milestone Sunday as the number of cases crossed the 225,000 mark.

The Center for Systems, Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon.

By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

The U.S. leads the world in coronavirus deaths and in total cases, which are now over 8.6 million, according to Johns Hopkins. Brazil has the second-highest death toll with nearly 157,000 dead, followed by India with nearly 119,000 deaths, according to the data.

The U.S. surpassed 200,000 dead on Sept. 22.

States across the country continue to report jumps in new coronavirus cases.

On Friday, the Covid Tracking Project recorded a record number of new cases in the country, 83,010, a day after it recorded 82,668. The seven-day average of new cases has been steadily increasing this month, going from 42,348 on Oct. 2 to 66,557 on Oct. 24, according to Covid Tracking Project data.

The seven-day average for U.S. newly reported deaths has also increased throughout the month, going from 703 on Oct. 2 to 807 on Oct. 24, the Covid Tracking Project data said.

Several Midwestern states have seen the greatest increase in cases, including Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana, according to the health data.

Hospitals competing for nurses as US coronavirus cases surge,"Hospitals competing for nurses as US coronavirus cases surge U.S. hospitals are scrambling to hire more nurses as the coronavirus pandemic surges, leading to stiff competition and increased costs

FENTON, Michigan -- As the coronavirus pandemic surges across the nation and infections and hospitalizations rise, medical administrators are scrambling to find enough nursing help — especially in rural areas and at small hospitals.

Nurses are being trained to provide care in fields where they have limited experience. Hospitals are scaling back services to ensure enough staff to handle critically ill patients. And health systems are turning to short-term travel nurses to help fill the gaps.

Adding to the strain, experienced nurses are ""burned out with this whole (pandemic)” and some are quitting, said Kevin Fitzpatrick, an emergency room nurse at Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan, where several left just in the past month to work in hospice or home care or at outpatient clinics.

“And replacing them is not easy,"" Fitzpatrick said.

As a result, he said, the ER is operating at about five nurses short of its optimal level at any given time, and each one typically cares for four patients as COVID-19 hospitalizations surge anew. Hospital officials did not respond to requests for comment.

But the departures are not surprising, according to experts, considering not only the mental toll but the fact that many nurses trained in acute care are over 50 and at increased risk of complications if they contract COVID-19, while younger nurses often have children or other family to worry about.

“Who can actually work and who feels safe working are limited by family obligations to protect their own health,” said Karen Donelan, professor of U.S. health policy at Brandeis University’s Heller School for Social Policy and Management. “All of those things have been factors.”

Donelan said there is little data so far on how the pandemic, which has killed more than 231,000 people in the country, is affecting nursing overall. But some hospitals had a shortage even before the virus took hold, despite a national rise in the number of nurses over the past decade.

With total confirmed coronavirus cases surpassing 9 million in the U.S. and new daily infections rising in 47 states, the need is only increasing.

Wausau, Wisconsin-based Aspirus Health Care is offering $15,000 signing bonuses for nurses with at least a year of experience and hiring contract nurses through private staffing companies to handle a surge in hospitalizations that prompted the system to almost quadruple the number of beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients.

Aspirus, which operates five hospitals in Wisconsin and four in small communities in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, also is moving nurses around between departments and facilities as hot spots emerge, said Ruth Risley-Gray, senior vice president and chief nursing officer at Aspirus.

Outside help still is needed, in part because some nurses have gotten sick from or were exposed to the cornavirus during the current wave, which “came with a vengeance” starting in August, Risley-Gray said. At one point in mid-October, 215 staffers were in isolation after showing symptoms or being exposed to someone who tested positive, and some are just starting to return to work.

Aspirus recently was able to hire 18 nurses from outside agencies, and may need more if the surge continues.

Because the pandemic is surging just about everywhere in the country, hospitals nationwide are competing for the same pool of nurses, offering pay ranging from $1,500 a week to more than $5,000, said April Hansen, executive vice president at San Diego-based Aya Healthcare, which recruits and deploys travel nurses.

She said demand for their services has more than doubled since early in the pandemic when the greatest need was in hot spots like New York and New Jersey and then moved to southern states. In recent weeks the virus has been spiking across the country, with the new hot spots in places like the rural upper Midwest and southern-border communities such as El Paso, Texas.

Now placing nurses where they're needed is “like a giant game of whack-a-mole,” said Hansen, whose company has about 20,000 openings for contract nurses.

In North Dakota, where infection rates are exploding, hospitals may cut back on elective surgeries and seek government aid to hire more nurses if things get worse, North Dakota Hospital Association president Tim Blasl said.

In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott recently announced he was sending 75 nurses and respiratory therapists to El Paso to help handle the city's surge. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, meanwhile, issued emergency orders making it easier for nurses from elsewhere to practice in his state and for retired nurses to come back.

“This has been a challenge, and we've been pleading with the community members to protect themselves and others,” by wearing masks and social distancing, said Aspirus' Risley-Gray, who said the positivity rate among community members tested by Aspirus rose from under 10% in September to 24% last week.

To combat the emotional toll and fatigue that comes with caring for COVID-19 patients, including just donning and removing protective equipment all day, Aspirus has been giving nurses microbreaks and quiet places to get away and collect themselves when they feel overwhelmed.

Travel nurses say the need at small hospitals tends to be greater than at larger facilities.

Robert Gardner, who's currently assigned to a hospital in a small town about 20 miles west of Atlanta, said he did search and rescue in the Coast Guard during Hurricane Katrina and the pandemic is “a lot worse.”

He worked at a large New Jersey hospital when that state was swamped by the virus in the spring, and now worries that flu season could bring further chaos to hospitals. But he's determined to stick it out, no matter what.

“It’s not even a question,” Gardner said. “Nursing is a calling.”",,
WHO chief Tedros to quarantine after contact gets COVID-19,"WHO chief Tedros to quarantine after contact gets COVID-19 The head of the World Health Organization says he will self-quarantine after being identified as a contact of a person who tested positive for COVID-19

GENEVA -- World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he will self-quarantine after being identified as a contact of a person who tested positive for COVID-19. A top WHO official focusing on the pandemic said Monday there has been no transmission at the agency's Geneva headquarters.

The 55-year-old Tedros tweeted late Sunday that he is “well and without symptoms,” but will self-quarantine in “coming days, in line with WHO protocols, and work from home.” His agency followed that up on Monday with its own tweet apparently aimed to dispel misinformation about his decision, writing: “Contrary to some incorrect reports, @DrTedros hasn’t tested positive for #COVID19.”

But the agency suggested later that Tedros hadn't been tested at all — and wasn't required to undergo a test under its current protocols. Tedros and WHO didn't identify the contact who had tested positive.

Speaking at a regular WHO briefing, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for the COVID-19 pandemic, said there had been no transmission of the virus at the agency's main site in Geneva — a city like others across Europe that has faced a spike in cases in recent days, prompting new lockdown measures by local authorities.

“We haven’t had any transmission take place on the premises, and we have no clusters on the premises,” Van Kerkhove said. “But it is something that we’re monitoring every day.”

Dr. Mike Ryan, the WHO's emergencies chief, said its “current protocols” don't require Tedros to be tested for the virus, and said “his testing will depend on the arrival of symptoms or otherwise, and he may be tested in the days to come.""

WHO has tallied “a number of cases” since the outbreak swept the globe earlier this year, Ryan said, adding that “most cases have been acquired at community level, very few within the building here.""

Asked about the contradiction about whether any transmission had occurred on-site, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said the public position from the agency was that there has been none at headquarters.

Tedros’ self-quarantine highlights the risks and challenges that many businesses and organizations face in keeping COVID-19 at bay, and who a U.N. agency office teeming with medical experts, renowned scientists and specialists on viruses is no exception.

Ryan noted that staffers who enter the building undergo temperature checks upon arrival, are asked to self-declare about their health status every day, and can benefit from “an immediate response mechanism” if he or she becomes ill at home or the office.

“This is not a zero-risk situation. We’ve said it again and again,” he said. “There is ... no environment right now in the world without risk.”

The WHO director-general and his team have been at the forefront of the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected at least 46.5 million people and led to more than 1.2 million deaths, according to a count of confirmed cases by Johns Hopkins University.

Cases have been increasing in Geneva, where tighter restrictions were announced Sunday aimed to curb the spread of the virus. More than 1,000 new cases have been recorded each day recently in an area of about 500,000 people, local officials said Sunday.

In what have become twice-weekly WHO news conferences, Tedros and other leaders of the health agency have generally opted not to wear protective masks, insisting that they have taken other precautions such as physical distancing and ensuring good air circulation in the vast conference room where the briefings take place.

Officials at WHO Europe in Copenhagen, however, regularly wear masks during their weekly news conferences in an effort to send a signal to viewers about precautions to take.",,
"More US patients to have easy, free access to doctor's notes","More US patients to have easy, free access to doctor's notes Patients soon will have free, electronic access to the notes their doctors write about them under a new federal requirement for transparency

More U.S. patients will soon have free, electronic access to the notes their doctors write about them under a new federal requirement for transparency.

Many health systems are opening up records Monday, the original deadline. At the last minute, federal health officials week gave an extension until April because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Britta Bloomquist of Duluth, Minnesota, has been reading her clinical notes for years, first struggling through red tape and more recently clicking into a secure online patient website.

“It means information about your care can no longer be hidden from you. And you have a say in your care,” said Bloomquist, 32, who has a rare type of arthritis that took years to diagnose.

WHAT'S CHANGING?

Patients have long had a right to their medical records, including doctor notes, but obtaining them could mean filling out requests, waiting for a response and paying fees. A 2016 law said delays and barriers must be removed.

If you already use a patient portal such as MyChart to email your doctor or schedule an appointment, you may soon see new options allowing you to view your doctor's notes and see your test results as soon as they are available. You may get an email explaining where to look, how to share access with a caregiver and how to keep other eyes off your information.

Many people won't notice a change. About 15% of health care systems already are letting patients read doctor notes online without charge. That means about 53 million patients already have access to their doctor’s notes.

WILL THIS HELP ME?

Studies have shown that patients who read their notes understand more about their health, take their medications as prescribed more often and feel more in control of their care.

That's true for Bloomquist. Diagnosed with a rare type of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis, she had extensive surgery to straighten her right leg in 2018. She gets regular drug infusions and sees multiple specialists. It’s a lot to remember.

“I’ve become a health nerd,” Bloomquist said. “Reading the notes has kept me on the same page as my providers about what’s going on.”

WILL I UNDERSTAND THE JARGON?

You may have to look up terms. Or ask you doctor to translate at your next visit. And doctor's notes tend to use abbreviations. ""SOB"" means short of breath, by the way. “BS” can mean bowel sounds.

And brace yourself if your weight is an issue.

“I’m a heavy-set person, OK? And their favorite word to use is obese,” said Rosie Bartel, 71, of Chilton, Wisconsin. “You have to get used to that. Doctors use that word.”

To Bartel, who became more involved in her care after getting an infection in the hospital, reading notes means she's doing what she can to prevent errors and stay healthy.

“I don't have to remember everything said to me in a 15-minute appointment,"" she said.

WHAT IF I SPOT AN ERROR?

Patients do find mistakes in their notes and some errors are serious enough to affect their care, research has found.

“A clinician has eyes on thousands of notes, but a patient has eyes only on one, so it has powerful safety implications,” said Cait DesRoches, director of OpenNotes, a Boston-based group working for greater access to patient notes.

Bloomquist, the Minnesota patient, learned that it’s difficult to fix inaccuracies in her medical record. Some of her notes say her surgery was on her left leg. It was on her right. She said she reported the error several times but it hasn't been fixed.

ARE THERE EXCEPTIONS?

Psychotherapy notes don't need to be shared with patients. And doctors can hold back a note if they think it will cause physical harm, such as a note about domestic violence if the abuser has access to the patient's health information.

As for parent access to teenagers' information, state laws vary, DesRoches said. That means some health systems allow parents to see at least some of their teenager's notes, while others do not.

Parents can check with their children's doctors to find out how it works in their states.

WHAT DO DOCTORS THINK?

Some doctors worry this will mean more phone calls from confused patients.

Dr. Marlene Millen of UC San Diego Health, which launched a pilot program for primary care patients in 2018, said that's not her experience.

“I did not get a big bump in questions at all,” Millen said.

Many patients aren't interested in their notes and never read them, she said. Others do, but save her time because they arrive for appointments “and already know what the next step in the plan is because they had read the prior note.”

UC San Diego Health is opening notes to another 130,000 patients Monday, as more specialists are added. Millen, who's been highly involved in the transition, said it's frustrating the federal deadline was extended just last Thursday.

“We spend all this time getting ready and we could have spent that time doing other things like working on the pandemic,"" she said.

UK says 4-week coronavirus lockdown may have to last longer,"UK says 4-week coronavirus lockdown may have to last longer The British government says a new national lockdown in England may have to last longer than the planned four weeks if coronavirus infection rates don’t fall quickly enough

LONDON -- A new national lockdown in England may have to last longer than the planned four weeks if coronavirus infection rates don’t fall quickly enough, a senior government minister said Sunday.

The lockdown announced Saturday by Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to run from Thursday until Dec. 2. Johnson says it's needed to stop hospitals from becoming overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients within weeks.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove said it was the government’s “fervent hope” that the lockdown would end on time, but that could not be guaranteed.

“With a virus this malignant, and with its capacity to move so quickly, it would be foolish to predict with absolute certainty what will happen in four weeks’ time,” he told Sky News. “We’re going to review it on the 2nd of December but we’re always driven by what the data says.”

Under the new restrictions, bars and restaurants can only offer take-out, non-essential shops must close and people will only be able to leave home for a short list of reasons including exercise. Hairdressers, gyms, golf courses, swimming pools and bowling alleys are among venues that must shut down, and foreign holidays are barred.

Unlike during the U.K.’s first three-month coronavirus lockdown earlier this year, schools, universities, construction sites and manufacturing businesses will stay open.

Britain has the worst virus death toll in Europe, with more than 46,700 dead. It passed 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases on Saturday and confirmed another 23,254 new infections on Sunday.

Like other European countries, virus cases in the U.K. began to climb after lockdown measures were eased in the summer and people began to return to workplaces, schools, universities and social life. In recent weeks, new infections have been soaring across the continent, especially in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Spain and the U.K.

Johnson had hoped regional restrictions introduced in October, mostly in northern England, would be enough to push the numbers of new infections down. But government scientific advisers predict that on the outbreak’s current trajectory, the demand for hospital beds will exceed the capacity by the first week of December, even if temporary hospitals are set up again.

“Unless we act, we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day,” Johnson said as he announced the lockdown during a televised news conference on Saturday evening.

But owners of pubs, restaurants, theaters and gyms all say the measures will be devastating.

A government program that has paid the wages of millions of furloughed employees during the pandemic has been extended during the new lockdown. Many businesses say that is not enough, especially in the arts, where most people work as freelancers.

Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venue Trust, urged the government to offer the live events industry further financial support, as has been done in France and Germany.

“We look forward to urgent details from ministers on the financial package that will protect businesses and livelihoods in this vital, world-leading British industry,” he said.

Also Sunday, the government and Transport for London struck a deal to keep buses and subways running in the capital, where passenger numbers have collapsed because of the pandemic. The mix of grants and loans worth 1.8 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) is earmarked to keep the system operating until the end of March.

Under the new restrictions, places of worship can stay open for private prayer and funerals, but not for communal services. That has drawn criticism from England’s top two Roman Catholic clergy, Cardinal Vincent Nichols and Archbishop Malcolm McMahon, who say the suspension would cause “deep anguish.""

“Faith communities have played a vital role in sustaining personal, spiritual and mental health and encouraging vital charitable activities” during the pandemic, they said. “That critical service towards the common good of all is created and sustained by communal worship.”

The new lockdown needs Parliament’s approval and a vote is scheduled for Wednesday. Some members of Johnson’s Conservative Party oppose tighter restrictions because of the economic damage they inflict, but the main opposition Labour Party says it will vote for the new lockdown.

The restrictions will apply to England. Other parts of the U.K. govern their own public health measures, with Wales and Northern Ireland already effectively in lockdown and Scotland under a set of tough regional restrictions.

Pre-election virus spike creates concerns for polling places,"Pre-election virus spike creates concerns for polling places A surge in coronavirus cases across the country, including in key presidential battleground states, is creating mounting health and logistical concerns for voters, poll workers and political parties ahead of Election Day

IOWA CITY, Iowa -- A surge in coronavirus cases across the country, including in key presidential battleground states, is creating mounting health and logistical concerns for voters, poll workers and political parties ahead of Election Day.

In Iowa, where both presidential campaigns are competing feverishly, county officials said they were preparing for scores of confirmed or potentially infected people to vote curbside. It's an option typically used by disabled people that must be available outside every polling place.

Linn County Supervisor Stacey Walker, in Cedar Rapids, encouraged people to cast their ballot but said they should take safety precautions at polling places to protect themselves and their neighbors.

“We can’t afford to have Election Day serve as a superspreading event across the state and country,"" he said.

At a news conference this past week, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said his office had distributed 145,000 gloves, 200,000 masks and 11,000 social-distancing markers for use by voters and poll workers.

In Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers sought to assure voters in the critical swing state that going to the polls would not be risky, even as officials announced more than 5,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday.

“For those who are voting in person now, I believe it’s safe,” Evers said, adding that polling places have adequate supplies to protect voters.

Across the country, Republicans worked to downplay any concerns that health risks will keep some of their voters home, after Democrats heavily promoted mail-in and early in-person balloting to their voters.

Republicans are counting on a huge Election Day turnout among their supporters to offset the big leads in early voting among Democrats in states that are pivotal to the presidential race.

“If you were worried about voting at the polls on Election Day, you’ve probably already voted,” said John March, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Virginia.

Like many other states, Iowa this week reported its highest number of average daily new cases and hospitalizations to date.

In Cedar Rapids, public health officials called a news conference Friday to express alarm at the spike in cases in Linn County, including a single-day high reported Thursday of more than 200. They urged residents to avoid gatherings while advising those who visit polling places to wear masks, stay 6 feet apart and wash their hands afterward.

Linn County Auditor Joel Miller said a woman who acknowledged she was positive for coronavirus voted curbside Thursday at a mall where early voting is taking place, the first known infected voter in the county. Poll workers gave her a face shield and gloves and isolated everything she touched, he said.

Several other voters who were awaiting test results or wanted to avoid the line for health reasons also used it, and county auditors were preparing for a major increase in the rarely-used option Tuesday.

Under curbside voting, residents call a phone number for assistance from their vehicle and a bipartisan poll worker team is sent to help them cast ballots.

Miller, 65, said he is concerned about contracting the virus after spending hours this week assisting voters and will get tested again Sunday. He said he was worried about the virus spreading at polling places Tuesday, noting that voters cannot be required to wear masks.

“Heck yes I’m concerned. I’m going to have 500 people working on Tuesday. I don’t want it on my conscience that somebody caught COVID at a polling place and got sick,” he said. “It could happen. It could happen to me.”

County auditors have small full-time staffs and rely on experienced polling place workers to run smooth elections. They say they are worried that any of those workers who test positive before Tuesday will be replaced with less experienced people, which could lead to long lines.

In Davenport, Iowa, Scott County Auditor Roxanna Moritz asked her employees several days ago to self-quarantine to avoid the possibility of catching the virus before Tuesday.

Moritz said she has received several calls this week from people who have tested positive or are hospitalized with coronavirus seeking advice on how to vote. One woman was crying over the situation.

Her staff is working with hospitals to deliver ballots to patients and is promoting curbside voting for those infected at early voting locations and on Election Day. She said curbside voting is labor intensive and risky.

“Some of my poll workers are a little bit concerned because they are older individuals,” she said. “Still, I would rather do curbside than have them (voters) go to the polls.”

Moritz said she has been relieved by the high number of early voters in her county, which will ease the burden on Election Day. Still, she said she worries that crowded polling places could become a source of spread for the coronavirus.

At a public library in Davenport on Friday, poll workers were sanitizing voting stations and pens between users. People waiting in line outside the library were wearing masks and staying 6 feet apart.

Lenore Benton-Bey, a Davenport retiree, said the socially distanced crowd didn’t bother her: “I’ve got a whole bottle of hand sanitizer in the car,” she said.

Asia Today: Australia reports no new local cases,"Asia Today: Australia reports no new local cases Australia has recorded no new locally transmitted coronavirus infection for the first time in five months

CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia has recorded no new locally transmitted coronavirus infection for the first time in five months.

In Melbourne, the capital of Victoria state, which had the highest number of cases in the country, residents on Sunday enjoyed the first weekend of cafes, restaurants and pubs reopening to walk-in customers.

The city only has one mystery case without a known source. There are 61 active cases left across the state, down from 70 on Saturday.

State Deputy Premier James Merlino hailed Sunday’s zero figures as “another great day for Victoria,” but urged caution ahead of Australia’s most-prestigious horse race on Tuesday, the Melbourne Cup, known as the “race that stops a nation.” Australians traditionally gather in bars or in private homes to watch the event, a public holiday.

The race attracts crowds of more than 100,000 at Melbourne’s Flemington race course, but this year it will held without fans because of restrictions on public gatherings.

Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton urged Victorians to enjoy the Cup but to continue obeying guidance on mask-wearing and social distancing.

“The great majority of Melburnians know what do to,” Sutton said. “There will be a few who may be a bit liberal in their behavior.""

Sutton said the new wave of infections in Europe showed how quickly the coronavirus can reassert itself.

“What Europe is going through now is a consequence of not being able to get to this point where you can stay on top of very low numbers,” he said. “What we have created is very precious and we need to hold onto it tightly.”

Western Australia state on Sunday recorded one new case of COVID-19, a woman who returned from overseas and is in hotel quarantine.

In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:

— India has reported 46,964 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, in a sign of continued downward trend in infections. The Health Ministry on Sunday also registered 470 additional deaths, taking total fatalities up to 122,111. The latest figures take the country’s total virus tally to close to 8.2 million, behind only the U.S. India saw a steep rise in cases in July and added more than 2 million in August and another 3 million in September. But it is seeing a slower pace since mid-September, when daily infections touched a record of 97,894 with the highest number of deaths at 1,275. According to the Health Ministry, more than 7.4 million Indians have recovered from COVID-19. Some experts say the decline in cases suggests that the virus may have finally reached a plateau in India but others question the testing methods and warn that a major festival as well as the winter season could result in new outbreaks.

— Chinese health authorities said Sunday they have found 61 more asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in an outbreak in the remote Xinjiang region, including the first outside the initially affected county. To date, they have identified 54 people with symptoms and another 219 people who tested positive but haven’t shown any symptoms of the disease. The latest asymptomatic cases include 15 in Akto country, which is near Shufu county, where all the previous cases were found. The outbreak, outside the city of Kashgar, appears to be linked to a garment factory in Shufu that employs 252 people and has been sealed off.

Minority US contact tracers build trust in diverse cities,"Minority US contact tracers build trust in diverse cities Across the U.S., people from immigrant, refugee and Black communities are being hired to bridge the cultural divide in the United States and rebuild public confidence in America's public health system

SAN DIEGO -- When a contact tracer called the Iraqi woman to say her 18-year-old daughter tested positive for the coronavirus and could quarantine for free in a hotel, the woman panicked — recalling the family's terror of risking separation forever during their flight from Baghdad after a bomb killed her brother.

The contact tracer, Iraqi immigrant Ethar Kakoz, had made a similar harrowing journey using smugglers to get out of Iraq after her parents were told she could be kidnapped. So Kakoz came up with a safe way for the teen to isolate herself at home in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, knowing the mother couldn't bear to be away from her daughter.

Kakoz is among a growing legion of ethnically and racially diverse contact tracers hired by local health departments to help immigrants, refugees and minorities protect themselves during a pandemic that has disproportionately affected people of color. One call at a time from Southern California to Tennessee, the contact tracers are trying to build confidence in America's public health system.

They have fluency in a multitude of languages, helping them bridge cultural divides and knock down misinformation about the virus circulating among immigrant, Black and Hispanic communities. The challenges include President Donald Trump downplaying it and his declaration that top government scientists are “idiots.”

Contact tracers like Kakoz who are able to connect with people mark a rare success in a contact tracing effort that has largely been a failure nationwide.

While many rich countries like South Korea use extensive contact tracing to contain the virus and reopen their economies, the U.S. has no national program, and local efforts have struggled to get people to cooperate and keep up with all the cases.

Concerns about privacy abound among many Americans, but an inherent distrust of government in communities of color is a compounding factor.

The contact tracers make cold calls from lists provided by local health departments of people who were reportedly within six feet (1.8 meters) of an infected person for more than 15 minutes.

Their goal: Convince them to self-quarantine or take precautions so the virus won't spread. Then some contact tracers act as community health workers by visiting the people to check on them and offering help with paying rent, applications for unemployment benefits and food deliveries.

No prior health training is needed for the program Kakoz works for, a partnership between San Diego State University and San Diego County that hired people from the region's Arabic-speaking, Spanish-speaking, Filipino and Black communities.

Elsewhere around the U.S., Nashville has hired contact tracers fluent in Bengali and Nepali, and Ventura County near Los Angeles is recruiting people who speak Mexico's indigenous Mixtec language.

“Beyond language, knowing what things individual communities care about makes a difference absolutely and is necessary for this work,” said Matt Leger, senior director of CONTRACE Public Health Corps, a consulting firm launched six months ago to help communities set up contact tracing programs.

Kakoz lives in El Cajon, a city of about 105,000 east of San Diego, that is a melting pot for refugees, many of them from Arabic-speaking, war-torn countries.

The pandemic, she said, has triggered anxiety many believed they left behind in their home countries after arriving in the U.S.

“For many of these families it’s really bringing them back to the past and the unsafety they felt during the war, the lack of food, not being able to go to stores,” Kakoz said.

That knowledge helped Kakoz in her interview with the Iraqi woman to come up with a safe plan for the family of six living in a three-bedroom apartment with two bathrooms.

The daughter would stay in one bedroom and be the only person using one bathroom and all family members would wear masks at home. She also put them in touch with counselors who treat war trauma.

“I feel empathy,"" Kakoz said. ""My responsibility is to just educate them and tell them about what is the right thing to do.”

On another call with an Iraqi man, she dispelled his belief that the coronavirus had come from a gas being tested by the U.S. military — which had prompted his wife to keep their windows closed after a cousin was infected.

Kakoz had seen something similar on a local Arabic-language Facebook page and persuaded the man and his wife to open their windows, echoing expert advice to avoid virus-laden droplets from circulating in non-ventilated spaces.

Dr. Hala Madanat, a leading public health researcher at San Diego State University who helped design the program, said she learned how vital people like Kakoz can be from Africa’s experience with the Ebola virus outbreak.

The outbreak was worsened by misinformation and mistrust in the government.

But Nigeria, where community health workers who had been working on polio eradication, quickly pivoted to using them as contact tracers for Ebola and was able to squash its outbreak within months.

Amira Temple, another San Diego State University contact tracer, views her job as an extension of her work as a civil rights activist in San Diego’s Black and Hispanic communities.

“There’s a gap within these communities of food, housing and security so COVID is kind of bringing these things to light,” she said.

A single mother told Temple in a call that she and her son were self-quarantining together after being exposed to an infected person but needed food. Temple dropped boxes of nonperishable goods at the mother's door so they would have enough to eat during their two weeks of quarantine.

“I think about her often,” Temple said. “I’m glad we could fill the holes and let these people know at least while they’re sick, the community has their back.”

After being called by a Spanish-speaking contact tracer when a relative in an apartment upstairs from her tested positive, 77-year-old Mexican immigrant Maria Tellez said she was grateful someone was looking out for her.

San Diego State University contact tracer, Veronica Pelayo, is the daughter of Mexican immigrants. Tellez does not speak English and said she immediately trusted Pelayo.

Pelayo also makes calls to people in the country illegally so she takes care to let everyone she calls know that their information is confidential and attempts in each call “to make it very personal and be very understanding.”

In the call to Tellez, Pelayo stressed the importance of wearing masks. She then followed up by visiting Tellez and the relative during the quarantine period to check on them and make sure they had enough food.

Tellez said the attention “kept our spirits up and made us feel like everything was going to be OK.”

“We no longer felt afraid,"" she said.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:

JERUSALEM - Dozens of members of Israel’s Druze Arab minority stormed a hospital in northern Israel and seized the body of a sheikh who died from the coronavirus. Later Saturday, his followers held a large funeral for him against safety guidelines.

The crowd stormed the hospital late Friday in the northern town of Safed. TV stations showed videos of dozens of followers entering the building. The funeral took place in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights town of Majdal Shams, which has been placed under a lockdown due to the high rate of coronavirus infections. Thousands of Druze people participated in the funeral procession, despite a ban on large gatherings.

Later Saturday, Sheikh Muwafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze sect, said the family of the deceased and the Druze leadership were not consulted before the body was taken from the hospital. He appealed for Druze to abide by health restrictions, Israel’s public radio Arabic service reported.

The Druze community, which follows a secretive offshoot of Islam, generally has good relations with the national government.

The reports say that Israeli police are investigating the incidents.

Israel has begun easing its second nationwide lockdown this month after succeeding in lowering the infection rate, which in September had risen to be one of the highest in the world.

NEW YORK — Federal health officials announced new rules to eventually help cruise ships sail again in U.S. waters.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says companies must demonstrate procedures for testing, quarantining and isolating passengers and crew. Ship owners must test all passengers and crew at the start and end of all voyages, which are limited to seven days.

The companies will need test labs on all ships and arrangements to isolate or quarantine passengers on shore, if needed. The CDC says this may take months to coordinate.

“This framework provides a pathway to resume safe and responsible sailing,” says CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield.

In mid-March, the CDC issued an order suspending cruise ship operations at U.S. ports. That came after coronavirus outbreaks on ships and concerns about spreading the virus. The no-sail order ended Saturday.

Elementary and middle school children can still attend class. However, 75% of high school instruction must be done remotely, in accordance with nationwide rules that started this week.

On Monday, Lombardy’s governor will consult with the local mayors, including of its main city Milan, before deciding whether to lock down the region.

Some citizens have participated in anti-lockdown protests this week to vent their anger about the restrictions. In Florence on Friday night, four demonstrators were detained.

Italy has more than 647,000 confirmed cases and more than 38,000 deaths.

ATLANTA — Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has tested negative for coronavirus after having exposure to someone who tested positive.

A statement on his Twitter account says the Republican governor is quarantining as a precaution. It says first lady Marty Kemp also tested negative.

In a separate announcement Friday, U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson says he tested positive for coronavirus and is working from home while in quarantine. Ferguson appeared with Kemp at a rally on Thursday.

Kemp was among the earliest to allow businesses to reopen. He has avoided a statewide mask mandate, including this summer, when Georgia recorded the highest per capita infections nationwide.

Georgia has 360,000 confirmed cases of the virus and more than 7,950 deaths,

according to the state Department of Public Health.

ATHENS, Greece — Greece will shut down restaurants, bars, cafes, cinemas and gyms across a large part of the country, including the capital Athens, after a surge in coronavirus cases.

Outlining the measures in a televised address, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the changes will take effect Tuesday morning and last for the whole of November.

The areas affected are most of northern Greece and the Athens region.

Though closed for sitting customers, restaurants in these areas will be able to offer food for takeaway and deliveries.

In other measures, Mitsotakis said masks will become mandatory across the whole of Greece and a curfew will come into force from midnight to 5 a.m. University classes across the country will have to be conducted online.

In contrast to the spring lockdown, travel within the country will not be affected and retail shops will stay open.

Like other countries in Europe, Greece is in the grip of a resurgence of the virus. Daily infections surged over 1,000 this week, peaking at 1,690 Friday.

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel is pledging to help companies hit by a new German partial shutdown “quickly and unbureaucratically” as the country reports the latest in a string of daily coronavirus infection records.

German officials decided this week to shut down bars, restaurants and leisure facilities for four weeks starting Monday and impose new contact restrictions. The aim is to curb a rapid rise in new infections and prevent an overwhelmed health system.

The government plans to spend up to 10 billion euros ($11.7 billion) to compensate companies hit by the latest shutdown.

Merkel said in her weekly video message, “we will not leave companies that face difficulties because of the current crisis through no fault of their own alone. We want to help quickly and unbureaucratically.”

On Saturday, the national disease center, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 19,059 confirmed cases in the last 24 hours and 103 deaths. That’s up from the previous record set Friday of 18,681.

Germany’s total cases since the pandemic started has increased to 518,753 and its death toll to 10,452.

"Halloween in the pandemic: Costumes and candy, at a distance","Halloween in the pandemic: Costumes and candy, at a distance Halloween parades, parties and haunted houses were canceled as the coronavirus pandemic left its mark on the holiday and its traditions this year

Ghosts, skeletons, princesses and black cats roamed the streets as usual this Halloween, but they kept their distance, wore face coverings and carried hand sanitizer in their quest for treats.

Like with everything else this year, the pandemic also left its mark on Halloween. Parades, parties and haunted houses were canceled due to bans on large gatherings and concerns that spooky celebrations could spread the coronavirus.

But across the U.S., parents and costumed kids found ways to preserve the essence of the holiday Saturday while also observing the rules of social distancing.

In the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Tomeka Ray took her 4-year-old daughter, Diamond, trick-or-treating in the afternoon. The girl, dressed as a princess, wore her mask and carried sanitizer, with more of the disinfecting gel in the car for good measure, Ray said, so “I wasn’t too worried.""

At one home neighbors had rigged a remote treat-delivery system fashioned out of a ventilation tube, with a cardboard cutout at the end colored to make it look like a dragon's mouth.

“I like that. I really do. That’s the third house I’ve seen that has that,” Ray said.

Caden Korchuk, 11, and friend Jayden Schoning, 10, both dressed as skeletons, also appreciated getting their candy delivered from a distance.

“Everything out here is really cool because of all the chutes,” Korchuk said.

In Glen Allen, Virginia, just outside Richmond, neighbors left individually wrapped bags of candy on tables at the end of driveways to avoid having dozens of kids coming to their doors and sticking their hands in the same big, germy candy bowls.

Matt Cheadle, a 35-year-old furniture designer, called it “extremely” socially distanced trick-or-treating.

Parker, his 5-year-old son, was going as Yoshi, the green dinosaur from the Mario Kart video game series, and the chance to show off his costume and get candy is all he's talked about recently

“He's already had so much taken away from him this year,"" Cheadle said. ""We think this is a small compromise for Halloween. The little kiddos will still dress up, they'll still get to go driveway to driveway, but not door to door.”

Halloween comes as coronavirus cases are surging in many parts of the country and health officials warn of the potential for even higher numbers this winter.

More than 230,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the country, and total U.S. cases surpassed 9 million on Friday. Over the past two weeks, more than 78,700 new virus cases have been reported each day on average, up from about 55,100 in mid-October, according to Johns Hopkins University.

So many cities and towns issued guidelines for celebrating Halloween safely.

New York City’s health department recommended avoiding large groups, haunted houses and bobbing for apples — ""Keep your spit to yourself,” it said in an advisory. Officials urged people instead to focus on safe activities like pumpkin carving, home decorating, outdoor scavenger hunts and virtual costume parties.

Lots of festivities were canceled, including the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, a nearly 50-year tradition that typically draws tens of thousands to the streets of Manhattan. Organizers staged a virtual puppet parade instead.

In New Hampshire, where coronavirus cases are also on the rise, emergency management officials in Coos County recommended residents not participate in door-to-door trick-or-treating or group events. Trick-or-treating was called off entirely in Pittsburg, a town of about 900 in the northern part of the state.

Betsy Curtin of Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania, and her sons were also skipping it for safety's sake. Instead, it was a visit to their grandparents' houses in costume — 7-year-old Alex as Batman and 9-year-old Charlie as Captain America — then back home for pizza and a movie.

“I only bought Kit Kats for them, so I’ve officially ruined their weekend,"" Curtin said. “Hoping the grandparents come through with specialty chocolates.”

Asia Today: Australia to spend on vaccines for wider region,"Asia Today: Australia to spend on vaccines for wider region Australia has announced it will spend $351 million to secure COVID-19 vaccines for the Pacific and Southeast Asia as part of a shared recovery for the region

CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia has announced it will spend 500 million Australian dollars ($351 million) to secure COVID-19 vaccines for the Pacific and Southeast Asia “as part of a shared recovery for our region from the pandemic.”

The government said it would use a range of advance purchase agreements with manufacturers via the global COVAX Facility plan, which aims to ensure virus vaccines are shared with all nations.

“We are committing an additional AU$500 million over three years towards this effort,” it said. “The funding will further help ensure that the countries of the Pacific and East Timor are able to achieve full immunization coverage, and will make a significant contribution toward meeting the needs of southeast Asia.

“A fast, safe vaccine rollout ... will mean we are able to return to more normal travel, tourism and trade with our key partners in the region.”

Meanwhile, officials in Victoria state reported just one new case of COVID-19 on Saturday as Melbourne residents head into a weekend of greater social freedom.

Figures from the state’s Health Department show an average of just 2.4 new cases per day for the past 14 days.

The easing of restrictions means families can visit each other at home. A 25-kilometer (15-mile) travel limit remains in place and outdoor gatherings are still capped at 10 people.

It will be an emotional weekend for many people who have been unable to see their families or close friends for months.

Victoria’s COVID-19 death toll stands at 819 and the national figure is 907.

State premier Daniel Andrews did not face the media on Saturday, bringing his daily news conference marathon to an end. The state leader had held news conferences for 120 consecutive days starting on July 3.

In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:

— For the first time, Sri Lanka police have arrested dozens of people for not wearing masks and failing to maintain social distancing, under the new laws imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Police spokesman Ajith Rohana said 39 people were detained, and separately, another 221 were held for violating a curfew. Since Thursday, the government has imposed the curfew in the whole of Western province where new outbreaks at a garment factory and the main fish market were discovered early this month. It includes the capital Colombo, where nearly 30% of the 22 million population live. Infections from the two clusters have grown to 6,945 by Saturday, bringing to over 10,000 the number of confirmed cases in the country including 19 deaths.

— India has registered 48,268 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours. The Health Ministry on Saturday also reported 551 additional deaths, taking total fatalities up to 121,641. The figure raises the country’s total virus tally to over 8.1 million, behind only the U.S. Over 7.4 million people have recovered. The slowdown in daily infections has held for more than a month with fewer than 60,000 cases for nearly two weeks. Some experts say the trend suggests the virus may have finally reached a plateau in India but others question the testing methods and warn a major festival due in a few weeks and the winter season could result in a new surge. The capital of New Delhi, which recently became the worst-hit city in India, is already witnessing high air pollution levels, making the coronavirus fight more complicated in months ahead.

— China has reported six new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in an outbreak in Xinjiang, bringing the total in the far-west region to 51. Six were in serious condition, Xinjiang health authorities said Saturday. Another 161 people have tested positive but show no symptoms. The outbreak in Shufu county, near the city of Kashgar, appears to be linked to a garment factory that employs 252 people and has been sealed off. China has largely curbed the spread of the coronavirus but continues to see localized outbreaks with infections in the hundreds. The National Health Commission also reported 27 new cases among people who had arrived recently from overseas. The total number of confirmed cases has reached 85,973, including 4,634 who have died. China does not include people without symptoms in its confirmed case count.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:

FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Kentucky reported a near-record number of new coronavirus cases Friday as the surging outbreak continued sending more people to hospitals, Gov. Andy Beshear said.

“This is a dangerous time. We’re moving the wrong way,” the Democratic governor said as he urged Kentuckians to wear masks in public to protect themselves and those around them.

Beshear reported 1,941 new COVID-19 cases — the second-highest statewide daily total since the pandemic began — and 15 more virus-related deaths.

The state’s positivity rate reached 6.19% — the highest level since May 6, he said.

The recent surge has led to rising hospitalizations. On Friday, there were 974 patients hospitalized in Kentucky due to the virus, the governor said, noting the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care rose to 241.

“Remember, the more cases, the more people in the hospital, the more people in the ICU and the more people who die,” Beshear said.

Total statewide COVID-19 cases surpassed 105,000, and the virus-related death toll reached at least 1,476. The latest deaths announced included people ranging in ages from 39 to 91.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Walt Disney World says it plans to lay off more than 11,000 unionized workers because of the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of pandemic-related job casualties at the Florida resort to almost 18,000 positions.

Disney World said in a letter to state and local leaders Thursday that the 11,350 union workers — mostly part-timers — will be laid off at the end of the year. Company officials previously had said that another 6,400 nonunion Disney employees in Florida would lose their jobs.

Earlier this week, 720 Disney World actors and singers were laid off since many of the live entertainment shows at the Florida resort have gone dark, according Actors’ Equity Association, the labor union representing the performers.

The layoffs are part of a decision by The Walt Disney Co. last month to eliminate 28,000 positions in its parks division in California and Florida because of the pandemic.

Disney’s parks closed last spring as the coronavirus began spreading in the U.S. The Florida parks reopened this summer with restrictions on how many people could be in the parks at any given time and new requirements for social distancing and mask-wearing. The California parks have yet to reopen because of restrictions by the state of California.

TOPEKA, Kan. — Kansas counties that require masks have seen about half as many new coronavirus infections as counties that don’t mandate face coverings, a study has found, as cases statewide surged again to record levels.

“Do Masks Matter in Kansas” produced by the Institute for Policy and Social Research at the University of Kansas found that counties that require masks saw a decrease in their seven-day rolling average of daily cases per 100,000 population starting 14 days after the mandate was issued.

“Masks, it is important to note, do not eliminate COVID, but they significantly slow the spread of the disease — at least here in Kansas,” said Donna K. Ginther, the institute’s director, in a video presenting the study’s findings. The Institute for Policy and Social Research at the University of Kansas has been tracking the impact of COVID-19 on the state, The Kansas City Star reported.

Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly tried over the summer to issue a statewide mask mandate, but most of the state’s 105 counties opted out. This week, Kelly and top Republicans agreed to try to persuade counties that are coronavirus hot spots to impose mask requirements rather than having the state step in. But she said she could still call the Republican-controlled Legislature into special session to impose a statewide rule.

Counties without mask mandates have seen the seven-day rolling average of daily cases per 100,000 steadily increase. And in September, those counties started to have higher case rates compared to counties with a mask mandate, Ginther said.

“We found a 50% reduction in the spread of COVID-19 in counties that had a mask mandate compared to those without,” Ginther said.

NEW YORK CITY — The coronavirus can spread more extensively in households than previous research suggests, and kids can transmit it at about the same rate as adults do, according to a new study.

The study shows how important it is for people who test positive to isolate themselves within a home, and for them and everyone else to wear masks when they are in common areas, researchers said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the study Friday. The researchers focused on 101 households in Tennessee and Wisconsin.

In each home, after a person was diagnosed, other household members agreed to undergo nasal swab or saliva tests and kept symptom diaries. Nearly 300 people participated. About 100 were identified as the first to be infected and the other 200 people lived with them.

About 53% of the household members tested positive, and most were diagnosed within five days of the time the first person got sick. Previous studies have estimated the secondary infection rate at around half that.

SAO PAULO — Four tourists were arrested on Thursday in Brazil for allegedly falsifying COVID-19 tests in an attempt to reach what some say is the world’s most beautiful beach.

The two men and two women were arrested after landing in Fernando de Noronha, a group of islands offshore northern Brazil, according to a statement posted on the archipelago’s official website. The Brazilians, who took a private jet and arrived Wednesday night, were accused of falsifying documents, using falsified documents and criminal association.

TripAdvisor users rated Fernando de Noronha’s Sancho Bay as the world’s top beach in 2020.

Fernando de Noronha reopened to tourists on Oct. 10, requiring COVID-19 tests that show negative results and administered no earlier than one day before departure. The visitors presented test results that were dated three days prior to their arrival.

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — South Dakota broke its record for new coronavirus infections reported in one day on Friday as 1,560 people tested positive.

SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco will temporarily halt the reopening of additional activities and businesses planned for next week because of an increase in coronavirus case rates and hospitalizations, the city’s mayor and health director said Friday.

That includes expanding capacity for indoor dining at restaurants, and at places of worship and museums among other businesses, as cases increase not just in San Francisco but also in California and nationally, said Mayor London Breed and Director of Public Health Dr. Grant Colfax.

San Francisco’s case rate has gone from 3 people per 100,000 to 4 people per 100,000 in the last two weeks, Colfax said, a 25% increase.

“We are still in the midst of a pandemic,” Breed said. “We are tired of COVID-19 but COVID-19 isn’t tired of us.”

The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo reduced the maximum number of people allowed at casual social gatherings from 15 to 10, barred spectators from youth sporting events, closed indoor sports facilities, and ordered businesses to remind customers to wear masks in an effort to stem a rising wave of new coronavirus cases.

The restrictions were announced Friday, on a day when the state Department of Health reported another 482 confirmed cases, and a daily test positivity rate of 3.3%.

She said state data is clear that the spread is being fueled by small, unstructured social gatherings where people let their guard down and stop wearing masks, and not in structured settings such as workplaces and schools. So she told residents to limit their social network to the same 10 people and avoid all nonessential activities, including parties, barbecues, baby showers and similar gatherings.

The goal of the new regulations is to disrupt schools and commerce as little as possible.

Hosts of parties and other gatherings that violate the 10-person limit are subject to a fine of $500 per guest over the limit. Spectators are banned from youth and school sports for two weeks. As of Monday, all skating rinks and indoor sports facilities will be required to close for one week while the state comes up with new safety protocols.

The rules around sports do not apply to colleges or pro teams.

When the government announced strict new lockdown measures Friday, the total number of deaths stood at 11,308, with 400,000 total cases — giving it one of the continent’s highest mortality rates. Only much-larger France, Spain, the U.K. and Italy have had more people die from the virus, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Hospitals at risk of collapse

On Oct. 24, Rudi Vervoort, the head of the country’s capital region, warned of “runaway” infection rates.

“A major issue is the risk of the collapse of the hospital system of our country,” he said.

While Belgium is relatively well-served with intensive care unit beds, with 2,000 available in a country of less than 12 million, more than half of those spaces were occupied by Covid-19 patients by Friday, according to the government agency Sciensano. In addition, the number of patients in ICU is not spread evenly across the country, and hospitals are already being overrun in some parts of the country.

In Liège, for example, the situation is “catastrophic,” said Philippe Devos, president of the Belgian Association of Medical Unions and an intensive care doctor at the CHC MontLégia hospital in the city.

On Oct. 25, he told national broadcaster RTBF that between one-fifth and one-quarter of medical staff were sick or quarantining, but he added that “positive cases would be asked to go back to work if they are asymptomatic.”

For their part, hospital staff called on the federal government for emergency reinforcements. They protested outside the clinic on Thursday.

“The distress is palpable — workers can no longer take it. Every day, we are contacted by colleagues at the end of their rope. Where are the promised reinforcements?” said the workers union, CNE, in a statement.

Internal strife

Belgium is mired in administrative and political crises — all of which have impacted its response to the pandemic.

Until the beginning of October, the country had not been able to form a federal government for 592 days — around 19 months. Longstanding linguistic and cultural divisions — northern, Dutch-speaking Flanders; southern, French-speaking Wallonia; and a sizable German-speaking area in the east — fuel these issues.

During the first wave of Covid-19 in the spring, it was the wealthier, northern region of Flanders that bore the brunt of the pandemic. Many blamed the surge on tourists returning from skiing in the Italian Alps. But as the pandemic spread across the country, a caretaker government implemented a strict lockdown that saw the disease reduced along similar lines seen elsewhere in Europe.

Regional differences and divisions have a tangible impact on the ground, according to Marc Botenga, a Belgian member of the European Parliament. But even more than the differences between the regions, organizational problems have dogged the country’s approach to the crisis.

At first, for example, nine ministers were tasked with running the health system, he said.

“Having nine ministers in charge means no one is really in charge or no one is really responsible,” Botenga said.

“Divisions have been a problem from the beginning,” he added. “It makes no sense because the virus does not stop at the linguistic border.”

So while the pandemic appeared under control to the outside world during the summer, this was actually a time marred by tensions between regions. In August, mayors of seaside towns threatened to close them to “outsiders” aftera brawl erupted on a Belgian beach. Some members of the right-wing Flemish separatist party Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie — the New Flemish Alliance — even called for trains to stop traveling to the coast from other parts of the country.

By October, Covid-19 cases were rising everywhere.

Conflicting guidance, poor rollout

When national measures were announced on Oct. 16, they included a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew throughout Belgium, and the closure of the bar, restaurants and hotel sectors. Brussels and Wallonia went further, imposing a new 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and shutting gyms, museums and other cultural centers.

But Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon resisted calls for tougher measures in Flanders, saying he wouldn’t “hose down his house in case it might catch fire next week.”

Virologist Marc Van Ranst described Jambon’s position as “incomprehensible.”

On Oct. 28, Jambon said rules would be tightened and Flanders closed gyms and cultural centers. But it maintained different curfew hours.

This patchwork of measures breeds confusion, said Anthony Zacharzewski, president of the Democractic Society, a Brussels-based nongovernmental organization.

”Single simple messages always work best,” he said. “Belgium’s different regions and communities have set different rules at different times and haven’t coordinated main messages, to such an extent that even the closest follower of the news isn’t sure what rules are in force where.”

Another major failure has been the lack of an effective track-and-trace system, according to Pieter Cleppe, research fellow at think tank Property Rights Alliance.

“Belgium's federal government did a good job expanding the country’s testing capacity, even if labs could no longer follow a few weeks ago, which some have blamed the government for,” he said. “In any case, testing is not of much use when it isn't followed up by contact tracing.”

What’s next?

On Friday, Belgium unveiled tighter restrictions on social contacts and a six-week closure of businesses like hairdressers and shops that provide nonessential services. It also extended a November school break by a week.

Belgium's numbers may be the worst on the continent, but across Europe fresh lockdowns were also announced over the last several days. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed parliament last Thursday warning of a long hard winter, implementing a partial lockdown through November 30. In France, where deaths from the virus are climbing to levels not seen since spring,President Emmanuel Macron closed non essential business, cafes and bars, but kept schools open and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced the closure of restaurants, theaters, and museums and imposed a nationwide evening curfew.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said the country of 11 million people otherwise faced a breakdown of its health system if they did not implement the measures, which fell just short of a full lockdown.

""We are moving in the direction of reinforced confinement with a single objective: to prevent health care from creaking under pressure that is already immense today,"" de Croo told a news conference.

""These are the last-chance measures.""

13-year-old Missouri boy dies from Covid-19 complications,"An eighth grade Missouri boy died over the weekend of Covid-19 complications, becoming the state's, and one of the nation's, youngest deaths from the coronavirus.

In a statement, Dr. Lori VanLeer, superintendent of Missouri's Washington School District, said that the Baumgarth family confirmed their 13-year-old son Peyton had passed away from complications of the virus.

VanLeer said Peyton died less than two weeks after he last attended class.

The boy's last day of eighth grade was on October 22. He began a quarantine on October 26.

Within a week, his symptoms worsened. Baumgarth was hospitalized and over the weekend succumbed to complications of Covid-19, his family told the school district.

""The family also asks that we all remember to wear masks, wash hands frequently and follow guidelines,"" the statement said. ""COVID-19 is real and they want to remind students and parents to take these precautions in and outside of school.""

The school said it would provide counselors for children when they returned to in-person class on Wednesday, and asked for the community's ""thoughts and prayers.""

"Prince William tested positive for coronavirus in April, British media reports","LONDON — Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, who is second in line to the British throne, tested positive for the coronavirus in April, British media reported Sunday.

Reached by NBC News on Sunday night, Kensington Palace, the prince's official residence, did not confirm or deny the reports. The Sun, a British tabloid, first reported the diagnosis, citing an unnamed Kensington Palace source.

Unlike his father, Prince Charles, who announced a positive Covid-19 test in March, William, 38, kept his diagnosis secret. It wasn't immediately clear how serious his condition was.

April was also when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that he'd been hospitalized in an intensive care unit after having tested positive for the virus.

Johnson later revealed that his infection was so serious that he'd needed ""liters and liters of oxygen"" to stay alive. Doctors were preparing to announce his death, he said.

Johnson announced a new monthlong lockdown Saturday as the number of cases in the country topped 1 million.

""Unless we act, we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day,"" he said.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The country enacted a three-month lockdown this year, but the number of cases began to rise as restrictions were eased.

Under the new rules, nonessential businesses must close, and bars and restaurants can offer only takeout. Schools, universities and construction sites will be allowed to remain open.

More than half the country has issued mask requirements. See if there's a mandate in your state.,"In the age of COVID-19, the act of wearing a mask in public has become another front in America’s bitter culture wars. But even amid the partisan divide, a growing number of states — including some led by Republican governors — are now mandating face coverings.

More than half the states had issued mask requirements as of October 30, a move that public health experts say will help stop the spread of the coronavirus as cases surge in many regions.

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who had resisted a statewide mask requirement, issued one in July, as did Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat.

But some political squabbles show no sign of abating: Georgia's governor in July sued Atlanta's mayor over the city's mask law, a day after he banned local governments from requiring the coverings.

Between July and late October, several new states issued mask mandates, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont, Indiana and Ohio.

England faces new lockdown as UK virus cases pass 1 million,"LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday announced a new monthlong lockdown for England after being warned that without tough action a resurgent coronavirus outbreak will overwhelm hospitals in weeks.

On the day the U.K. passed 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, Johnson made a sudden about-face and confirmed that stringent restrictions on business and daily life would begin Thursday and last until Dec. 2.

He said at a televised news conference that “no responsible prime minister” could ignore the grim figures.

“Unless we act, we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day,” said Johnson, who was hospitalized earlier this year for a serious case of Covid-19.

Under the new restrictions, bars and restaurants can only offer takeout, nonessential shops must close and people will only be able to leave home for a short list of reasons including exercise. Activities ranging from haircuts to foreign holidays must once again be put on hold.

Unlike during the U.K.’s first three-month lockdown earlier this year, schools, universities, construction sites and manufacturing businesses will stay open.

As in other European countries, virus cases in the U.K. began to climb after lockdown measures were eased in the summer and people began to return to workplaces, schools, universities and social life.

Johnson had hoped a set of regional restrictions introduced earlier in October would be enough to push numbers down. But government scientific advisers predict that on the outbreak’s current trajectory, demand for hospital beds will exceed capacity by the first week of December, even if temporary hospitals set up during the first peak of the virus are reopened.

Johnson came under mounting pressure to act as scientists warned Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths in the U.K. could soon surpass the levels seen at the outbreak’s spring peak, when daily deaths topped 1,000. As European countries such as France, Germany and Belgium in imposing a second lockdown amid surging caseloads, it looked inevitable that Johnson would have to follow.

London School of Hygiene epidemiologist John Edmunds, a member of the government’s scientific advisory group, said Saturday that cases were running “significantly above” a reasonable worst-case scenario drawn up by modelers.

“It is really unthinkable now, unfortunately, that we don’t count our deaths in tens of thousands from this wave,” Edmunds told the BBC. “The issue is, is that going to be low tens of thousands if we take radical action now or is that going to be the high tens of thousands if we don’t?”

Official figures announced Saturday recorded 21,915 new cases confirmed in the last 24 hours, bringing Britain’s total since the start of the pandemic to 1,011,660. Britain’s death toll from the coronavirus is 46,555, the highest in Europe, with 326 new deaths announced Saturday.

The United States, India, Brazil, Russia, France, Spain, Argentina and Colombia have also recorded more than 1 million cases, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Scientists say the true number of cases is much higher because not everyone with the virus is tested.

The new measures apply to England. Other parts of the U.K. set their own public health measures, with Wales and Northern Ireland already effectively in lockdown and Scotland under a set of tough regional restrictions.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Saturday that for now people in Scotland should not travel to or from England, “except for essential purposes.”

Lucy Powell, business spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, accused the government of “dithering” and said the country was now facing a longer lockdown than if Johnson had acted sooner.

But Johnson is also under pressure from some members of his Conservative Party, who oppose tighter restrictions because of the economic damage they cause. Any new lockdown will need Parliament’s approval in a vote scheduled for Wednesday.

Owners of businesses that have struggled to get back on their feet since the first lockdown was eased said the impact of new closures would be devastating.

“People have borrowed up to the hilt and spent money in order to get Covid-secure,” said Kate Nicholls of pub and restaurant industry group Hospitality U.K. “There is no spare capacity in the tank to be able to fund a lockdown, even for three to four weeks.”

A government program that has paid the wages of millions of furloughed employees during the pandemic was due to end Saturday, but will be extended during the new lockdown.

Johnson had planned to announce the lockdown in Parliament on Monday, but was forced into early action after the Times of London reported the news. The government said there would be an investigation into the leak.

The U.K. is recording more than 20,000 new coronavirus infections a day, and government statisticians say the true figure is far higher. The Office for National Statistics estimated Friday that 1 in 100 people in England, well over half a million, had the virus in the week to Oct. 23.

Jeremy Farrar, director of medical research charity the Wellcome Trust and a government adviser, said swift action would avoid many more deaths.

“The best time to act was a month ago but these are very tough decisions which we would all like to avoid,” he tweeted. “The second-best time is now.”",2020-10-31 20:32:00+00:00,
CDC report shows how a Wisconsin summer retreat became a 'superspreading' event,"A coronavirus outbreak raged through an overnight school retreat in Wisconsin during the summer, beginning with one student before ultimately infecting more than 90 percent of the teens and the counselors, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The six-week faith-based camp had required all attendees from 23 states and territories and two foreign countries to be tested and quarantined for the week prior to the retreat, which ran from July 2 to Aug. 11. However, shortly after arriving at the camp, a ninth grader who had tested negative for the virus at home developed symptoms including a sore throat, cough and chills. The student was then given a PCR test which came back positive, the CDC reported.

Excluding 24 attendees who had provided evidence through antibody testing of having already been infected with and recovered from the virus, 91 percent, or 116, of the 128 students who had not previously been infected with the virus were determined to have Covid-19 either with a positive PCR test or a diagnosis based on symptoms.

Although the boys, all of high school age, were required to wear masks when traveling to the camp, they were allowed to go without them once they arrived and to mingle freely. The students and 21 counselors slept in close quarters: the students living four to six per room in dormitories or eight per room in yurts, and the counselors staying together in dormitories and yurts.

After the ninth grader tested positive, he was quarantined with 11 of his close contacts. After the 11 contacts tested negative by rapid antigen tests, they were released from quarantine. However, during the first week of the camp, six of the 11, as well as 18 others, reported a new onset of mild symptoms. These students were given masks, but not isolated, and there was no contact tracing, the researchers wrote.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services was notified of the outbreak July 15, and on July 28, the department tested 148 of the 152 retreat attendees. Antibody tests showed that91 percent of those who had not been infected prior to arriving at the camp, 116 out of 128, had developed an infection while there.

None of the teachers, who were quartered separately from the students and the counselors and wore masks during class and practiced social distancing at all times, tested positive for the disease.

All the illnesses were mild and there were no deaths or hospitalizations reported among those who caught the virus.

“The attack rate was extraordinary both in terms of the number infected, as well as the pace at which they were infected,” Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, said.“It illustrates how hard it has been to control,"" he said.

Given that the students and the counselors were allowed to mix freely and were not required to wear masks or practice social distancing, an outbreak wasn't surprising, Dr. Waleed Javaid, director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York, said.

“This goes to show that a negative test does not mean we should not social distance,” Javaid said. “At certain points, especially early on in the infection, the test may be negative and does not automatically indicate that a person is infection-free. We need to wear a mask and maintain social distancing in public gatherings.”",2020-10-29 21:29:00+00:00,
Scientists debate how much to lower the bar on Covid-19 vaccine potential,"The White House and many Americans have pinned their hopes for defeating the Covid-19 pandemic on a vaccine's being developed at ""warp speed."" But some scientific experts warn they're all expecting too much, too soon.

""Everyone thinks Covid-19 will go away with a vaccine,"" said William Haseltine, chair and president of Access Health International, a foundation that advocates for affordable care.

Ongoing clinical trials are primarily designed to show whether Covid-19 vaccine candidates prevent any symptoms of the disease — which could be as minor as a sore throat or a cough. But the trials, which will study 30,000 to 60,000 volunteers, will be too brief and too small to prove that the vaccines will prevent what people fear most — being hospitalized or dying — by the time the first vaccine makers file for emergency use authorization, which is expected to occur later this year, Haseltine said.

The United States should hold out for an optimal vaccine, with more proven capabilities, Haseltine said. Others say the crushing toll of the pandemic — which has killed at least 225,000 people in the U.S. — demands that the country accept the best vaccine it can achieve within the next few months, even if significant questions remain after its release.

""There's a tension between getting every piece of information and getting a vaccine [out] in time to save lives,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Cancer.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Dr. Peter Lurie, a former Food and Drug Administration official who is president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said: ""Would we like to know if the vaccine reduces illness or mortality? Of course. But there is a real time pressure. This is a pandemic. It's explosive.""

Researchers debated how rigorously to test Covid-19 vaccine candidates at a public meeting Thursday of the FDA's advisory committee on vaccines.

""Simply preventing mild cases is not enough and may not justify the risks associated with vaccination,"" said Peter Doshi, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, who detailed his concerns in an editorial in The BMJ.

But vaccine experts say there are good reasons to focus on milder cases of Covid-19.

Vaccines that prevent mild disease typically prevent severe disease, as well, said Dr. Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health and temporary chair of the vaccine committee.

If you put out a small fire in the kitchen, you don't have to worry about the whole house catching fire.

For example, the original studies of the measles vaccine showed that it prevented only measles, not hospitalizations or deaths, said Dr. Kathleen Neuzil, director of the University of Maryland's Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health.

Later studies found that measles vaccines dramatically reduce mortality. According to the World Health Organization, worldwide deaths from measles fell by 73 percent from 2000 to 2018 because of vaccines.

""There simply does not exist an example in vaccinology of vaccines that are effective against mild disease that are not more effective in severe disease,"" Dr. Philip Krause, deputy director of the vaccine office at the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said at Thursday's hearing.

Dr. Paul Offit, who developed the rotavirus vaccine, compared preventing the coronavirus to fighting a fire.

""If you put out a small fire in the kitchen, you don't have to worry about the whole house catching fire,"" said Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee.

Proving that a vaccine prevents severe illness and death is harder than showing that it protects against mild illness, because hospitalizations and deaths are much rarer. That's especially true among the type of health-conscious people who volunteer for vaccine trials, who are probably more likely than others to wear masks and to socially distance, Schaffner said.

Neuzil said, ""When we looked at hospitalizations in older adults with influenza, those were two-year trials."" In an ongoing study in which ""we're looking at typhoid vaccines in nearly 30,000 children, it's a two-year trial.""

The Covid-19 pandemic has officially infected about 8.7 million people in the U.S. Considering that the true number of people who have been infected is estimated to be 6 to 10 times higher than reported, the mortality rate is about 0.6 percent, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.

Scientists agree that the ideal vaccine would provide ""sterilizing immunity"" — which means preventing not only disease symptoms but also any infection with the virus, said Dr. Corey Casper, a vaccinologist with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and CEO at the Infectious Disease Research Institute in Seattle.

For example, two doses of measles vaccines prevent 97 percent of people from even becoming infected with that virus.

Few expect Covid-19 vaccines to be that effective. ""We're trying to lower that bar and determine how much lower is acceptable,"" Casper said.

Preventing mild disease could curb disease and prevent illness, Casper said.

""We're probably not going to have the perfect vaccine,"" he said. ""But I do think we're likely to have vaccines that, if we can show they're safe, can put an inflection point on this pandemic. ... I think it's still important to have a vaccine that has some effect even on mild illness.""

Flu shots aren't super-effective — with effectiveness each year from 19 percent to 70 percent — but they're still extremely useful, Casper said.

During the 2018-19 U.S. flu season, vaccination prevented an estimated 4.4 million influenza illnesses, 2.3 million medical visits, 58,000 hospitalizations and 3,500 influenza-associated deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A trial of 30,000 to 60,000 people is already fairly large by historical standards. Dramatically expanding beyond that isn't practical in a compressed time frame, Krause said.

""If the endpoint of the trial is severe disease, the trials may need to be almost 10 times as big,"" he said at the meeting. ""And those trials would be infeasible, and we would never get a vaccine.""

On the other hand, ""if there is a vaccine that appears to have high efficacy or appears to be capable of saving lives, one doesn't want to stop that vaccine if there is a significant chance that it will save lives,"" Krause said.

Although the coronavirus vaccine trials are measuring severe disease or death, these are ""secondary endpoints,"" meaning the current study isn't large enough to produce a statistically significant answer, Neuzil said.

Whether vaccines reduce severe disease and death will become clear in later studies, after vaccines are distributed, she said.

Offit said the debate revolves around one question: ""How much uncertainty are we willing to live with, knowing that we're facing a virus that has brought us to our knees?""",2020-10-28 09:00:00+00:00,
Covid-19 pandemic may actually help ease seasonal affective disorder symptoms for some,"When the crickets start to hum in the late summer and families start back-to-school shopping, Michele Sheerman can sense her looming seasonal affective disorder, otherwise known as SAD.

But this season hasn’t been so bad.

As the coronavirus pandemic stretches into the fall and the winter, some people who cope with the disorder, a type of depression usually associated with shorter days and less sunlight, may experience milder symptoms, psychologists suggest.

Sheerman, 48, who dubs herself as a “lifelong SADie”, is one of them. She attributes her milder symptoms so far to the camaraderie and shared experience she has had amid the pandemic.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

“I don't feel as isolated because there are so many people in the same spot,” she said. “I am finding it less oppressive and less severe this year.”

Craig Sawchuk, a psychologist at the Mayo Clinic, said that depending on the individual, it’s possible for people with the disorder to have milder symptoms this season if they developed healthy routines as quarantine orders took effect, such as waking up at the same time every day, carving out time for relaxation and maintaining support systems.

“They've been forced earlier in the year to make some pretty big, but healthy changes and habits and daily rhythms and other things. And that may be protective going forward heading into the winter months,” he said.

Lata McGinn, a professor of psychology at Yeshiva University, agreed that it’s possible for people with the disorder to have lighter symptoms this season, but cautioned that they can also fare worse because of the pandemic. “You might be in good company on the one hand and you might be doing a little less than you normally do in the winter if you’re already vulnerable,” she said.

Scott Bea, a clinical psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic, agreed. “If folks have been taking steps to form great habits to eat well, move their bodies and connect with others, that would be good protection against depression,” he said.

Both psychologists said it’s possible that people with the seasonal affective disorder could fare better this season, but cautioned that may not be the case for everyone. “I don't think it will be necessarily unified,” Bea said.

John Anderson, 37, has had the disorder since his early 20s. Like Sheerman, his symptoms have eased up because of the pandemic.

“When you have seasonal depression, people don't always understand it, they don't understand what you're going through, or some people might not believe that it even exists,” he said. But this year, Anderson has had an easier time talking to people because, “we're all in the same boat right now.”

“Getting out in daylight is really a great thing,” Bea said. He recommends people with the disorder who have the flexibility to work from home to squeeze in some daylight throughout the day.

Connecting with people is one of the tips experts give to those dealing with the disorder. But that can be a challenge this year because your risk of getting Covid-19 increases with the more people you interact with at a gathering, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Because that recommendation conflicts with current public health recommendations, Bea says people with the disorder have to adapt and accept feeling uncomfortable.

“Try some new and novel things that we haven't tried before,” he said. For example, instead of calling them virtual gatherings, just call them gatherings, he advised. ""I would try to get away from thinking that the way we socialized is artificial, and just call it the real thing.""

Sawchuck also recommended using a light box that’s 10,000 lux in intensity — lux is a measure of brightness — getting enough sleep and maintaining structure throughout the day.

Anderson tends to overeat and shy away from people during the coldest months of winter. But this year, he’s taking extra steps to reach out to friends and not take them for granted. “You start to realize that, what if they're not here tomorrow.”",2020-10-28 09:00:00+00:00,
"Third wave of coronavirus infections in the U.S.? More like 'wildfire,' epidemiologist says","“I look at it more as an elongated exacerbation of the original first wave,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday at an annual event for Yahoo Finance. “It’s kind of semantics. You want to call it the third wave or an extended first wave, no matter how you look at it, it's not good news.”

Fauci and other experts are particularly concerned that the recent surge in cases is starting from a higher baseline of roughly 40,000 cases per day, compared with 20,000 cases per day during the summer surge.

“Each wave we start from a higher baseline and we start climbing,” Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health said, noting that during the summer, infections were rising most in the South and Southwest. ""This time, it's all around the country and we're heading into winter, where the virus becomes more efficient in spreading.""

Still, Jha said the terminology isn’t as important as Americans understanding that the growth of new cases can quickly become exponential.

""The metaphor of a wildfire is probably better,"" said William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""It's indisputable that the U.S. is now seeing a pretty widespread transmission across the board.""

Unlike a wave, which comes and passes through, wildfires can be patchy and more intense in areas, similar to the situation in the U.S., Hanage said. Community mitigation efforts such as masking and social distancing can stamp out the spread, but then infections tend to pop up in other areas with more relaxed measures.

Tara Smith, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at Kent State University in Ohio, is not a fan of the wave terminology. “That implies there's a trough, and our cases have never really declined that significantly,” she said.

Small gatherings are now playing a larger role in driving transmission, Smith said, and can be tied to the fatigue from a pandemic nearing its eighth month.

“Everyone wants to feel a bit of normalcy, even if for an evening,” she said.

As the U.S. heads into the winter holiday months, doubling-down on basic public health measures is even more crucial, especially wearing a mask and avoiding crowds and close contact in closed spaces with poor ventilation, experts say.

“When you're dealing with the first full winter of the worst pandemic that we have seen in a century, the capacity for chaos is there and is real,"" Hanage said. ""The virus likes chaos.""",2020-10-26 23:56:00+00:00,
Map: Coronavirus travel restrictions by state,"Guidance on traveling and travel restrictions varies across the U.S. This patchwork of restrictions highlights the ability of states to take different approaches while making their way through the coronavirus pandemic.

While all of the Northeast and most of the mid-Atlantic states have implemented statewide travel restrictions, more than half the states, including two of the biggest, California and Texas, have no such restrictions.

States hit the hardest when the epidemic began in the United States in the early spring, such as New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have the toughest travel restrictions.

As of Oct. 26, any traveler from the more than 40 states and territories currently on the tri-state’s advisory list must self-quarantine for 14 days. States will appear on the advisory list if they have new daily positive test rates higher than 10 per 100,000 residents or are states with a 10 percent or higher positivity rate over a seven-day rolling average.

GENEVA — On a cold weekend in mid-February, when the world still harbored false hope that the new coronavirus could be contained, a World Health Organization team arrived in Beijing to study the outbreak and investigate a critical question: How did the virus jump from animals to humans?

At that point, there were only three confirmed deaths from Covid-19 outside China and scientists hoped that finding an animal source for the coronavirus would unlock clues about how to stop it, treat it and prevent similar outbreaks.

“If we don’t know the source then we’re equally vulnerable in the future to a similar outbreak,” Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergency director, had said that week in Geneva. “Understanding that source is a very important next step.”

What the team members did not know was that they would not be allowed to investigate the source at all. Despite Dr. Ryan’s pronouncements, and over the advice of its emergency committee, the organization’s leadership had quietly negotiated terms that sidelined its own experts. They would not question China’s initial response or even visit the live-animal market in the city of Wuhan where the outbreak seemed to have originated.",11/2/20 0:00,

Video Germany entered a new partial lockdown on Monday amid skyrocketing coronavirus cases across Europe. Credit Credit... Filip Singer/EPA, via Shutterstock Germany entered a new partial lockdown on Monday amid skyrocketing coronavirus cases across Europe, a specter that Chancellor Angela Merkel called a test not seen in her country since the end of World War II. Under the new rules, labeled “lockdown light” by the German media, restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close for a month. The policy is designed to bring Germany’s per capita rate of new cases below 50 per 100,000 residents, from 128, so that health authorities can once again trace individual infections. Ms. Merkel will meet with state governors in two weeks to gauge progress, and promised that if all goes well, Germans would be able to “allow ourselves more freedom at Christmas,” though wild New Year’s parties remain unimaginable. Germany is still recording far fewer cases per capita than many other European nations, but there are grave fears that the second wave of infections could prove even more difficult than the spring. Ms. Merkel pushed back against criticism of her government’s decision to focus on curtailing social life, saying it was the only way to keep schools and shops open, while still cutting back on interactions. “Freedom is the possibility to decide from various options, but freedom is also freedom for everyone,” Ms. Merkel said. “That means, I don’t have endless freedom and everyone else has to live with my version of freedom.” Europe as a whole surpassed 10 million confirmed cases and 268,000 Covid-19 deaths on Sunday, as many countries imposed tough new restrictions. France began a national lockdown on Sunday, and Britain is set to enter one on Thursday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain laid out his lockdown plan before Parliament on Monday, and faced a mutiny from members of his Conservative Party, who said he went too far, and scalding criticism from Labour Party leaders, who said he waited too long to act. The measure is expected to be approved when it comes up for a vote on Wednesday. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told lawmakers on Monday that restrictions there would be tightened, but that there would not be a national lockdown. Some measures, though, will apply throughout the country, including a nighttime curfew and limiting travel between high-risk areas. Other restrictions would be applied depending on the perceived risk level in a specific territory. “We are aware of the frustration, sense of disorientation and exhaustion on the part of citizens, as well as the anger that has been manifesting itself in recent days,” Mr. Conte said, a reference to the sporadic protests in various cities. He also acknowledged the significant impact that past restrictions have had on the national economy, adding that the government had sought to alleviate the hardships with aid. Greece on Monday announced a full lockdown in the country’s second-largest city, Thessaloniki, and of the region of Serres, also in northern Greece. A government spokesman described the situation in those regions as “extremely serious,” as he announced the new measures, which go into effect on Tuesday for two weeks. The restrictions include an overnight curfew and the reinstatement of a system requiring people to send a text message to the Greek government citing their reasons for venturing out — for work and health reasons only. All flights to and from Thessaloniki will be suspended. Schools will remain open. The announcement came after Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Saturday heralded a new set of restrictions nationwide that are set to go into effect on Tuesday morning. Portugal, which marked a day of mourning for virus victims on Monday, is set to reintroduce a partial lockdown that will affect about 70 percent of its population, including inhabitants of Lisbon and Porto, the two largest cities, The Associated Press reported. Kosovo on Monday also imposed new measures to prevent a collapse of its hospital capacity. — Christopher F. Schuetze, Niki Kitsantonis, Elisabetta Povoledo, Karen Zraick and

The tension grows between the Trump administration and Fauci, one of its top scientists. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 0:59 - 0:00 transcript Supporters Chant ‘Fire Fauci’ at Florida Trump Rally At a late-night rally in Florida, President Trump suggested that he might fire Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, but that he would wait until “after the election.” “But we’re going to have a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic. Without it, it’s rounding the turn. I say, it drives them crazy — it’s rounding the turn. Because all they want to do, you turn on the news, ‘Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid Covid.’ ‘We’d like to talk about Covid, and then next on —’ Here’s what happens: Nov. 4, you won’t hear too much about it. You won’t hear too much about it.” Crowd: “Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci!” “Don’t tell anybody — but let me wait till a little bit after the election, please. [cheering] I appreciate the advice. I appreciate the advice. Nah, he’s been wrong on a lot. He’s a nice man, though he’s been wrong on a lot.” At a late-night rally in Florida, President Trump suggested that he might fire Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, but that he would wait until “after the election.” Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President Trump suggested at a rally early Monday morning that he might fire Dr. Anthony S. Fauci after Election Day, further escalating the tension between his administration and the nation’s top infectious disease expert as the number of new coronavirus cases in the United States reaches record highs. Mr. Trump spoke well past midnight at the Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport in Florida at his fifth and final rally on Sunday. At one point, he began reciting a familiar complaint about the news media’s continued coverage of the virus. His grousing led the crowd to chant, “Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci!” Mr. Trump listened in silence for a few moments before remarking: “Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice.” Dr. Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has civil service protections, and it would be extremely difficult for the president to have him removed. Under federal law, the president does not have authority to fire Dr. Fauci. Mr. Trump could try ordering his political appointees, such as Health Secretary Alex M. Azar II or Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, to dismiss Dr. Fauci. But the process would be lengthy and arduous, because Dr. Fauci could appeal. Dr. Fauci has run his institute since 1984; in years past, when he has been mentioned as a possible candidate for director of the N.I.H., he has demurred because that position is a political appointee, and he did not want his job to be tied to any president’s term. The president’s remarks came toward the end of what was a whirlwind day of campaigning across five states — Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida — and he spoke even as a local curfew aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus took effect at midnight. According to a New York Times database, the country set records on Sunday for the average number of new virus cases over a seven-day period — more than 82,000 daily — and the total number of new cases over the same amount of time — more than 579,000 cases. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump has maintained without citing evidence that the United States has “turned the corner” in fighting the virus, a point he reiterated at the rally early Monday. That assertion is strongly disputed by Dr. Fauci, who told the The Washington Post in an interview published on Saturday that the United States “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” as it heads into the winter. A White House spokesman later called Dr. Fauci’s comments “unacceptable.” Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, has said repeatedly that if he were to win the presidency, he is hopeful Dr. Fauci would remain in his role and serve in his administration. In his interview with The Post, Dr. Fauci offered praise for the Biden campaign, saying it was taking the coronavirus “seriously from a public health perspective.” Ordinarily circumspect, Dr. Fauci also took the opportunity to unload on another Trump pandemic adviser, Dr. Scott W. Atlas, who has won the president’s favor by questioning mask use and espousing a number of other contrarian views. “I have real problems with that guy,” Dr. Fauci said, suggesting that Dr. Atlas, a neuroradiologist with no background in infectious disease, is out of his depth. Dr. Atlas, on Saturday, appeared on RT, a Russian state-sponsored television network that has helped Moscow spread false health information about the pandemic. American intelligence agencies consider RT a propaganda arm for Russia, and it is registered in the United States as a foreign agent. “The lockdowns will go down as an epic failure of public policy by people who refuse to accept they were wrong,” Dr. Atlas said in the interview. “The argument is undeniable, the lockdowns are killing people.” The interview with RT was not approved by the White House press office, an administration official said, and Dr. Atlas apologized for giving it. “I regret doing the interview and apologize for allowing myself to be taken advantage of,” he said in a tweet. “I especially apologize to the national security community who is working hard to defend us.” The White House has had no public criticism of Dr. Atlas, though it did for Dr. Fauci. In a statement to The Post, a White House spokesman, Judd Deere, said it was “unacceptable and breaking with all norms” for Dr. Fauci to “play politics” three days before the election. Dr. Fauci, he said, had made “his political leanings known by praising the president’s opponent, exactly what the American people have come to expect from the swamp.” — Matt Stevens, Sheryl Gay Stolberg and

Naohiko Hatta/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images On a cold weekend in mid-February, when the world still harbored hope that the coronavirus could be contained, a World Health Organization team arrived in Beijing to study the outbreak and investigate a critical question: How did the virus jump from animals to humans? At that point, there were only three confirmed deaths from Covid-19 outside China, and scientists hoped that finding an animal source for the virus would unlock clues about how to stop it, treat it and prevent similar outbreaks. “If we don’t know the source, then we’re equally vulnerable in the future to a similar outbreak,” Dr. Michael Ryan, the emergency director of the W.H.O., had said that week.

They would not question China’s initial response or even visit the live-animal market in the city of Wuhan where the outbreak seemed to have originated. Nine months and more than 1.1 million deaths later, there is still no transparent, independent investigation into the source of the virus. China has impeded the effort, while leaders of the W.H.O., if privately frustrated, have largely ceded control, even as the Trump administration has fumed. From the earliest days of the outbreak, the W.H.O. — the only public health body with a global remit — has been both indispensable and impotent. The Geneva-based agency has delivered key information about testing, treatment and vaccine science. When the Trump administration decided to develop its own test kits, rather than rely on the W.H.O. blueprint, the botched result led to delays. At the same time, the health organization pushed misleading and contradictory information about the risk of spread from symptomless carriers. Its experts were slow to accept that the virus could be airborne. Top health officials encouraged travel as usual, advice that was based on politics and economics, not science. The W.H.O.’s staunchest defenders note that, by the nature of its constitution, it is beholden to the countries that finance it. And it is hardly the only international body bending to China’s might. Now, as a new Covid-19 wave engulfs Europe and the United States, the organization is in the middle of a geopolitical standoff between the world’s two greatest powers, the United States and China. China’s authoritarian leaders want to constrain the organization; President Trump, who formally withdrew the United States from the body in July, seems intent on destroying it; and European leaders are scrambling to reform and empower it. — Selam Gebrekidan, Matt Apuzzo, Amy Qin and

In people without symptoms, a rapid test misses more infections than it spots, a study says. A study found that the Sofia rapid test detected 80 percent of infections in symptomatic people, but the results were poor when the test was given to people without symptoms. Credit... Quidel Corporation A new study casts doubt on whether rapid coronavirus tests, widely hailed as a potential solution to the nation’s testing woes, perform as promised under real-world conditions, especially when used in people without symptoms. In a head-to-head comparison, researchers at the University of Arizona found that, in symptomatic people, a rapid test made by Quidel could detect more than 80 percent of coronavirus infections found by a slower, lab-based P.C.R. test. But when the rapid test, called the Sofia, was used instead to randomly screen students and staff members who did not feel sick, it detected only 32 percent of the positive cases identified by the P.C.R. test. “That’s worse than flipping a coin,” said Jennifer Dien Bard, the director of the clinical microbiology and virology laboratory at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study. When asked about the Sofia’s poorer performance in asymptomatic people, David Harris, an author on the study, said, “I think everybody expected that.” But he and his colleagues argued in their manuscript that some of the asymptomatic people who tested positive with P.C.R., but negative with the rapid test, might have been missed for good reason: They were carrying too little of the coronavirus to spread it to others, based on data obtained by P.C.R. Doug Bryant, Quidel’s president and chief executive, who received an early copy of the University of Arizona study, praised the results as “very, very good,” citing the Sofia’s ability to root out “people who are infectious.” Other experts advised caution, however, noting that there is no definitive test for infectiousness. For now, people with symptoms or known exposures to the coronavirus should still get the most precise and reliable tests available — those that use P.C.R., said Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California who was not involved in the study. More data, she added, would be needed to figure out how rapid tests fit into the larger diagnostic landscape. —

N.Y.C parents must decide — in two weeks — whether to send children to school. The choice to send children to school in person is particularly fraught in N.Y.C., once a global epicenter of the virus and now one of the few large urban districts in the United States to offer any classroom instruction. Credit... Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters Over the next two weeks, more than one million parents in New York City must make a wrenching decision: Should they send their children into classrooms this school year or keep them learning from home, likely until at least next fall? Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that parents would have until Nov. 15 to decide whether to enroll their children in hybrid learning, a mixture of in-person and remote instruction, for the remainder of the school year. The city had originally promised parents they could opt into the hybrid program every few months. But the mayor changed the rules because about only a quarter of the district’s 1.1 million students have shown up for in-person classes since September, far fewer than predicted. That has made it difficult for the city to know how to allocate teachers, the mayor said. Now, the many parents who have kept their children home, whether for safety, convenience or consistency, need to decide: Is hybrid learning working? It is a question parents in many other places across the country and world are also facing, as more districts prepare to open for at least some mixture of in-person and remote classes. But the choice is particularly fraught in New York City, once a global epicenter of the virus and now one of the few large urban districts in the United States to offer any classroom instruction. “Intuitively, parents understand that the best place for kids is in school,” said Eric Goldberg, an elected parent leader in Manhattan who has chosen hybrid learning for his own children. “But what is it about the New York City public school experience that is leading families to choose remote learning? When the in-school experience is so compromised and inferior, people think, ‘Why am I doing this?’” On Monday, Mr. Bill de Blasio said that the citywide seven-day rolling average virus positivity rate was 1.81 percent, and that the city wanted to start “knocking down” that figure. “We’re keeping a very close eye on the situation,” he said. “We’re obviously at a point where that has gone up in recent weeks and we take that very seriously.” The mayor has said he will require all students to take all their classes remotely if the seven-day rolling average reaches 3 percent. — Eliza Shapiro and

CRITIC’S NOTEBOOK Outdoor dining in N.Y.C. is here to stay. How will it change the city? Restaurants prepare for winter dining in Astoria, Queens. Credit... John Taggart for The New York Times Covid-19 has changed New York City’s restaurant culture more than any event since Prohibition. The most obvious effect will be the death of hundreds and possibly thousands of small, independent businesses, each loss radiating out to employees, communities and suppliers. The crisis is so immediate and overwhelming that it is hard to imagine what life will be like after it’s over. But when the pandemic is under control and restrictions on dining have been lifted, at least one emergency measure will remain. The outdoor dining program that allowed more than 10,000 restaurants to set out tables and chairs on the city’s sidewalks and streets is here to stay, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council. In the general calamity, it has been easy to overlook the enormous implications this move will have: The line between restaurant food and street food will disappear, street music will become as deeply woven into street life in New York as it is in New Orleans, and now that we have gotten used to enjoying dinner and a cocktail on a patch of blacktop that would otherwise be taken up by a RAV4, we might begin to wonder what else could sit in the street. The stripped-down approval process that allows restaurants to set up sidewalk and street seating has turned out to be more fair than the former system. The whole city has benefited by encouraging restaurants, from the most well-off to the leanest and scrappiest, to lend their own flavor to public spaces. Our economy is struggling, but our street culture, after decades of changes that made it more boring, is interesting again. —

OK LA MS AL GA HI TX FL As rapid coronavirus tests are becoming more widely available, delivering results in minutes, officials warn of a significant undercount, blurring the virus’s spread in the United States and in communities where such tests are more commonly used. Public health officials say that antigen tests, which are faster than polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.) tests but less able to detect low levels of the virus, are an important tool for limiting the spread of the virus. But they caution that with inconsistent public reporting, the case undercount may worsen as more “point-of-care” antigen tests, as well as D.I.Y. and home test kits, come on the market. “We want to be sure that we’re not now saying, ‘there’s no disease,’ when there is lots of disease. All that’s happened is that the science with which we identify it has evolved,” said Janet Hamilton, the executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, the group that helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define cases of the coronavirus. Despite C.D.C. guidance to report cases based on P.C.R. and antigen testing, Washington, D.C., and seven states don’t publicly share case counts for those with antigen positive tests, including California, New Jersey and Texas. Another six states keep these tallies separate from their total counts, and most of these report them less frequently. The differences among states are in part because of each state’s comfort level with the rapid tests, which aren’t “confirmatory” like P.C.R. tests because they can miss low levels of the virus. Yet most states treat antigen positive cases or “probable” cases the same as “confirmed” cases, by following up with interviews and contact tracing. And a growing number of states, including New Mexico, Oregon and Utah, include individuals with positive antigen tests in their total confirmed case counts. Scientists who follow the development of coronavirus tests say that rapid testing capacity — most of it antigen-based — could reach 200 million tests a month by early next year, and help the country reach recommended testing levels. — Amy Schoenfeld Walker, Lisa Waananen Jones and

Tests show the genetic signature of the virus that may have infected Trump. President Trump’s announcement of his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, in late September, may have been a super-spreader event. Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times President Trump’s illness from a coronavirus infection last month was the most significant health crisis for a sitting president in nearly 40 years. Yet little remains known about how the virus arrived at the White House and how it spread. The administration did not take basic steps to track the outbreak, limiting contact tracing, keeping cases a secret and cutting out the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One standard public health technique may still shed some light: tracking the cluster’s genetic fingerprints. To better understand the outbreak, The New York Times worked with geneticists to determine the genetic sequence of viruses that infected two Times journalists believed to have been exposed as part of their work covering the White House. The study reveals, for the first time, the genetic sequence of the virus that may have infected Mr. Trump and dozens of others, researchers said. That genome is a crucial clue that may allow researchers to identify where the outbreak originated and whether it went on to infect others across the country. Additional sequencing could help establish the path of the virus through the White House, the role of a possible super-spreading event for Judge Amy Coney Barrett and the origin of an outbreak among the staff of Vice President Mike Pence. The journalists, Michael D. Shear and Al Drago, both had significant, separate exposure to White House officials in late September, several days before they developed symptoms. They did not spend any time near each other in the weeks before their positive tests. The viral genomes of the two journalists shared the same distinct pattern of mutations, the research found. The findings suggest that they were infected as part of the broader White House outbreak, said Trevor Bedford, a geneticist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington who led the research team. The study, which has been posted online but not yet peer reviewed or published in a science journal, followed academic protocols that require genetic samples to be anonymous. Mr. Shear and Mr. Drago chose to disclose their identities for this article. —

Boxes of pasta for vulnerable families are prepared at the Cooking Champions food bank in Grange Park, London, on October 27. Credit... Tolga Akmen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The English soccer star Marcus Rashford launched a campaign earlier this year to provide free meals to children who need them, an effort that emerged after widespread disapproval of the way Prime Minister Boris Johnson was handling the impact of the pandemic. England is expected to go back into lockdown again on Thursday in an effort to contain the spread of the virus, and only essential shops will remain open, putting many families under economic strain. Despite this, the government has refused to extend a free school lunch program for eligible students to cover fall break and the school vacations at Christmas and Easter. During the first lockdown, Mr. Rashford, a 23-year-old forward on Manchester United, introduced a campaign to donate food for the 1.5 million children in England who qualify for free school meals. With schools closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, he said, those children were missing out on what may have been their most reliable source of nourishment. He had received free school meals as a child, he said, so he knew how valuable they were. In June, Mr. Rashford forced the government — which had initially refused — into an embarrassing turnaround that led to an extension of the program over the six-week summer vacation. When asked to further extend the program for another six months, the government refused, despite a public petition that gathered more than a million signatures. It was not long before dozens, then hundreds and, finally, thousands of businesses, large and small, volunteered to plug the gap the government had left. Mr. Rashford has illustrated the scale of the problem to thousands who might not have grasped it otherwise. His Twitter feed has recently been little more than a list of businesses, small and large, offering free school meals or programs to help alleviate hunger. He barely mentioned the three goals he scored for Manchester United in the Champions League last week. —

Mount Everest empties as Covid-19 strikes tourism in Nepal. Wearing protective gear during the Pachali Bhairav festival in Kathmandu, Nepal, in October. Credit... Niranjan Shrestha/Associated Press Last year, Nepal attracted so many mountain climbers that a traffic jam of hundreds of mountaineers snarled a trail to the top of Mount Everest. It was unmistakable proof of a tourism industry that was spinning out of control — but still one that had become a lifeline for the country. Last year, the industry brought in more than $2 billion to Nepal, one of Asia’s poorest countries, and employed a million people, from porters to pilots. The pandemic has stopped all of that. The trails snaking through the Himalayas are deserted, including those leading up to Everest Base Camp. Fewer than 150 climbers have arrived this fall season, immigration officials said, down from thousands last year. Countless Sherpas and mountain guides have been put out of work, leaving many to plant barley or graze yaks across the empty slopes to survive. Many Nepalis fear that the combined effect of the coronavirus and the hammer blow to the economy could set their nation back for years. “I often think I will die of hunger before corona kills me,” said Upendra Lama, an out-of-work mountain porter who now relies on food handouts to provide for himself and his children. “How long will this go on?” Although the whole world is asking similar questions, Nepal has few resources to help people cope. Covid-19 cases are steadily rising, and with around 1,000 intensive-care beds for a population of 30 million, the authorities have instructed people who get sick to stay home unless they slip into critical condition. An unknown number may die undetected. The economic wreckage is easier to see. Hotels and the teahouses clinging to the sides of mountains are boarded up. Restaurants, gear shops and even some of the most popular watering holes in the capital, Kathmandu, have closed for the foreseeable future. — Bhadra Sharma and

Global Roundup Australia reports no new cases for the first time in nearly five months. Circular Quay, a tourist area in Sydney, Australia, last month. Credit... Matthew Abbott for The New York Times Australia reported its first day of no new coronavirus cases in nearly five months, paving the way for further easing of restrictions. In the 24 hours between 8 p.m. Friday and 8 p.m. Saturday the country reported no locally transmitted cases — the first 24-hour period since June 9 without a new case. Late Saturday, the state of New South Wales reported one new case. The lack of new cases comes less than a week after Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, emerged from an 111-day lockdown imposed during a second wave that at its peak in August saw over 700 new cases a day. Residents can now sit in cafes, restaurants and pubs for the first time since July. More restrictions are set to be eased this coming weekend. Greg Hunt, the country’s health minister, told local media that Australia was on track for restrictions on travel between states to be removed by Christmas. Residents of New South Wales and Victoria are barred from visiting some states and must quarantine for 14 days when entering other states. On Monday, the state of Victoria recorded a third straight day with no new cases. In other news around the world: Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the leader of the World Health Organization , said late Sunday on Twitter that he was quarantining after a contact tested positive. “I am well and without symptoms but will self-quarantine over the coming days, in line with @WHO protocols, and work from home,” he said.

Cambodia on Monday announced that schools could reopen for the first time since March if they meet certain safety standards. Like some of its regional neighbors, the Southeast Asian nation has avoided a large outbreak of the coronavirus. “We are also worried that the reopening will be risky,” Hang Chuon Naron, the minister of education, said on Mon",,
When the Virus Came for the American Dream,"At Doraville’s City Council meetings, the primary concerns were no longer mask mandates or testing centers but construction permits, noise complaints, code violations. “People want to get back to normal,” Rebekah Cohen Morris told me. “They want this all to be over.”

And yet true normalcy, in the prepandemic sense, felt impossible to imagine, at least until a vaccine arrived. A second spike in new infections could send everyone on Buford Highway into lockdown again, shutting down the construction, slowing the traffic and reversing the small gains business owners enjoyed in September and October. Already there were troubling signs: In one week in late October, health officials reported a 20 percent rise in new infections across the state, along with a corresponding rise in hospitalizations.

Even if the numbers sink back down through the remainder of the fall and winter, for many residents, the damage has been done. To tenants who owe thousands in back rent to their landlords, to the former employees of shuttered hotels and restaurants, to the children of low-income families, who often do not have the Wi-Fi or laptops needed to attend remote-learning sessions and are frequently conscripted into babysitting siblings while their parents work. “I think we made a trade-off, and now we’re living with the consequences,” Cohen Morris told me. “We didn’t want to close our bars or our movie theaters. It was like, ‘Hey, maybe if we reopen and pretend everything is going to be OK, maybe that will make it OK.’ Instead of doing what we needed to do, which was to hunker down. And now you’ve got an already vulnerable population that has been made even more vulnerable.”

Researchers are only beginning to understand the effects of the pandemic and the official handling of it on small businesses, but here, too, the early findings are grim. Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, recently published a study trying to gauge the pandemic’s effect on small businesses in The Journal of Economics and Management Strategy. Working from U.S. Census data, he found that the number of active business owners in the country fell by 22 percent between February and April — and immigrant business owners fared much worse, decreasing by 36 percent. Though many returned to work by June, the numbers still remained 18 percent below what they had been. Among the demographics Fairlie surveyed, only Black business owners fared slightly worse. The collapse of negotiations between the White House and Congress over a second round of stimulus funding, meanwhile, has not only precluded the possibility of further P.P.P. loans but also produced problems for business owners who received the first round. There is little clarity over how the loans are to be taxed and how businesses that are still struggling can apply to have them forgiven.

When I went to Monsoon Masala for the last time, in October, the dining room was cold and dark. Alam emerged from the kitchen wearing a mask embroidered with a bear’s nose and whiskers — a gift from his daughter. “I’d give it to you,” he said, when I admired it, “but it has my germs.”

We sat down at one of the tables. Alam slid a saltshaker back and forth between his hands. How was his wife? “Good,” Alam said. “OK.” Then he corrected himself. “Bad. We have the same conversation almost every day. What to do? What to do, what to do.”

Just 10 months earlier, Alam was dreaming of opening a second location of Monsoon Masala. Now it was all he could do to keep the original restaurant afloat. He recalled that a few weeks earlier, he and his business partners came up with a last-ditch scheme: Half the space would remain a restaurant. The other half would be converted into a combination hookah lounge and bar. They’d written up a plan and submitted it to their landlord. The landlord refused on account of a county ordinance — the space wasn’t big enough. The far corner of the restaurant was still roped off.

"In San Francisco, Virus Is Contained but Schools Are Still Closed","As a third wave of coronavirus infections has begun to take off across much of the country, San Francisco has been a bright spot. After experiencing a surge of cases over the summer, the city has tamped down infections to near their lowest levels since the pandemic began. Restaurants, movie theaters, and museums are open at 25 percent of capacity.

One crucial part of the city, however, remains firmly closed: The public schools.

Even as private and parochial schools have begun to reopen their doors, the school district has not set a timeline for resuming in-person instruction, except to say that it is not likely in this calendar year.

The district’s decision to stay closed this fall, even as other urban districts — including New York City, Miami, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia — have opened or set dates for partially reopening, has angered many parents, local health experts and the mayor, London Breed, who does not control the school system.

It has also touched off, in this very politically progressive city, a sharp debate about how best to safely educate low-income and minority students during the pandemic — and over who speaks for the Asian, Latino and Black families who together represent a majority of the district.",11/1/20 0:00,
Virus Rate Fell to 2% From 34% in One Area. But Did Anything Change?,"But he acknowledged that several family members of infected people whom he recently had visited as part of Hatzolah’s “Covid brigade,” a home-health check service, declined to get tested for the virus. He dismissed it as insignificant.

“If someone doesn’t want to do a test, one or two people maybe, it doesn’t mean that the whole village wants to do it,” Mr. Brach said.

Dr. Gelman said her contact tracers were sometimes stymied in their efforts in the community. For example, in several recent cases, school administrators at ultra-Orthodox schools in Kiryas Joel that remained open despite the lockdown order, did not respond to contact tracers’ calls after children at school tested positive.

“Clearly these are not isolated incidents, where there are one or two or three individuals that presented over the course of a month or two that all of a sudden declined testing,” Dr. Gelman said. “This is a lot more widespread.”

Drastic drops in the positivity like the one in Orange County are highly unusual, said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. She said the situation may reflect a lesson epidemiologists have learned from countless previous outbreaks and pandemics.

“If public health measures are seen as punitive,” she said, “you will drive cases underground.”

In the Brooklyn “red zone,” the rates have also dropped, but far more gradually: In the last week of September, the test positivity rate in the Brooklyn area with the highest level of restriction was 7.7 percent. On Oct. 29, the rolling average in the area was about 4 percent, a state official said.

Last week, New York City health officials said that they had also heard similar concerning reports of test refusal in the city’s red zones.",11/2/20 0:00,
"States Undercount Positive Rapid Tests, Masking the Spread of Disease","As rapid coronavirus tests are becoming more widely available, delivering results in minutes for patients in doctor's offices, nursing homes, schools and even the White House, officials warn of a significant undercount, blurring the virus's spread nationally and in communities where such tests are more commonly used.

Public health officials say that antigen tests, which are faster than polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.) tests but less able to detect low levels of the virus, are an important tool for limiting the spread of the coronavirus. But they caution that with inconsistent public reporting, the case undercount may worsen as more “point-of-care” antigen tests, as well as D.I.Y. and home test kits, come on the market.

“We want to be sure that we’re not now saying, ‘there’s no disease,’ when there is lots of disease. All that’s happened is that the science with which we identify it has evolved,” said Janet Hamilton, the executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, the group that helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define cases of the coronavirus.

Public health experts say that more coronavirus rapid testing will lead to more undercounting of coronavirus cases, even in states that attempt to count them publicly. What’s going on?

Some states do not count cases based on antigen tests

Despite C.D.C. guidance to report cases based on P.C.R. and antigen testing, Washington, D.C. and seven states don’t publicly share case counts for those with antigen positive tests, including California, New Jersey and Texas.

Another six states keep these tallies separate from their total case counts, and most of these report them less frequently.

The differences among states are due in part to each state’s comfort level with the rapid tests, which aren’t “confirmatory” like P.C.R. tests because they can miss low levels of the virus. Yet most states treat antigen positive cases or “probable” cases the same as “confirmed” cases, by following up with interviews and contact tracing. And a growing number of states, including New Mexico, Oregon and Utah, include individuals with positive antigen tests in their total confirmed case counts.

Individuals who test positive from rapid tests are a small but growing share of all publicly reported cases. For example, in Florida, positive cases from antigen tests make up about 4 percent of all cases reported since March, the majority of which are based on P.C.R. But on a daily basis antigen tests contribute a more visible share, making up as much as a third of reported cases in recent days.

These counts are expected to increase as rapid tests purchased by the federal government reach schools and nursing homes across the country this fall.

And cases based on antigen tests can be even more significant in counties where these rapid tests have been more abundant.

For example, at least 26 of 254 Texas counties tally antigen positive cases on local health department websites, and several reveal an increasing dependence on rapid test results. The state health department doesn’t yet report these.

In Brown County, in west-central Texas, antigen tests have been widely available since the summer, so the county posts positive cases from rapid tests and from P.C.R. to offer a more complete view of infection, said Lisa Dick, administrator of the Brownwood-Brown County Health Department.

“If we just posted P.C.R. tests we would just be giving the community the idea that things were improving,” said Ms. Dick. “And people are making decisions based on that information, from leaders to individuals.”

In Taylor County in rural west Texas, individuals who test positive with rapid tests make up more than half of all cases, as the tests are accessible in the county’s many urgent care centers, said Dr. Annie Drachenberg, the medical director for Abilene-Taylor County Health District.

Patients also tend to prefer the same-day results that antigen tests offer, said Dr. Drachenberg, noting that the turnaround time for P.C.R. results peaked at two weeks over the summer before returning to one or two days this fall.

“Once you’ve broken that trust with a patient in terms of getting that answer quickly, it’s hard to get that trust back.”

Nontraditional testing centers can leave states in the dark

Whether states publicly report antigen positive cases or just track them internally, many public health officials say their counts are incomplete because they don’t know where rapid testing is taking place in their jurisdictions.

And unlike laboratories that typically perform more complicated P.C.R. tests, many of the “point-of-care” centers doing antigen testing, such as nursing homes, urgent care centers and schools, either don’t realize they need to report lab data, or may rely on slower, less efficient methods such as phone calls and faxes.

“We don’t know for sure what we don’t know,” said Dr. Edward Lifshitz, medical director of the Communicable Disease Service at the New Jersey Department of Health, which doesn’t publicly report antigen positive cases because the figure is incomplete.

Dr. Lifshitz added that sharing data on antigen positive cases might make some parts of the state, where point-of-care testing centers are reporting correctly, appear worse off than other areas that have missing data.

“It will look like, ‘boy, this part of the state is having an increase in cases,’ when it’s really not,” he said. “It’s just that they are reporting what they are supposed to be reporting.”

To avoid missing antigen test results, some health departments have had to do their own outreach.

In Houston, where infections surged over the summer, health officials searched for rapid testing centers online, made phone calls and posted a “dear provider” letter on their website. In New Jersey, officials have been collecting testing facility names from antigen test manufacturers and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which distributed rapid tests to nursing homes across the state.

But even then, testing centers can still be missed.

Since late September, Alabama has reported three spikes of older cases because point-of-care facilities had neglected to report to public health officials their antigen test results. An urgent care group was responsible for the largest increase, which was reported on Oct. 23, after the addition of older cases nearly tripled the daily count.

Alabama health officials say that as they learn of new testing centers, they are training them to share test data in an electronic format that they can easily work with. Health officials across the country in states like California, Georgia, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Texas, are doing the same, but training can be labor and time intensive, and many testing centers don’t have the technical support they need.

“This is a pipeline that is not well established,” said Kirstin Short, bureau chief of epidemiology at the Houston Health Department.

Many more tests are on the way

Scientists who follow the development of coronavirus tests say that rapid testing capacity — most of it antigen-based — could reach 200 million tests a month by early next year, and help the country reach recommended testing levels.

In September the country reported more than 20 million completed P.C.R. tests and about 5 million antigen tests, though the latter is a significant undercount, according to Mara G. Aspinall, a professor of practice in biomedical diagnostics at Arizona State University who tracks Covid-19 testing.

Antigen testing is also expected to grow beyond “point-of-care” tests to include portable kits that individuals can administer themselves. In fact, about two dozen companies are working on these personal rapid tests, according to Ms. Aspinall.

Public health officials say these home-based tests, much like a pregnancy test, may be nearly impossible to track. Some experts have also expressed concerns that home-based testing could come with its own set of pitfalls, as large groups of people inexperienced with administering tests use the products and try to interpret their results.

“We may eventually get these tests over the counter,” said Dr. Lifshitz of the New Jersey Department of Health. “From a public health perspective that’s a good thing. From a surveillance perspective that becomes a nightmare.”",11/1/20 0:00,
How the Wealthy World Has Failed Poor Countries During the Pandemic,"LONDON — Like much of the developing world, Pakistan was alarmingly short of doctors and medical facilities long before anyone had heard of Covid-19. Then the pandemic overwhelmed hospitals, forcing some to turn away patients. As fear upended daily life, families lost livelihoods and struggled to feed themselves.

On the other side of the world in Washington, two deep-pocketed organizations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, vowed to spare poor countries from desperation. Their economists warned that immense relief was required to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and profound damage to global prosperity. Emerging markets make up 60 percent of the world economy, by one I.M.F. measure. A blow to their fortunes inflicts pain around the planet.

Wages sent home to poor countries by migrant workers — a vital artery of finance — have diminished. The shutdown of tourism has punished many developing countries. So has plunging demand for oil. Billions of people have lost the wherewithal to buy food, increasing malnutrition. By next year, the pandemic could push 150 million people into extreme poverty, the World Bank has warned, in the first increase in more than two decades.

But the World Bank and the I.M.F. have failed to translate their concern into meaningful support, say economists. That has left less-affluent countries struggling with limited resources and untenable debts, prompting their governments to reduce spending just as it is needed to bolster health care systems and aid people suffering lost income.",11/1/20 0:00,
"U.S. Diplomat Coughs Online, and European Allies Wonder if They Were Exposed","But the State Department has at times severely limited overseas travel even before the coronavirus, such as during the Ebola crisis and government shutdowns or other budget negotiations when diplomats were told to talk to their foreign counterparts over the phone or by video conference.

Particularly in the pandemic-induced era of Zoom calls, current and former diplomats said, it is not clear what made Mr. Berkowitz’s European trip so essential that it was worth the risk.

“What’s the cost to America’s image if we infect our foreign interlocutors?” said David Wade, the chief of staff to former Secretary of State John Kerry.

During the 2014 government shutdown, “I had a line outside my door on Mahogany Row of people who didn’t want to cancel trips,” said Mr. Wade, referring to the elegant décor of the secretary’s office suite. But he said: “If everything’s essential, nothing’s essential. Appearances on public panels aren’t the Camp David accords.”

Mr. Pompeo and Stephen E. Biegun, the deputy secretary, also continue to travel, but usually fly on government aircraft and are accompanied by State Department medical staff who constantly monitor their health and, when necessary, administer coronavirus tests as required for entering many foreign nations.

In comments to journalists aboard his plane on Oct. 2, shortly after leaving Croatia, Mr. Pompeo described a balance in deciding when face-to-face meetings were essential. He said the pandemic would help the department “be leaner and better and more efficient than we were when we came into this.”

“It’s been a little harder to travel around the world as a diplomat and see people,” Mr. Pompeo said. “It always matters how you can have private conversations that are harder to have on the phone, but at the same time, we’ve all adapted just as your businesses have, just as every company and every family has had to do.”",11/1/20 0:00,
Caregivers Have Witnessed the Coronavirus’s Pain. How Will They Vote?,"“If you don’t see it, you really don’t understand how difficult it is,” said Louise Santee, a longtime caregiver who brought a curling iron to work to calm a resident who could not understand why she could no longer go to the hairdresser. “It is truly heart-wrenching when you see what this has done to our people.”

In interviews, caregivers as well as patient advocates, medical professionals, facility managers and residents themselves said they had never experienced anything like the first six months of the pandemic.

Maintenance workers were sent to hardware stores to buy disposable paint tarps that could be fashioned into gowns. Nurses pleaded with their bosses to let them lower their masks just so residents could recognize them; some forced their family members to go stay with relatives, terrified that they would bring the virus into their home. And some residents could not understand why they were suddenly cut off from their families and the world.

The chaos was so pervasive that it was nearly impossible, everyone said, to separate what was happening from the politics at play. As caretakers endured day after exhausting day, state officials set forth new regulations to govern how nursing homes should work. And President Trump delivered a drumbeat of dangerous claims — mocking masks, praising unproven treatments, speculating about bleach and about the virus disappearing.

Some residents became so dismayed by Mr. Trump’s conduct that they set up voter registration drives on their campuses; others held mini protests near major roads, holding signs and soliciting honks from passing vehicles. A few frontline workers began phone banking at home and writing to their state legislators.

And top officials at care facilities voiced deep frustration about how the virus response rapidly devolved from a public health issue to a partisan fight. They insisted that faster, clearer and better-coordinated government intervention could have saved lives.

“When you work in our business, you become accustomed to a certain level of bumbling,” said Jim Bernardo, the president of Presbyterian Senior Living, which cares for thousands of older people in Pennsylvania and beyond. “This rose to an entirely different level.”",11/1/20 0:00,

Governors around the country, particularly Republican ones, are following the president’s lead in resisting new restrictions against a virus that has powerfully persisted despite lockdowns in some areas over the spring and summer.

Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota wrote that “there is no way to stop the virus,” while Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota said that when it comes to saving lives, “it’s not a job for government, this is a job for everybody.” In Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee told residents that “at the end of the day, personal responsibility is the only way.” Gov. Mike Dunleavy of Alaska said in an interview that rising case numbers this fall should not cause people to go into hiding.

“It’s like being told you’re going to get hit with a meteorite,” Mr. Dunleavy said. “There comes a point where people just say, ‘I still have to live. I still have to work. I still have to have contact with my family.’”

With the weather cooling and people moving their lives back indoors, the virus has begun an autumn rampage across the country far exceeding the peaks of months prior. On Friday, the nation set a record of more than 98,000 infections in a single day. Deaths have also started to slightly rise again.

Despite the bleak trends, Mr. Trump has railed against lockdown restrictions and tried to convey a message that the country is “rounding the corner” — a claim in conflict with the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who has said that more caution is necessary, not less, and that people should not expect a return to normal for perhaps another year. Mr. Trump suggested on Sunday night that he may fire Dr. Fauci after the election.

Watching for signs of a ‘blue wave’

Patty Schachtner won the seat in a special election, in a district in northwestern Wisconsin that was seen as solidly conservative. A Republican had held the seat for 17 years. Ms. Schachtner’s win was seen as an erosion of the president’s support. This year, she has been outspent by her Republican opponent, State Representative Rob Stafsholt.

The biggest criminal justice reform prize yet

Progressive prosecutors have taken office across America in recent years, promising to reduce prison populations and fight racial bias. Activists supporting their campaigns always saw Los Angeles County, with the country’s largest prosecutor’s office and jail system, as the ultimate prize. In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing in Minneapolis and nationwide protests, the Los Angeles race took on greater significance. Liberal leaders like Mayor Eric M. Garcetti pulled their endorsements of the incumbent, Jackie Lacey, who critics say has not done enough to reduce incarceration and prosecute police officers for shootings. Those endorsements, plus money from Hollywood and outside liberal groups, flowed toward the challenger, George Gascón, the former top prosecutor in San Francisco who has promised to take a tougher line on police shootings.

"Virus Hospitalizations Are Up in N.Y.C. But This Time, It’s Different.","Public health officials and epidemiologists had expected a resurgence of the virus in New York as the weather cooled, but many believed its impact would likely be less devastating than in the spring. Now, about 460 people are hospitalized in the city with Covid-19 — near the highest levels seen since late June. That is nowhere near the peak in April, when the virus patient count on one day was more than 12,000.

For now, patients who have been admitted tend to be doing better.

Lorenzo Paladino, an emergency room doctor at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, recalled how during the spring, some patients were “dying at the door” as they entered the emergency department or going into cardiac arrest while in the ambulance bay.

Now, he said, patients tended to arrive in better shape.

One reason might be that patients are not waiting to go to the hospital, as they were encouraged to do by health authorities at the height of the pandemic in New York, when crowding was an issue and seemingly milder cases were turned away.

There are other factors, too. Nursing home patients today make up a smaller share of new cases, Dr. Katz said. And there are some indications that people being infected now tend to be younger on average than those in the spring, making them more likely to recover.",10/30/20 0:00,

Experts Wonder Why.,"“Always in everything, ‘It’s the Jews’ fault,’ they are trying to pin everything on us,” said Moshe Brach, an ultra-Orthodox liaison for the Orange Regional Medical Center in Middletown, N.Y., and a volunteer emergency medical technician with the Hatzolah ambulance service.

[Experts question whether officials are tracking the virus effectively.]

The background

For months, the virus seemed to be in check in New York.

But in October, a surge in cases in Orange County, as well as in Brooklyn, Queens and other communities with large populations of ultra-Orthodox Jewish residents, raised fears of a second wave of the pandemic.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced a series of restrictions until the situation improved: Nonessential business and schools were closed, and houses of worship faced limits on capacity.

Then, in mid-October, urgent calls from doctors came to the Orange County health department.

“Some patients are refusing testing because they do not want D.O.H. bothering them,” a doctor said in a message for the county health commissioner on Oct. 13.

A caller to a state complaint hotline said in a message, “I would also like to report that there is a widespread effort from the community’s leadership to discourage Covid testing.”

The experts’ take

The positivity rate has become one of the most recognizable metrics in understanding the pandemic.

"A Rapid Virus Test Falters in People Without Symptoms, Study Finds","As the number of coronavirus cases in the United States exceeds 9.2 million, experts continue to call for an enormous scale-up of testing among both the healthy and the sick — a necessary measure, they have said, to curb the spread of an infection that can move swiftly and silently through the population.

One strategy has involved the widespread use of rapid tests, which forgo sophisticated equipment and can return results in minutes. Purchased in bulk by the federal government and shipped nationwide, millions of these products have already found their way into clinics, nursing homes, schools, athletic teams’ facilities and more, buoying hopes that the tests might hasten a return to normalcy.

But a new study casts doubt on whether rapid tests perform as promised under real-world conditions, especially when used in people without symptoms.

In a head-to-head comparison, researchers at the University of Arizona found that, in symptomatic people, a rapid test made by Quidel could detect more than 80 percent of coronavirus infections found by a slower, lab-based P.C.R. test. But when the rapid test was used instead to randomly screen students and staff members who did not feel sick, it detected only 32 percent of the positive cases identified by the P.C.R. test.",11/2/20 0:00,

A committee of experts advising Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is considering the idea.

Death Rates Have Dropped for Seriously Ill Covid Patients,"The coronavirus struck the United States earlier this year with devastating force. In April, it killed more than 10,000 people in New York City. By early May, nearly 50,000 nursing home residents and their caregivers across the country had died.

But as the virus continued its rampage over the summer and fall, infecting nearly 8.5 million Americans, survival rates, even of seriously ill patients, appeared to be improving. At one New York hospital system where 30 percent of coronavirus patients died in March, the death rate had dropped to 3 percent by the end of June.

Doctors in England observed a similar trend. “In late March, four in 10 people in intensive care were dying. By the end of June, survival was over 80 percent,” said John M. Dennis, a University of Exeter Medical School researcher who is first author of a paper about improved survival rates in Britain, accepted for publication in the journal Critical Care Medicine. “It was really quite dramatic.”

Though the virus has been changing slowly as it spreads, and some have speculated that it has become more easily transmissible, most scientists say there is no solid evidence that it has become either less virulent, or more virulent. As elderly people sheltered inside and took precautions to avoid infection, however, more of the hospitalized patients were younger adults, who were generally healthier and more resilient. By the end of August, the average patient was under 40.",10/29/20 0:00,
The Double Whammy of Seasonal Affective Disorder in a Season of Covid,"Although the symptoms of SAD normally disappear completely every summer, Dr. Rohan said, “in the summer of 2020 we didn’t see a full remission in our patients. With such big stresses going on, they are overriding the seasonal pattern.”

Dr. Rohan fears that the anxiety and stress provoked by the pandemic will increase the risk and severity of winter depression for everyone. “It’s possible that those with subclinical SAD will become clinical,” she said. “People will be limited in what they can do to stay well even if they normally have good coping resources.”

However, Dr. Rosenthal said, “Just understanding the issues can give people a blueprint for handling them more effectively.” Most helpful for people with SAD, he said, is exposure to sunlight or its artificial equivalent for 20 to 30 minutes every morning. The standard amount of light needed is 10,000 lux. Sitting under a commercial light box at least one-foot square will do the job. Also helpful is using a dawn simulator in the bedroom or a light set on a timer to turn on 10 or 20 minutes before you get up.

LIGHT THERAPY Wirecutter, a New York Times company, reviews light boxes here.

My late husband was helped by walking the dog for half an hour or so every morning after sunrise.

“A 20-minute early morning walk in the sun is as good as commercial light therapy,” Dr. Rosenthal said, “but while morning is best, whenever you can do a walk is helpful. The combination of exercise and outdoor light is crucially important. It connects you with your environment — not just the light but also the birds, trees, animal life, neighborhood — all can act as an antidote to the cocoon of isolation.”

Our conversation reminded me of the spirit-lifting tactics I had adopted during the devastating early months of the pandemic, when my city was the epicenter of Covid-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths. I made a point of finding something every day that brought joy: new growth on neighborhood trees, emerging blooms in people’s yards, watching my dog play with his canine pals, flirting with toddlers on the street, doing an evening shout-out for our essential workers who put their lives on the line for the rest of us.

“Don’t squeeze joy out of your life,” Dr. Rosenthal said emphatically. “There’s got to be joy every day. It’s an upfront investment that pays off handsomely.” He suggested taking classes online, perhaps learning to make jewelry or paint or play an instrument. Also very important is staying connected with people, perhaps by scheduling a socially distant lunch date or joining a friend for coffee or tea.",11/2/20 0:00,
"What Losing My Father Taught Me About Parenting, Planets and Pain","When we said goodbye, last New Year’s Eve, my father had already become hard of hearing. The end was very near. In our final video chat, I was able to show him how the rug from his childhood home, which we carried back across the Atlantic in an oversize suitcase on the plane, fit just perfectly in our new living room. My father marveled, through his small phone screen, at the size of our lush green garden, the towering, bending palms, the ancient olive tree. He delighted in hearing about our weekend walks down the windy Mediterranean seashore. From our terrace, I could use my phone to show it to him: a stretch of turquoise in the hazy distance. He admired the view from my new home office, virtually visited the kids’ messy bedrooms, and toured the kitchen, and the stone steps up from the road to the front door.

He called again the next day, but somehow, though my phone was increasingly glued to the palm of my hand, I didn’t hear the ring. I spoke to him one last time the following morning, between sobs, as my mom held the phone to his ear. He managed to blurt out my nickname, but nothing more, before fading away. For weeks I wondered what he had called to say, what I had missed that day before, when he was still able to utter words. What important message had he wanted to perhaps impart, before silence set in?

In the many sleepless nights since, I’ve reviewed our final conversations. In the darkest hours, I’ve revisited and revisited many of our last walks, our visits, those light-filled moments as a complete family, and finally, I’ve found comfort and solace in the pattern of our chats, in the single meaning behind each and every thought my father shared.

Like the darkness that holds together our universe, there’s a line in the sand connecting each grain of thought; he was, in fact, saying more than I’d understood, overwhelmed as I was by his dying, and by my grief. His questions and enthusiasm about our future were not just vessels for denial, or avoidance. They weren’t signs that he had nothing more pressing on his mind, nothing larger he wished to discuss.

This focus of his, in hindsight, reflected everything that mattered to him most, which was his family; it was us. Our happiness, our health, our comfort, our continuing existence in this world he was too soon departing. In the end, I realize what my father left me with were just the lessons I needed, to remain resilient through this move, his illness and death, and now also this pandemic.

My father was a fan of Winston Churchill, and as I carry my grief forward with me, along with these lessons from the man who brought me into this world, I’m reminded of a famous quote by this politician he admired: “This is not the end,” Churchill said. “It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”

Although I’m already decades into my life, like a new phase of the moon, the loss of my father also feels like a new beginning — one without a parent who’s been there every step of the way, so far.

"Pandemic Grandparenting, Beyond the Dreary Video Calls","As a veteran television journalist, Sally-Ann Roberts knows how to tame an unsteady landscape and will it into submission. She survived 40 years reporting and anchoring the news for WWL-TV in New Orleans, covering 10 races for mayor and in 2005, Hurricane Katrina, a storm that submerged four-fifths of the city in water and left her rebuilding her home for nearly two unforgiving years. But as far as grandparenting during the coronavirus pandemic, she says she’s met her match.

“I am not doing the job I should be doing as a grandparent,” she said.

“Before Covid, we’d have the five grandkids over for ‘Sunday Time,’ from the afternoon until after dark. I’d usually have time to take each one of them aside. Give them each undivided attention. Now, that’s ended. Now, that special time is rare. Now, when we get together, we can’t even sit at the same table.”

Ms. Roberts had a different kind of grandparenting in mind when she retired in 2018. Early on in the pandemic, she decided it would be safer for her and her family if she kept her distance. She reduced their visits from once a week, often more, to about once a month. Yet even when they do see each other, the need to wear masks and maintain physical distance has changed the quality of her interactions, she says, making conversations with her grandchildren more “transactional” and less meaningful. Conversations now with the oldest of her grandchildren, two boys, 5 and 12, center more on schedules and grades rather than deeper talks about faith and what she hopes for their future.",10/30/20 0:00,
Gilead’s Covid-19 Drug Is Mediocre. It Will Be a Blockbuster Anyway.,"The United States reached a milestone, of sorts, when last week the Food and Drug Administration approved the first treatment for Covid-19.

The drug is called Veklury, although most people know it by its scientific name, remdesivir.

On Wednesday, its manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, said that remdesivir, which has been authorized for emergency use since the spring, had brought in $873 million in revenues so far this year and that it was the company’s second-best-selling drug in the third quarter, behind its H.I.V. drug, Biktarvy.

But the F.D.A.’s decision to grant the drug full approval — which means the company can now begin broadly marketing it to doctors and patients — has puzzled several outside experts, who say that it may not deserve the agency’s stamp of approval because it is, at best, a mediocre treatment for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. And they have questioned whether Gilead deserves to pocket potential billions from the drug when the federal government has played a significant role in its development.

“This is a troubling approval,” said Dr. Peter B. Bach, the director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “This is an extremely weak set of trials to support an approval for an antiviral.”",10/29/20 0:00,
Clemson’s Trevor Lawrence Tests Positive for the Coronavirus,"Trevor Lawrence, the star quarterback at top-ranked Clemson and a leading contender for the Heisman Trophy, has tested positive for coronavirus, the university said Thursday night.

Tigers Coach Dabo Swinney said in a statement that Lawrence was “doing well with mild symptoms” but that he would miss Saturday’s home game against Boston College. Perhaps more crucially for the race toward the College Football Playoff, Swinney did not say when Lawrence had tested positive or when he had developed symptoms — distinctions that could determine whether he would be eligible to play at No. 4 Notre Dame on Nov. 7.

“While we certainly will miss Trevor, this is an opportunity for other guys to step up and we’re excited about competing against a very good B.C. team on Saturday,” Swinney said.",10/29/20 0:00,
"Using the Law to Fight Epidemics, for Better and Worse","There’s something to be said for a book that takes the bewildering cacophony of American approaches to the pandemic and tries to bring some clarity to how we got here. In “American Contagions,” John Fabian Witt, a legal historian at Yale, offers a brisk guide to how epidemics have shaped U.S. law, and how the law has shaped epidemics in turn, taking us from the smallpox outbreaks of the colonies to Covid-19.

A hundred years after the devastation wreaked by the 1918 flu, an American century has come to this: 220,000 dead as the White House toggles between ignoring and stoking the coronavirus, discouraging mitigation efforts while pouring all its hopes into a “warp-speed” vaccine.

A deeply held American myth maintains that the country has consistently emphasized individual liberty over collective solidarity, but Witt says that this wasn’t always the case. Early responses to infectious disease often involved far-reaching state and local interventions. Vaccine campaigns and sanitary codes were explicitly promoted as both a health necessity and a crucial social gesture, giving rise to a “jurisprudence of hygiene.” As the Massachusetts Sanitary Commission put it in 1850, “We are social beings — bound together by indissoluble ties.” The commission explained that public health policies would “protect one set of human beings from being the victims of disease and death through the selfish cupidity of others.”

Witt identifies two main approaches to contagion threaded throughout American history: “sanitationism” and “quarantinism.” Sanitationists have focused on people’s health and improving their living conditions, while quarantinists have advanced more authoritarian and discriminatory measures. The prevalence of each approach has waxed and waned, depending on the geographical context and particular era, but one theme that emerges from Witt’s book is how they both mapped onto existing inequalities.",10/28/20 0:00,
"These Hand Sanitizers Smell Good, Kill Germs","The company’s Botanic Hand Sanitizer is a light liquid that, if poured into a glass, could be mistaken for gin. The spicy scent, called Four Thieves, is redolent with clove and cinnamon; it brings to mind a wintry fruitcake. The name and formula were inspired by medieval criminals who, according to legend, avoided contracting the bubonic plague by anointing themselves with a similar blend of botanicals, Ms. McLachlan said.

A second scent, an herbaceous blend called Basilisk Breath, was introduced on July 16.

Beauty brands are also introducing hand sanitizers. Biossance, a popular skin care line, came out with one last month with moisturizing squalane. The Brooklyn fragrance house DS & Durga added one with a eucalyptus-based scent to its collection in April.

The skin care line Peter Thomas Roth unveiled its version in April; the makeup brand Nudestix introduced hand sanitizer in June. Shen Beauty, the influential beauty boutique in Brooklyn, created one it began selling this month.

Predictably, these elevated products come with a commensurate price tag. At $12 for a two-ounce bottle, the Amass hand sanitizer costs about eight times as much as a purse-size hand sanitizer at CVS. On the other hand, Augustinus Bader, the cultish German line that includes a $165 body cream, has, since May, been offering a limited supply of the hand sanitizer it created for front line workers to consumers for free, for a small shipping fee.

Higher prices haven’t necessarily deterred shoppers. March and April sales of Jao Brand’s Refresher hand sanitizer, which was introduced in 1997 and costs between $10 and $18, depending on size, exceeded those for all of last year, according to a representative of the brand. (Admittedly, one factor of high sales could be the low supply, at least early in the pandemic, of traditional hand sanitizers, although some high-end brands have also sold out of these products over the last couple of months.)",7/22/20 0:00,
"Shed Your Quarantine Skin (and Hair and Nails), Safely","The first thing to ask yourself, according to Celine Gounder, an infectious disease expert and former assistant health commissioner for New York City, is whether there’s still widespread community transmission in your area. If there is, she said, “then I think as with anything, whether it’s school reopenings or nonessential services — and to me, this is a nonessential service — those need to be shut down until you can get your community transmission under control.” Some areas that forged ahead with reopenings are pausing or even rolling back those plans; in Los Angeles County, personal care facilities that began operating again in mid-June are now limited to treating clients outdoors.

Evaluate the risk to yourself and others.

If a treatment is available to you, reflect on how essential it is, and how much you’ll be exposing yourself if you receive it. “Step back one step and think, ‘Do I need to do this or do I want to do it?’” Dr. El-Sadr said. When it comes to assessing the relative risk of different appointments, she explained, there are two primary variables: the duration of your treatment and your distance from the person providing your service. Time can vary widely (think of a polish change compared with a full Mani-Pedi), and you should try to limit the length of your appointment, but one thing is constant: It’s nearly impossible to maintain a six-foot distance. Consider, too, how many other people will be in the room; a private therapy is inevitably safer than one that places you in a room with several other people.

The risk also increases for you — and the person providing your service — if you have to remove your mask or they have to touch your face. So you should forego lip and eyebrow waxes or threading, facials and professional makeup artistry. And Shari Lipner, a dermatologist at Weill-Cornell Medical Center who specializes in nail disorders, recommends skipping the cuticle trim that usually accompanies a manicure, since cuticles help seal off the nail beds from microorganisms.

Book an appointment.

In the past, you may have dipped out during your lunch break for a manicure or bikini wax, but, these days, there’s comfort to be found in planning ahead. Plus, some salons and spas aren’t yet taking walk-in clients and will turn you away unless they have a stylist, technician or massage therapist available at that exact moment.

Before the pandemic, Sauna House’s clientele primarily consisted of walk-ins; now, it operates entirely by appointment. “We created a whole new business,” Mr. Nehlig said. He reduced the capacity of the bathhouse from 28 people to eight, established a time limit inside and increased the time between massage appointments from 15 minutes to 30 minutes. These measures help maintain social distancing and allow a buffer period for sanitizing.",7/25/20 0:00,
Should I Be Taking Zinc?,"Zinc is the second most common trace mineral in our bodies and affects all organs and cells. It is a micronutrient needed for metabolism, our sense of taste and smell and especially key during times of rapid growth, such as pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and puberty. Zinc deficiency is associated with impaired growth, slower wound healing and increased susceptibility to infections like the common cold.

“It’s very clear: If you are zinc deficient, your immune system will not function as well,” said Dr. David Hafler, professor of neurology and immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine.

Zinc’s importance wasn’t always so clear. In the 1960s, a hematologist named Dr. Ananda S. Prasad suspected that low levels of zinc hampered growth in humans. But when it came time for him to test his hypothesis by administering zinc to his growth-stunted patients in Egypt, he couldn’t find it anywhere. So he had capsules made from bottles of zinc sulfate, and then gave them to these young adults with dwarfism. “I couldn’t believe that an 19-year-old guy could gain over six inches in height,” said Dr. Prasad, of Wayne State University, who stressed that this was specific to nutritionally deficient populations. Though his findings were controversial at the time, his work helped lead the National Academy of Sciences in 1974 to declare zinc an essential element.

Today, sales of zinc supplement, in response to the pandemic, are projected to hit an estimated $134 million, according to Nutrition Business Journal.

As a disclaimer: Nutritional research is often flawed. It’s very unclear how a particular supplement or nutrient can directly affect our health. Why? Since we eat lots of different things, it’s difficult to determine cause and effect, or even influence, of a particular nutrient. So, reader, please approach what follows in that context.

Does zinc help with Covid-19?

There is absolutely no definitive evidence at this time that zinc can help with coronavirus.

Once again: “There is no scientific evidence that zinc or any vitamin or mineral or other dietary supplement can prevent or cure Covid-19,” said Carol Haggans, registered dietitian and consultant to the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Dietary Supplements.

The Food and Drug Administration has sent warning letters to five companies touting zinc products for the prevention, and treatment of the virus.

The World Health Organization said that more research is needed.

Does zinc help with the common cold?

It might.

Zinc lozenges may shorten a cold by about 33 percent, according to a meta-analysis of seven placebo-controlled clinical trials. That’s about two days for a cold that would last a week without treatment. But don’t wait until your nose has turned red to begin. If you would like to take zinc, do so within 24 hours of a cold’s onset — at first sniffle or cough. Though the proper dose has not been determined, the meta-analysis found a possible benefit when sucking on one lozenge every two hours while awake for a total of 75 milligrams or more daily.

Most of the research in this area has been done on lozenges, which are slowly released over a long period of time in the mouth. It is unclear whether pills and other forms of zinc that are swallowed may have the same benefit.

But we’re still not totally sure?

When pharmacist George Eby’s 3-year-old was undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia, he gave her zinc to boost her concentration of the mineral. At the time, she also happened to have a cold. Since she couldn’t swallow, she let it dissolve slowly in her mouth.

After her cold subsided, Dr. Eby worked with two other researchers and conducted the first randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial on the topic, which sparked a field of research that has had inconsistent results. The study only had 65 people.

While another systematic review and metanalysis in the Canadian Medical Association Journal also found a benefit of zinc supplementation, a number of other studies have not, including a new clinical trial.

Zulfiqar Bhutta, director of the Aga Khan University Institute for Global Health and Development, said the studies have been small, and narrow in focus. To gauge zinc’s effectiveness on the common cold, he said we need larger, placebo-controlled trials across geographies, in populations both zinc deficient and not.

Does zinc help with other ailments?

Zinc has been used topically to heal wounds since antiquity. The World Health Organization recommends that children with acute diarrhea take 20 milligrams of zinc for up to two weeks (10 milligrams for infants under six months).

Some previous indications of zinc’s benefit are not being confirmed in more recent studies. Beyond the gastrointestinal infections, Dr. Bhutta said his work with children who were micronutrient deficient did not find that zinc supplements significantly affected stunting, wasting and mortality. “We are also beginning to realize that many deficient populations have multiple micronutrient deficiencies and hence replacing just one nutrient doesn’t make sense, nor gives much benefits,” said Dr. Bhutta.

He is the senior author of a Cochrane Systematic Review that indicated zinc can help reduce both the prevalence and incidence of pneumonia among young children, many with underlying conditions such as H.I.V. infections. But he said recent data, not yet published, doesn’t bear that out in general populations.",9/28/20 0:00,
Not flattening the curve - Arab states are loading up on debt,"TOURISTS MAY not have returned to Egypt’s beaches and historic sites, but the portfolio investors are back. Since May foreigners have snapped up more than $10bn in local-currency debt, reversing a sell-off from the early days of the covid-19 pandemic. There is similar enthusiasm across the region. The six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council issued a record $100bn in public and corporate debt in the first ten months of the year. Treasuries are courting local investors too, though not always successfully: Tunisia’s government was rebuffed when it asked the central bank to buy treasury bonds.

Arab states are on a borrowing binge. Even before covid-19 arrived many were taking on fresh debt to cope with low oil prices and sluggish economies. The pandemic has only increased their needs. By next year public-debt ratios in many of these countries will be at their highest in two decades (see chart). The region’s 11 oil-and-gas-exporting countries owed an average of 25% of GDP from 2000 to 2016. Next year the IMF projects that ratio will hit 47%. Increases are less stark in states without energy resources—but only because they already had some of the world’s highest debt levels. This is not always cause for concern. Saudi Arabia’s debt-to-GDP ratio will reach an estimated 34% next year, up from 17% in 2017. Debt levels in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates will almost double as well, to 37% and 38%. In absolute terms, though, these numbers are comfortably low. All three have well-provisioned central banks or flush sovereign-wealth funds. And capital is cheap: a 35-year tranche of Saudi Eurobonds issued in January, the kingdom’s longest-ever issue, had yields below 4%. Other oil-producing states look shakier. Bahrain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to hit 131% next year, up from an average of 34% from 2000 to 2016. Oman will owe 89%, almost seven times its historic baseline. Both were largely shut out of bond markets earlier this year. Oil markets offer little hope for their budgets: renewed lockdowns in Europe and rising cases in America pushed prices lower in October.

Elsewhere in the region the pandemic has reversed years of fiscal reforms. Egypt reached a $12bn agreement with the IMF in 2016 that saw it trim subsidies and introduce a value-added tax. It brought the deficit from 11% of GDP in 2016 to 7% last year. Egypt was on pace to lower its debt-to-GDP ratio to 79% in 2021. The pandemic, however, sent it back to the IMF for a $5.2bn standby agreement. Next year its debts are projected to climb back to 91% of GDP. Jordan will be close behind at 89%, and Tunisia at 86%.

For now, at least, investors are enthusiastic about Egyptian debt. Yields are high—the last batch of six-month treasury bills paid around 13.5%—and Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi’s authoritarian rule has erased concerns about political instability. But sentiment can be fickle. Between March and May $12.7bn flowed out of local markets. “We saw a swing in the investor mood this year, at the early stage of the covid-19 outbreak,” says Jihad Azour of the IMF. “Any policy has to be anchored in a very conservative assumption.”

All this borrowing offers limited returns for Arab states. More than 70% of Kuwait’s latest budget is earmarked for public-sector salaries and subsidies. It is taking on debt not to fund reforms but to sustain a bloated bureaucracy. Arab states have also been stingy with their covid-19 stimulus packages. They have allocated an average of 2% of GDP for pandemic-related help, compared with 3% for all emerging markets, in part because of limited fiscal firepower.

Borrowing has helped them cope, but it also exacerbates this problem (Egypt already spends an estimated 9% of GDP on debt service). Oil prices are projected to stay low next year, and vital industries like tourism will be slow to recover. Heavier debt loads will limit how much Arab governments can jolt their sluggish economies.",11/1/20 0:00,
The valleys of the shadow of death - Italian towns hit hardest by covid-19 are doing better now,"O NE OF THE most pressing questions about covid-19 is how achievable “herd immunity” may be. Holding other factors constant, the more people have protective antibodies, the slower the virus spreads. If enough people become and remain immune, further outbreaks are prevented.

Some experts have advised letting the young and healthy get covid-19, in order to approach such herd immunity. European data suggest this goal remains distant: within countries, the regions with the most cases in the spring also tend to have the biggest outbreaks now. Yet broad averages can obscure local variation. And new Italian data show that the worst-hit places do now enjoy some degree of immunity.

Like a tornado, covid-19 has walloped some towns while sparing others. In Lombardy, the heart of Italy’s first wave, 83% more people died of all causes from March to June than the historical average, an excess representing 0.3% of the population. Yet some pockets of the region were hit disproportionately. The rate was 0.6% of the population in Bergamo province, and more than 1% in 30 of Bergamo’s 243 municipalities. If anywhere has enough antibodies to restrain covid-19, it would be these towns.

Lombardy’s government does not share case counts for every area. But Isaia Invernizzi, a journalist, has gained access to its internal data, which show that the hardest-hit towns are doing unusually well today. Since September 1st, municipalities with first-wave excess deaths of at least 0.5% of the population have tallied 216 cases per 100,000 people—one-third as many as in areas with excess deaths around 0.1%.

Social distancing has also slowed the virus. According to Google, Lombards moved around 24% less in July than in January, the steepest drop in Italy. But this decline has been similar in all of Lombardy. That leaves immunity as the best explanation for differences in case counts within the region.

These data do not prove the case for seeking herd immunity. Without a vaccine, the cost of gaining even mild resistance is grim. No national study has found a share of people with antibodies even one-third as high as the 24% seen in Bergamo in July. And Europe’s highest national excess death rate, in Spain, is just a fifth of Bergamo’s.

Yet for beleaguered Bergamasques, the data are good news. Serosurveys show that antibodies there are not only common, but especially so among the old and health-care workers, who need them most. ■

Busking for bail-outs - Covid-19 is forcing the arts in Europe back into the arms of government,"W EARING A LONG robe and a silver plastic crown, Cameron Burg was dancing on a Swiss mountaintop with a pair of DJ s and several hundred ecstatic electronica fans. Behind him, bubble-cars were disgorging men in leather jackets and women in face paint. It was mid-September and Caprices, a dance-music festival in Crans-Montana, had just kicked off after a five-month delay. It had been cancelled by covid-19, along with the rest of Europe’s electronica festivals, and fans were suffering withdrawal. “After a while you miss the PLUR ,” said Mr Burg, using a ravers’ shorthand for peace, love, unity and respect.

Chalets and restaurants in Crans-Montana count on Caprices, which usually draws 6,000 festival-goers in April, to fill the gap between the end of the ski season and the start of the golf and mountain-biking ones. When the festival was postponed, local businesses reworked it to satisfy health authorities, limiting it to 1,000 guests divided into three zones. In August they got the go-ahead. They also got more than SFr100,000 ($110,200) in government subsidies and loans.

In Europe, where there is culture, there is government. Orchestras and museums have long relied on state, not private, sponsorship. Theatres and art festivals are often owned or bankrolled by municipalities. Audiovisual ventures benefit from film funds and state broadcasters. Spending on cultural services runs to about 1% of the total government budget in the average EU country. An exact comparison is hard to find, but in America 0.7% of government spending goes to cultural services, recreation and religion; in France and Germany that figure is 2.3%.

Covid-19 hit this cheerful scene like the last act of Götterdämmerung, even before this week’s news of fresh lockdowns on Germany and France. Exhibitions and live events have had to close or restrict admissions. In France output in the culture sector is expected to shrink by 25% in 2020, compared with a drop in overall GDP of 8.7%. Germany expects GDP to fall by 5.8% and cultural output to contract by 13-23%. Governments have responded with emergency spending to keep the arts from collapsing, tying them even closer to the state.

Take Germany. For years its government has pressed cultural institutions to privatise, with only modest results. Covid has pushed in the opposite direction. In June the federal government announced a €1bn “Restart Culture” programme, including €250m to help private institutions like cinemas and theatres with social distancing, €50m for various arts funds and €20m for dance. On top of that, the culture ministry’s budget for 2021 will rise by €120m, or 6.6%. Germany’s states are helping too: North Rhine-Westphalia has set up an €80m covid-19 culture fund, significantly more than its normal annual culture budget.

France’s interventions are even bigger, some €5bn to the end of 2021. Fully €950m goes to shore up a peculiar French institution: intermittents du spectacle, part-time performers and technicians who are the backbone of many shows, and get government pay when they have no work. Since the cancellation of nearly all live events makes it impossible to amass enough hours to qualify, the government has waived the minimums until August 31st 2021. Billions more are budgeted for loans to cultural establishments and reimbursement for projects that cannot be staged.

In the Netherlands, arts institutions have been cutting staff for decades, while liberal governments have provided tax incentives to go freelance. Almost 50% of Dutch in the culture sector are now self-employed, compared with a third in Germany. When covid-19 hit, that caused problems: whereas the Dutch government guaranteed furloughed workers 80% of their salaries, freelancers got only €1,050 per month. Meanwhile drama companies and orchestras faced bankruptcy, which would leave the cities that own the country’s magnificent concert halls and theatres with no tenants to pay the rent. To fend that off, the centre-left D 66 party pushed through two spending packages for the culture sector totalling €700m, nearly doubling the ministry’s budget.

Not all the responses to the virus have been defensive. When Italy’s centre-left Democratic Party replaced the hard-right Northern League party in government last year, it revived a scheme to liberate the country’s museums from central control. That persuaded Eike Schmidt, the German director of Florence’s Uffizi Gallery, to stay on rather than returning to Vienna as he had planned. When the pandemic hit, the museum reopened after a few months by redistributing artworks and visitors to smaller museums in towns throughout Tuscany. Ticket revenues have recovered to within 90% of normal.

Mr Schmidt sees this as an opportunity to spread culture around and shift away from the mega-tourism that has blighted European cities. (“Venice, Florence and Barcelona weren’t constructed as theme parks,” he says.) The virus is forcing other countries to think small, too. Hungary, which under Viktor Orban’s populist rule has become the European country that spends the second-largest share of its budget on culture (2.7%), set up a €14.5m fund for small rock concerts, live-streamed to fans. In the Netherlands, a 30-person audience limit has closed the national theatre in Amsterdam. But avant-garde theatres with lower overheads that are happy to perform to an audience of 30 are soldiering on.

With or without the pandemic, the state’s role in culture was always going to be big in Europe. It is hard to imagine private donors preserving the continent’s spectacular architectural heritage. Symphony orchestras lose money everywhere; America’s corporate sponsorships are partly government subsidies disguised as tax deductions. The Dutch practice of having stage productions tour every midsized town would be impossible without state subsidies for local culture. So would the European landscape of high-art festivals such as those in Avignon, Montreux and Salzburg.

When those festivals will have live audiences again is anyone’s guess, the more so as Europe is now deep in a second wave of covid-19. Caprices was not a promising sign. Between mid-September and mid-October the number of daily new cases in Valais, the canton including Crans-Montana, rose from a dozen to 275. A regional hospital said it had found a link between ten of those who tested positive: they had attended Caprices. ■

Banyan - The pandemic has exposed South-East Asia’s poor governance,"I T HARDLY FOLLOWED the script intended by Thailand’s army-backed government. In the face of growing demonstrations calling for the resignation of the prime minister, a new constitution and a reformed monarchy, on October 15th the government imposed a “severe” state of emergency, banning gatherings of more than five people. Far from being cowed, a formless protest movement morphed into a determined opposition.

Young activists, many still at school, poured onto the streets of Bangkok. They brandished symbols of defiance, such as a three-fingered salute borrowed from the “The Hunger Games”, a dystopian novel, along with flashmob tactics inspired by Hong Kong’s protests. Activists already talk of victory. In a way, they are correct: longstanding taboos, such as one against criticism of the monarchy, have been smashed. The emergency decree was withdrawn on October 22nd.

The indignation felt by the prime minister and former coup leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, and his cronies is palpable—a sense that protests are a gross display of ingratitude. After all, in health terms, the government handled the pandemic remarkably well, with a mere 3,709 covid-19 cases and 59 deaths. Thailand, heavily dependent on tourism, now wants to reopen to visitors. On October 20th the first planeload of Chinese holidaymakers landed in Bangkok.

The protesters, however, see things differently. For a start, they say, weeks of lockdown nurtured a social-media ferment, which exploded in July after restrictions were eased. But above all, the handling of the pandemic notwithstanding, the economic consequences are dire. Thailand’s economy may shrink by nearly 8% this year. Many of over 500,000 university students who graduate in the coming weeks wonder how they will find work. One student says she and her colleagues associate their own pinched prospects with the king’s obscene wealth, kleptocratic elites and other embodiments of lousy governance.

The monarchy and its excesses are unique to Thailand. But the degree to which young people share the same perspective across South-East Asia is striking. In a region whose economy is forecast to shrink by nearly 4% this year, the World Bank warns that covid-19 will have a lasting impact, in particular, on inclusive growth, by hurting investment, human capital and productivity. The Bank predicts that, across East Asia and the Pacific, the number of poor people will rise by 38m; most of those will be in South-East Asia. The worst-hit victims are the young, especially in those countries, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, with large informal sectors.

For South-East Asia, the economic impact of the coronavirus is more serious even than that of the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98. Then, economic distress exposed the region’s dire shortcomings in governance. It brought forth calls, especially among the young, for political change. The crisis ushered in a democratic movement in Thailand. In Indonesia it sowed the seeds for the downfall of Suharto, the aged dictator, and a new, democratic era of reformasi.

Yet the pandemic has laid bare how fitful change has been. In Cambodia the strongman, Hun Sen, holds court like a medieval Khmer king, tolerating graft and locking up critics. In Malaysia, after hopes of reform, governing still involves cronyism, vote-buying and repression (and now the coronavirus is returning with a vengeance).

Indonesia’s health ministry has been so corrupted by embezzlers that when the pandemic struck, it struggled to respond. Its levels of testing are among the lowest in the world. In the Philippines, also notable for its poor handling of the virus, President Rodrigo Duterte has hounded critics, including the vice-president and local media. Now the government ombudsman has decreed that it is not the public’s business to see the declared assets of officials.

Across South-East Asia, elections exist either to entrench power or to offer a turn at the trough; some Filipino congressmen triple their wealth in a three-year term. Not just in Thailand but also in Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia—where street protests are under way against a new law that undermines workers’ rights and the environment—brave young people are speaking out against the old ways. Some divine in this inchoate anger an irresistible force. Can it prove more powerful than the immovable mass of South-East Asia’s kleptocrats, self-serving bureaucrats and strongmen? Well, that is another matter.

The virus and the vector - How covid-19 hinders the fight against malaria,"S INCE COVID-19 hit Kenya, Margaret Wanja has accumulated six grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She lives in Thiba, a rice-growing village. Her new brood are all evacuees from Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. Many city-dwellers believe it is safer to send their children to rural relatives. Others hope to save money. The pandemic has destroyed jobs and closed schools, where poor children are often given a free lunch. Dispatching kids to the countryside, where it is easier to live off the land, means fewer mouths to feed.

Yet there are hidden dangers. The irrigation ditches in Thiba’s paddy fields breed mosquitoes, which transmit malarial parasites from human bloodstream to human bloodstream. So even if there is less coronavirus here than in a city, it is far more dangerous for children. Worldwide, 400,000 people died of malaria in 2018, two-thirds of them children under five. Very few children die of covid-19.

To prevent mosquito bites, governments hand out insecticide-treated bednets. Kenya does it every three years; and was scheduled to do it in April. Alas, covid-19 scotched that plan. Kenya was under curfew, movement was restricted and health workers were on pandemic duty.

Belatedly, as the insecticide on Kenyans’ old bednets loses its potency, the government is trying again. On October 24th hundreds of volunteers began a household census in Mwea, the electoral district that includes Thiba, in preparation for a pilot programme handing out 60,000 nets with social distancing. Instead of rolling up with a truckload and letting villagers crowd around to receive one, workers will have multiple distribution points and staggered pickup times. Getting nets to all 15m Kenyans who live in malarial regions will take ages. There is no chance it will be done before the rainy (ie, malarial) season ends in late November.

As covid-19 started to spread around the world in March, malaria-watchers fretted. Supply chains for drugs and insecticide were bound to be disrupted. Pandemic-induced poverty was bound to make people more vulnerable. “All the alarm bells started ringing,” says Pedro Alonso of the World Health Organisation ( WHO ). In April a WHO study predicted that, in a worst-case scenario, the malarial death toll in sub-Saharan Africa, where the vast majority of fatalities occur, would double in 2020, to 769,000.

Governments and donors were jolted into action. Supply chains were indeed disrupted, but firms found workarounds, and health workers found ways to fight malaria while avoiding spreading covid-19. Some 90% of malaria-prevention efforts are now back on track, says the RBM Partnership to End Malaria. The worst-case scenario now seems unlikely to come to pass, though conclusive data are not yet available.

Still, huge challenges remain. The global death toll from malaria was falling before covid-19 struck (see chart). It would be a tragedy if progress stalled, especially since, as Philip Welkhoff of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation notes, “Every malaria death is avoidable.”

Governments in rich countries have pushed a consistent message for covid-19. If your children have a fever, keep them at home. “That message would be an unmitigated disaster in countries with high malaria transmission, because a child with a fever can die from malaria in 24 hours,” says Melanie Renshaw of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, an intergovernmental group. Such a child must quickly be tested for malaria and, if the test is positive, be given anti-malarial drugs. In recent years donors have done a good job of distributing rapid diagnostic tests. These plastic devices look like pregnancy tests, only smaller. They can detect malaria within 15 minutes, with just a drop of blood and no need for a doctor. However, each test can be used only once, so donors have to keep supplying millions of them to African villages. Some of the difficulties health workers face can be seen at El Miskin camp, near Maiduguri in northern Nigeria. Rows of small square houses of thatch and tarpaulin stretch into the distance. Kids mill around. There’s a hand-washing station at the entrance, but no water or soap. The people in the camp are among the 2m who have fled from Boko Haram, a slave-owning jihadist group. Because they are poor and their camp is puddle-pocked, they are vulnerable to malaria. At one tarpaulin house Nana, a mother, grinds orange pills in water and presses the cup to her son’s lips. Hussein, who is about four years old, grimaces at the bitter taste. The yucky pills were given to his family as part of a campaign of “seasonal malaria chemoprevention”. In the rainy season, when mosquitoes proliferate, children under five who live in the most malarial areas of Africa are given a prophylactic cocktail of drugs once a month. It cuts the likelihood of each child falling sick by 75%. It has helped Nigeria reduce malaria deaths from 153,000 in 2010 to 95,000 in 2018. Many locals do not believe in covid-19, or dismiss it as a disease only for rich people who fly in planes. Despite numerous warnings, they crowd hazardously around the health workers who come to the camps. Those health workers must haul around bags of masks and sanitisers. This costs a lot; and the masks create a psychological barrier between health workers and ordinary people, frets Ini Nglass, who leads a WHO malaria team in Borno, the state of which Maiduguri is the capital. Masked people at the door look intimidating. And whereas health workers would normally laugh and play with children before dishing out pills, this year they stand a metre away, their reassuring smiles hidden.

This makes it harder to build trust, and that matters in north-eastern Nigeria, where suspicion is rife. Some 1.2m people are trapped in areas controlled by Boko Haram. The jihadists oppose modernity (though they cheerfully brandish modern weapons). In 2018 they murdered two Red Cross midwives, for supposedly betraying Islam by joining a Western charity.

They make it dangerous to save lives. Yet some health workers manage to distribute anti-malarial drugs. They disguise themselves as villagers, sneak into jihadist territory, stay put for weeks or months and only leave when the work is done. The WHO calls them “trapped health workers”.

When it is too risky to sneak in, they try a different ploy. Boko Haram’s subjects are not allowed to leave permanently. But they can make short trips to market towns, so long as they leave something valuable behind. “[Boko Haram] take their children and tell them, ‘If you don’t come back, we will kill them,’” says a local observer. So health workers station themselves at markets and, with the help of local informants, make contact with the villagers for long enough to slip them anti-malarial pills.

It feels odd to work in the shadows, like heroin dealers, but such tactics are effective. In August Africa was declared free of the wild polio virus, despite the efforts of Boko Haram to thwart vaccination campaigns, which its fighters imagine are a plot to sterilise Muslims.

Some places cannot be reached, alas. Of the 27 local government areas in Borno state, two have been struck off the anti-malarial campaign’s list. They are on the borders with Niger and Chad, which the terrorists cross at will, so they are too dangerous. No one knows how many children will die of malaria because the jihadists think science is sinful. Most Africans disagree with Boko Haram. In a laboratory in Dakar, Senegal’s capital, technicians analyse the malarial parasites found in people’s blood. Genetic information is fed into computers and crunched. “Before genomics arrived, there were questions without answers,” says Daouda Ndiaye, Senegal’s top malaria expert, based at Cheikh Anta Diop University. There is a correlation between the number of different parasites found in human blood samples and the prevalence of malaria itself. If only one kind of parasite is found in the samples from a given village, there may be only one source of infection. (The villagers are infecting each other.) Multiple different parasites suggests multiple sources of infection: traders crossing a border, migrant workers coming home and so on. People on buses travel much farther than mosquitoes can fly.

A mix of old and new

Genomics yields precious information. It can show how the disease is being transmitted around the country, and where infection rates are likely to be high. This lets health authorities concentrate resources where they are most needed. It can also show where drug-resistant strains of malaria have popped up, so medics can change the drugs they recommend in those places.

By combining new tools with bednets, pills and spraying, Senegal hopes to eliminate malaria by 2030. Ending it worldwide is further off. The Lancet, a medical journal, said last year that it could be done within a generation, if $6bn a year were spent on prevention instead of $4.3bn. The covid-driven global recession could make it harder to raise such sums.

Anti-malarial campaigns must be sustained. “If you stop holding it down, it goes back up,” says Dr Welkhoff. An Asian species of mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, has found a foothold in Ethiopia and Sudan. Unlike most African species, it thrives in cities, where previously the disease was rare. Since mosquitoes and parasites move and evolve, people must be adaptable. Mosquitoes are being genetically modified to sire offspring that die before they are old enough to start biting. In October the WHO came out in favour of such research. Victory against the vectors is not assured, but nor is it fanciful. ■

Correction (October 30th 2020): A previous version of this article stated that in a worst-case scenario, the malarial death toll would nearly double in 2020. In fact, the malarial death toll in sub-saharan Africa would double in that scenario.

Going full circuit - Britain should not resort to a new national lockdown,"Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hub

I N ONE SENSE it marks the return of politics as usual; in another it is a sign of looming crisis. On October 13th Britain’s opposition Labour Party split sharply from the government, calling for a “circuit-breaker”, a two- or three-week national lockdown to cut the spread of covid-19. As Europe and America struggle with a surge in cases, other governments may also come under pressure to do the same. It would be a mistake. The benefits of a national lockdown no longer justify the costs. At this stage of the pandemic governments should focus on local measures.

The impulse to do something is understandable. New reported daily cases in Britain are at a record seven-day average of over 15,000 and are doubling every two weeks. Local leaders are angered by confusing orders from Whitehall (see article). No wonder Labour has seized on Boris Johnson’s faltering performance.

Backers of a short, sharp lockdown say it would save lives—perhaps 7,000 or so according to modelling for scientists advising the government. By cutting the virus’s spread, the National Health Service would be spared the sort of overload that caused so many deaths in Italy earlier in the year. Once the epidemic had been reset at a lower level, the tracing system might be able to deal more promptly with the daily burden of new cases, helping to lower the rate of infections.

A national lockdown makes sense only if a country is completely overwhelmed and underprepared—as at the start of the pandemic. Neither is true of Britain today. Although the recorded number of cases in Britain is over three times its peak in April, the comparison is misleading. For all the system’s faults, the daily volume of tests is over 20 times what it was then. Mild cases that would have gone unreported six months ago are now picked up (see chart). This helps explain why deaths, at around 450 last week, are still just 8% of what they were in April. The fatality rate will increase, because it lags behind cases by three to four weeks. But better treatments are also saving lives. In choosing to act, deaths are more important than cases.",10/17/20 0:00,

The Democratic ticket

Kamala Harris, you claim, “comes from the Democratic Party’s centre”, is “not particularly ideological”, and never strays “too far from where a majority of voters are” (“What Kamala says about Joe”, August 15th). Her voting record in the Senate indicates otherwise. According to UCLA ’s VoteView website, Ms Harris’s votes are more left-leaning than that of any other senator, except Elizabeth Warren. Her voting record is further to the left than even Bernie Sanders, the only avowed socialist in the Senate.

Your otherwise excellent leader repeated a general misunderstanding about life expectancy. For an American male at birth, life expectancy is 76 years. But at Joe Biden’s age, 77, a male can expect to live an extra ten years. So Mr Biden is statistically very likely to live out a four-year term, at least.

DR DEBORAH HAMMOND

Tacoma, Washington

It might be true that if Mr Biden loses in November, Ms Harris “would be first in line next time round” for the Democratic nomination in 2024. History suggests otherwise. Of all the vice-presidential candidates on a losing ticket in the past 50 years only two went on to be nominated by their party for president: Walter Mondale, who had actually served as veep, and Bob Dole, and he had to wait 20 years (from 1976, when he was on the losing ticket with Gerald Ford, to 1996, when he won the Republican nomination).

Whichever way you slice it

Your leader calling for more resources to support vaccine research for the coronavirus gave the analogy that if a person needed to eat pizza to survive he would over-order pizza, so some would go to waste (“A bigger dose”, August 8th). The analogy is flawed.

Eating pizza, even for survival, is a classic private good. But funding for vaccine research is fundamentally different. Increased spending on vaccines means that we will finance some failures, but the knowledge that such failures gives us is incredibly valuable. Support for research is not like an insurance policy of over-ordering pizza to make sure everyone is fed. It is actually a productive investment given the public-good of scientific knowledge. The knowledge, unlike uneaten pizza, won’t go to waste.

Britain doesn’t rule the waves

With reference to fishing rights in the UK - EU trade negotiations (“On the menu”, July 25th) it is worth emphasising that under international law, Britain can never revert to becoming an independent coastal state. This nationalistic trope was eagerly seized upon by Brexiteers. Unfortunately for them there is a binding international treaty obligation on post-Brexit Britain to allow any surplus fisheries within the United Kingdom’s 200 nautical mile exclusive economic (fishing) zone to be shared with fishermen from other countries, especially those who have traditionally fished in British waters.

This obligation is contained within the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Non-compliance may result in the British government being brought before a Conciliation Commission. While conciliation sounds friendly, a similar commission established as a result of an application by the tiny state of East Timor ultimately led to mighty Australia being compelled to negotiate a maritime boundary treaty that, inter alia, provides for the equitable sharing of any offshore hydrocarbon resources found in the seabed between these two countries.

It is hardly satisfying to think that much of the supposed Brexit dividend will now probably need to be spent on more maritime enforcement vessels.

Postmen’s pensions

“Law of the letter” (August 8th) reported on the state of the United States Postal Service and highlighted a simple truth about financial transparency: the cost of defined-benefit retirement plans for public-sector workers is unknowable. Costs generally exceed forecasts and returns generally lag behind them, so initial estimates are often too low. Since defined-benefit plans kick the can of the liability into the future, the full cost of funding those pensions becomes someone else’s problem.

Defined-contribution plans, however, make the cost transparent today. Understanding true costs will help public-sector organisations like the post office price their services better to promote a sustainable business model.

The greenshoe option

Buttonwood perpetuated a common misunderstanding of the greenshoe option when he said that in an initial public offering “the banks retain the right to issue more stock to ‘stabilise’ the market”, and echoed complaints that this is a “rapacious practice” (August 1st). In fact, the greenshoe option was designed as a stop-loss option for underwriters, who over-allot shares of up to 15% in the new issue (go short) in order to “stabilise the market” in the immediate aftermath of an IPO .

They do this by buying any stock from the IPO that might “come back” and put pressure on the share price, thereby covering their short position. The expectation is that there will be a bid, by the underwriters, at or close to issue price for 30 days. So, if stock is offered back at prices below the issue price, the underwriters can cover their short position and sop up loose stock. However, as we all know, if the share price goes up rather than down, the underwriters lose on their short position and the potential loss is unlimited.

The greenshoe option gives the underwriters the right to buy more shares from the company’s “treasury” (not sell investors more shares than initially planned) in order to cover their short position. It was created to ensure that underwriters do not lose money in providing this valuable service. That is only fair.

What is not fair, and what annoys issuers, is when the stock softens in the after-market and the underwriters fail to provide support in the market, preferring to wait for 30 days and exercise the option. Underwriters do this because it is more profitable for them to buy from the company’s treasury than to buy from the market.

"There's no alternative to lockdown, Boris Johnson tells MPs","Boris Johnson has sought to persuade mutinous Conservative backbenchers to support his plan for a new coronavirus lockdown across England, saying that failing to act now would risk the “medical and moral disaster” of an overwhelmed NHS.

Addressing the Commons about his plans for a four-week shutdown starting on Thursday, the prime minister also rejected the idea he had been too slow to act, saying it had been right to first try a regional system of different tiers of restrictions.

But in response, Keir Starmer accused Johnson of consistently being “too slow and behind the curve” in his decisions on Covid, which amounted to a significant failure of leadership.

While Labour has pledged to back the new measures in the Commons, all but guaranteeing they will pass, a number of Conservatives have expressed opposition to the planned closure of hospitality businesses and most retail, among other temporary rules.

But Johnson said scientific predictions about the “remorseless advance of this second wave” meant the lockdown was inevitable.

“Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action, at a national level,” he told MPs. “I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership.

“And I reject any suggestion that we are somehow slower in taking measures than our European friends and partners.”

Directly addressing the Tory malcontents, Johnson said: “To those in this house who believe we should resist further national measures, let me spell out the medical and moral disaster we face.”

This would he said, lead the the “disaster” of the NHS being overwhelmed, affecting not just coronavirus patients, but those with other ailments and needs.

He said: “The sick would be turned away because there was no room in hospitals. That sacred principle of care for anyone who needs it, whoever they are, and wherever, whenever they need it, could be broken for the first time in our lives.

“Doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die.”

In response, some MPs said they would vote against the measures on Wednesday. Charles Walker, the senior backbencher who represents Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, said a negative vote was his only way of dissenting “as we drift further in to an authoritarian, coercive state”.

Another senior backbencher, Bernard Jenkin, said he would back “the bitter medicine” from the prime minister, saying: “Nobody has put forward a viable, immediate alternative that would avoid the overwhelming of the NHS.”

Jenkin asked Johnson to commission a white paper to set out a “plan for living with coronavirus”, and called for a revamp of the test-and-trace system, including a new boss to replace Dido Harding.

Johnson also sought to reassure his critics, saying support for self-employed people would be doubled from 40% to 80% of trading profits. This was, he said, not “the full-scale lockdown of March and April”, and he guaranteed parliament a vote on what happens next when the regulations expire on 2 December.

Quick guide What you can and can't do in England's new national Covid lockdown Show Hide New national restrictions are due to come into effect in England on Thursday, after MPs vote on them, and remain in place at least until 2 December. What can I leave home for? For childcare or education, where it is not provided online.

To go to work unless it can be done from home.

Outdoor exercise either with household members or with one person from another household.

For all medical reasons and appointments.

To escape injury or harm, such as domestic abuse.

To provide care for vulnerable people or volunteer.

To shop for food and essentials.

To see people in your support bubble.

Children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. Government say the list is not exhaustive, and other permitted reasons for leaving home may be set out later. People could face fines from police for leaving their home without a legally permitted excuse. Can different households mix indoors? No, not unless they are part of an “exclusive” support bubble, which allows a single-person household to meet and socialise with another household. Parents are allowed to form a childcare bubble with another household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is 13 or under. Can different households mix outdoors? People are allowed to meet one person from another household socially and for exercise in outdoor public spaces, which does not include private gardens. Can I attend funerals, weddings or religious services? Up to 30 people will still be allowed to attend funerals, while stone settings and ash scatterings can continue with up to 15 guests. Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies are not permitted except in “exceptional circumstances”. Places of worship must remain closed except for voluntary services, individual prayer and other exempt activities. Can I travel in the UK or abroad for a holiday? Most outbound international travel will be banned. There is no exemption for staying away from home for a holiday. This means people cannot travel internationally or within the UK, unless for work, education or other legally permitted exemptions. Which businesses will close? Everything except essential shops and education settings, which include nurseries, schools and universities, will close. Entertainment venues will also have to close. Pubs, restaurants and indoor and outdoor leisure facilities will have to close their doors once more. However, takeaway and delivery services will still be allowed, while construction and manufacturing will stay open. Parents will still be able to access registered childcare and other childcare activities where reasonably necessary to enable parents to work. Some youth services may be able to continue, such as one-to-one youth work, but most youth clubs will need to close their doors. Public services, such as jobcentres, courts, and civil registration offices will remain open. There is no exemption for grassroots organised team sports. Elite sports will be allowed to continue behind closed doors as currently, including Premier League football matches. Aaron Walawalkar

But Starmer – who had advocated a two-week “circuit-breaker” lockdown coinciding with the just-ended half term – said the delay meant the measures would need to be longer and tougher.

“At every stage the prime minister has been too slow and behind the curve,” the Labour leader said. “At every stage, he has pushed away challenge, ignored advice and put what he hoped would happen ahead of what is happening. At every stage he has over-promised and under-delivered.”

Starmer said Johnson’s decision to reject the advice from his scientific advisers in September that a circuit breaker was needed amounted to “a catastrophic failure of leadership and of judgment”.",11/2/20 0:00,
The lockdown rebels preparing to defy No 10 on Covid restrictions,"As England braces for a second national lockdown, Downing Street once more faces a rebellion over tougher restrictions. Ahead of a Commons vote on Wednesday, several Conservative MPs are weighing up their options. Here are some key figures who may line up against the government and the broad camps they sit in, alongside Nigel Farage and his plan for a new anti-lockdown party.

The hawks

Sir Graham Brady

The chair of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs is again a thorn in the side of the government, urging Boris Johnson to publish a full impact assessment on the costs and benefits of another lockdown. “We need clarity as to the years of life that will be lost or saved, the impact on mental health and the consequences for quality of life,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

Brady, who successfully spearheaded a rebellion ensuring parliament got a vote on new nationwide restrictions before they are imposed, says any return to regional tiers or an extension of lockdown beyond 2 December must be approved in advance by MPs.

Reflecting on restrictions over the past seven months, Brady added: “If a totalitarian regime sought to tell people with whom they are allowed to have sex (you must be in an established relationship), whether you are allowed to visit your parents, or which categories of workers are allowed to provide for their families, we would denounce it as intolerable evil.”

Sir John Redwood

The former Conservative cabinet minister has publicly questioned what the exit strategy is for lockdown. Tweeting on Monday, Redwood said: “The proposed lockdown will be damaging to livelihoods and business. The government should work with business to allow more to stay open … Why won’t the government advisers and NHS management give us believable forecasts rather than hugely wide and some wild illustrations of worst cases? Where are the accurate figures for NHS bed occupancy? How do they now define a CV 19 death?”

The regional-lockdown pushers

Iain Duncan Smith

The former Tory party leader believes England should have kept with the regional tiered lockdown strategy. “Trying, as far as possible, to keep the economy open whilst focusing on those areas with the highest infection rates wasn’t a perfect solution, but it kept people’s hopes up. Now those hopes have been dashed,” he wrote for the Daily Mail.

“I still feel, after seeing the Sage data, that we should have stuck with this plan – even increasing, if necessary, the levels of action in specific areas, as is now happening in Scotland. It seems harsh to punish the whole of England when many areas could be at tier levels which might well bring this under control.”

Regarding Wednesday’s vote, he said: “I will need to be certain that the data is fair and accurate, leaving no other alternative, before supporting such a drastic step as full lockdown.”

The veteran backbencher said the government’s localised approach to lockdowns “made a lot of sense”, telling the BBC: “Lock down in areas where the disease is very bad, but not in other areas – don’t wreck other areas where it’s not necessary. And I’m not quite sure why we’ve abandoned that, because there’s lots of areas in the UK which don’t have a problem at the moment.”

Bone, who has not decided how he will vote on Wednesday, highlighted concerns about another lockdown and called Brady’s suggestion that an impact assessment be published “very sensible”.

The libertarians

Nigel Farage

The most openly anti-lockdown political voice is now coming from the former Ukip leader, who announced on Monday he was rebranding his later vehicle, the Brexit party, as Reform UK with an initial plan to seek an alternative path on Covid.

In a Telegraph article this weekend, Farage formally supported the Great Barrington Declaration – the proposal from an international group of scientists to allow younger and healthy people to return to normal life, while shielding the more vulnerable.

This has been disparaged by many epidemiologists, who say the idea of achieving “herd immunity” without a vaccine is unrealistic, not least given the doubts about how long Covid immunity lasts. With a general election years away, Farage seems likely at some point to rebrand Reform UK as a more general rightwing populist party, focusing on areas such as immigration, crime, and culture-war issues.

Esther McVey

The former cabinet minister has come out against a new lockdown, saying she will vote against the measure on Wednesday. McVey wrote on Instagram: “The ‘lockdown cure’ is causing more harm than Covid. The world can not be put on hold, and the government must stop pressing the pause and stop button for the whole nation on a whim, with all the disastrous effects this brings to our lives, livelihoods, health and relationships.”",11/2/20 0:00,
Coronavirus live news: Germany goes into 'lockdown light'; Italy accused of wasting time as infections rise,"18:04

In the final hours before election day, one of Donald Trump’s closing messages to Americans is an unsubstantiated threat: that a Joe Biden presidency will result in a national Covid-19 lockdown.

Speaking in Iowa on Sunday, the president said the election was a “choice between a deadly Biden lockdown … or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic”.

Coronavirus cases are surging in the US and most battleground states are particularly badly affected. On Friday, the total case count surpassed 9m while the daily count set a new world record, at about 100,000. On Sunday 81,493 new cases were reported, according to Johns Hopkins University, and 447 new deaths. Nearly 231,000 people have died.

In Iowa, painting a dark and dystopian vision, Trump told a crowd of closely packed supporters, many not wearing masks: “The Biden plan will turn America into a prison state locking you down, while letting the far-left rioters roam free to loot and burn.”

That came after he told a rally in Pennsylvania, another swing state, there would be “no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Christmas, no Easters, no Fourth of Julys” under a Biden administration.

In an interview in August, Biden was asked if he would shut the US down if scientists said he should do so. He said: “I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists.” Biden has since clarified that he was referring to whether he would follow advice, saying: “There’s going to be no need, in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy.”

In October, Biden said: “I don’t think there’s a need to lock down.”",11/2/20 0:00,
Slovakia carries out Covid mass testing of two-thirds of population,"Country aims to be one of first to test entire population of 5.4 million people for virus

Two-thirds of Slovakia’s population of 5.4 million people were tested for coronavirus over the weekend as part of a programme aimed at making it one of the first countries to test its entire population.

Antigen tests were carried out on 3.625 million people – of whom 38,359, or 1.06%, were found to be positive.

“We have made a great leap forward,” the prime minister, Igor Matovič, told reporters.

“But we should not think that because of this 1%, now all is fine. It is not,” he added. “In reality, up to 2% of our inhabitants might be infected. It is not at all a good situation.”

Antigen tests give far quicker results than PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) tests, which involve nasal swabs that have to be sent to a laboratory, but they are less reliable.

A further round of tests has been scheduled for next weekend.

Participation is not mandatory but anyone who is not able to produce a negative test certificate if stopped by police could be fined. Anyone who tests positive will have to go immediately into quarantine for 10 days.

Slovakia wants to be one of the first countries in the world to test its entire population. Smaller countries such as Luxembourg have already done so, as have some Chinese cities with larger populations than Slovakia, such as Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated from.

The government has hinted that virus restrictions could be eased once testing is complete, or reinforced if the programme is not carried out in full.

Like other countries, Slovakia has seen a sharp rise in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, although it is still below the EU average. On Monday, it reported 1,883 new cases, bringing the tally to 61,829.

A total of 219 people in Slovakia have died from the virus.

The programme has come under criticism for being poorly thought through, however. The Slovak Association of General Practitioners said the high concentration of people at testing sites was “at odds with the recommendations of infectious disease experts”.",11/2/20 0:00,
Global coronavirus report: WHO chief self-isolates as Germany starts 'wave breaker' lockdown,"New restrictions have begun across Europe, many greeted by protests

The head of the World Health Organization has gone into self-quarantine after someone he had been in contact with tested positive for Covid-19.

With the virus again spreading rapidly across Europe and elsewhere, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is based in Geneva, made the announcement by Twitter late on Sunday night, but stressed he had no symptoms.

“I have been identified as a contact of someone who has tested positive for Covid-19,” Tedros said in his tweet.

Half of Slovakia's population tested for coronavirus in one day Read more

“I am well and without symptoms but will self-quarantine over the coming days, in line with @WHO protocols, and work from home,” he added.

Tedros has been at the forefront of the UN health agency’s efforts to battle the pandemic, which has claimed the lives of 1.2 million and infected more than 46.6 million people worldwide since emerging in China late last year, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.

He stressed on Twitter that “it is critically important that we all comply with health guidance. This is how we will break chains of Covid-19 transmission, suppress the virus, and protect health systems.”

Countries across Europe reintroduced or strengthened existing lockdown measures on Monday.

Germany went into “lockdown light” mode, with bars, cinemas, theatres, museums, fitness studios and swimming pools closing and cafes and restaurants allowed to offer takeaway food only. Meetings in public have been restricted to two households or no more than 10 people. Unlike during the first lockdown in the spring, schools and nurseries will stay open.

The new “wave breaker” restrictions will for now only apply until the end of the month, but the government is not ruling out an extension. On Sunday, the health minister, Jens Spahn, called on the public to prepare for “months of restrictions and abstinence”.

The chancellor, Angela Merkel, told a news conference on Monday that Germany was still some way off an end to the pandemic but if people respected the restrictions over the next four weeks “then we will be able to have the conditions for a tolerable December.”

“Throughout the winter months, we will have to limit private contacts,” Merkel said. “The light at the end of the tunnel is still quite a long way off.”

Italy will tighten its restrictions but is holding back from reintroducing a nationwide lockdown, its prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said, as infections, hospital admissions and deaths rise.

Conte told Italy’s parliament tougher measures, including curbing travel between the worst-hit regions and a night-time curfew, were now needed.

Italy’s daily tally of infections has increased tenfold over the last month and hovered around 30,000 in the last few days, while hospital admissions, intensive care occupancy and deaths have also risen steeply.

“Despite our efforts … the evolution of the epidemic in the last few days is very worrying,” Conte said, adding that intensive care units would be overwhelmed in 15 of Italy’s 20 regions by next month unless tougher action was taken.

“We must intervene with more stringent measures,” he told the Chamber of Deputies, saying the country would be divided into three areas depending on the risk level, with certain places facing tighter restrictions than others.

Meanwhile, Portugal’s prime minister, António Costa, asked the country’s president to declare a state of emergency as a preventive measure to fight the spread of the virus

The last Covid-19 state of emergency, which under Portuguese law is limited to 15 days but can be extended indefinitely in 15-day periods if necessary, was declared by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in March and lasted six weeks.

“It is a critical moment and declaring the … emergency will reinforce the civic awareness of the sanitary emergency we are facing,” Costa told reporters, adding the move was likely to last much longer than 15 days.

The president was expected to proclaim the emergency in a televised address on Monday evening and then parliament would then have to enact it – both are considered formalities.

The weekend was marked by street protests against further restrictions on daily life, including in Italy and Spain, where the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called for an end to “the violent and irrational behaviour” of a minority of people after demonstrations against the government’s decision to declare a six-month state of emergency.

On Sunday night more than 300 people gathered in the centre of São Paulo, Brazil, to protest against state governor João Doria’s support for mandatory Covid-19 immunisation and testing the potential vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac. The country’s health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, who is ill with Covid, remained in hospital on Sunday night after having been discharged from a civilian facility earlier in the day.

Anti-science sentiment was also on display in the US, where supporters of Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Florida on Sunday night began chanting “Fire Fauci” – and the president hinted that he may do so after the election.

The hostility towards Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s leading expert on infectious diseases, comes after he angered the White House by warning that the coming winter would see the virus continue to spread. Two weeks ago, Trump suggested that Fauci was an “idiot”.

"Covid lockdowns are cost of self-isolation failures, says WHO expert","Lockdowns affecting entire populations is a price countries pay for failing to ensure people with coronavirus and their contacts self-isolate, according to an expert from the World Health Organization.

The WHO does not recommend that countries enter lockdowns. It has consistently said that the key to controlling epidemics, whether Covid-19, Sars or flu, is to test people, trace their contacts and ensure all those who are positive or who have been close to those infected are quarantined.

While countries like the UK have been massively increasing the numbers of tests carried out, contact tracing has fallen short, and studies have shown that as few as 20% of people in England fully comply with self-isolation.

“For me, the big missing link in what’s going on in many European countries is management of isolation,” said Dr Margaret Harris of the WHO. “That’s not just isolation of people who are sick – it’s isolation of people who have contacts and are first-degree contacts.

“They don’t think they have Covid, because they feel fine, and even if they are told they should stay home, they don’t feel a strong social obligation or they do not necessarily have that reinforced as happens in some countries.

“So for instance, in a place like Hong Kong, you would be called every day, or the police come to your house,” she said.

Across Asia, there is a mixture of economies that have managed the virus well – not just those that may be non-liberal, non-democratic command economies, she added. “Taiwan, for instance, probably has the best management. They are definitely a highly liberal society.”

A lockdown which effectively isolates everyone does work, Harris said, “but it also causes massive dislocation, massive disruption. And unless you’ve worked out how you can possibly put that pause button on and maintain your economic and social lives, the price you pay is very, very high.”

The WHO doesn’t say don’t do it, she said. “We just say, if you’re doing it, you’re paying a very high price, so therefore get some return for what you pay.”

That means getting test and trace to work efficiently “and you could think very hard about how to make self-isolation doable” she said.

“You’ve got to do it at grassroots level, because it’s very different, say, in London from somewhere rural, it’s different in housing estates, you may have people living on the streets, you may have people living in institutions. So, you have to really know your society, and know how you’re going to make it possible for them to self-isolate.

“There will be people who cannot possibly self-isolate, because they live in crowded conditions or on the streets. You may have to think of offering them somewhere else to stay.

“It does require a lot of planning. It requires a lot of a great deal of partnership with community and with local authorities, and really listening to your mayors and your councils and all the people in your local groups or your NGOs who understand how communities really function and ensure that you’re reaching everyone.

“You might have communities who don’t have access to standard English-language channels and all the rest of it, and don’t really know what is being asked of them or whether it’s possible.”

Harris said that some places, such as Hong Kong, isolate those who have Covid-19 by putting them in hospital with even mild symptoms, which means it is far easier and quicker to spot those who deteriorate and treat them, saving lives. Early medical monitoring helped with getting people the right treatment, she added, and although it’s not yet clear, getting earlier care to people could also save some from the after-effects known as long Covid.",11/2/20 0:00,
What is the science behind England's second national lockdown?,"PM was presented with some alarming data – with one model forecasting up to 4,000 Covid deaths a day next month

England is preparing to enter a second national lockdown after scientific advisers warned that coronavirus infections and the numbers of people in hospital are rising steeply in many areas of the country. But what is the science behind the decision?

What data prompted the lockdown?

The prime minister and two leading advisers, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientist, and Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, made the case for a second national lockdown with a haul of data. They began with the rate of new infections, around 50,000 cases per day, according to the Office for National Statistics, but noted that an infection survey run by Imperial College, London, points to nearer 100,000 cases per day. They showed daily hospital admissions and deaths rising since the end of August. Medium-term projections from the modelling subgroup of the government’s scientific advisers, Sage, found that admissions could surpass those in the first wave by the end of November, with the death rate hitting 800 per day a week later. With no further action, hospital bed capacity would be overrun in December.

How robust is the data?

The data on infections and deaths is by no means perfect, but it was other data that caused most alarm. The advisers presented new modelling from several academic groups on the number of daily deaths England might expect from now until next summer. Many of the groups, such as Imperial College and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, predicted deaths rise to around 2,000 a day by the end of the year. Most striking was modelling from Cambridge University and Public Health England, which suggested 4,000 deaths per day in December. The figure has come under intense scrutiny which has highlighted the provisional nature of many modelling studies.

The Cambridge model differed from the others in important ways. While there are claims that the model looked at deaths 60 days after a positive test rather than the more common 28 days, this is incorrect. There is another reason the model was an outlier. The modelling, performed three weeks ago, used data on coronavirus deaths to infer how rife infections were when the people who died became infected some weeks earlier.

This infection rate, and the consequent deaths, were then projected forwards to February. The approach meant that the model showed how the epidemic six or more weeks ago might look if it continued to rage unabated. This led to a substantial overestimation of daily deaths.

Fed with recent data, the model is far more in line with the others Sage uses, with all estimating roughly 1,000 deaths per day by mid-December if no more is done to contain the virus. The models all point to the number of people in hospital and deaths exceeding those in the first wave without further action.

What needs to happen in the next four weeks?

Government science advisers called for an immediate “circuit breaker” in September to stop the epidemic spiralling out of control. The three-tier system that was brought in instead was known, even at the most stringent tier 3 level, to be insufficient to bring the R value below 1 and push infections down. The result is a far larger epidemic that will take longer to bring back under control. In the next four weeks, it will be crucial for people to follow the new guidelines, which aim to reduce the amount of contact people have with one another. Scientists will be watching the R value, estimated each week, to look for signs that it is falling, but also infection rates and hospital admissions.

Elite sports will be allowed to continue behind closed doors as currently, including Premier League football matches. Aaron Walawalkar

How will scientists know if R is below 1?

Researchers on the modelling subgroup of Sage use several data streams to estimate the national and regional R values. The number of new infections picked up by hospital and community tests, but also surveys run by the ONS and Imperial College, should be among the first to reveal whether infections are slowing. Other data also feed in though, from phone surveys that quiz people about the number of people they are in contact with, to mobility data compiled by Google and Facebook. Death rates will be the last to show any improvement: there may well be people infected this week who go on to die from Covid after the four weeks have passed.

Pushing R below 1 means the epidemic is shrinking, but it is not the only consideration. Scientists will also be watching for the prevalence, or total number of cases, to fall. If the number of people infected drops substantially over lockdown, and if the remaining infections are in those who rarely need hospital treatment, the lockdown could be eased before R is brought below 1.

What role will Sage have in the decision to ease lockdown?

The Sage modelling subgroup reviews coronavirus data constantly and reaches a consensus each week about the R value and the growth rate of the epidemic. These are passed on to Sage for broader discussion. As with all policymaking, the decision on how and when to ease the lockdown will be for ministers rather than Sage, but the committee will submit proposals for the next steps. Primarily, the experts will want to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed and keep deaths down as winter comes. But other factors will feed into their advice, such as the state of NHS test and trace, and planning for people, including students, moving around the country in the run-up to Christmas.",11/2/20 0:00,

The beauty salon in Bootle, Merseyside, whose owners have denied the existence of coronavirus, said it would open as usual on Thursday and fight any fine through the courts. A message on the Instagram page of Skin Kerr said: “We will not be locking down again. We will remain open. We will fight this and any fines in a common law court.”

The owner of the salon previously described the pandemic as a “bullshit voodoo virus” and displayed posters saying: “You can’t catch what doesn’t exist,” as well as banning masks and “Covid talk”.

The salon did not respond to a request to comment. It posted a clip on Instagram on Sunday of the conspiracy theorist David Icke calling Covid-19 “a scam” and urging businesses to “simply refuse to lock down”.

Quick guide What are the three tiers of England's Covid lockdown system? Show Hide New national restrictions are due to come into effect in England on Thursday and remain in place at least until 2 December. Until that time, the country remains divided into different tiers of restrictions, as follows… Tier one – medium The “rule of six” applies, meaning socialising in groups larger than six people is prohibited whether indoors or outdoors.

Tradespeople can continue to go into a household for work and are not counted as being part of the six-person limit.

Businesses and venues can continue to operate but pubs and restaurants must ensure customers only consume food and drink while seated, and close between 10pm and 5am.

Takeaway food can continue to be sold after 10pm if ordered by phone or online.

Schools and universities remain open.

Places of worship remain open but people must not mingle in a group of more than six.

Weddings and funerals can go ahead with restrictions on the number of people who can attend (15 and 30 respectively).

Exercise classes and organised sport can continue to take place outdoors, and – if the rule of six is followed – indoors. Tier two – high People are prohibited from socialising with anybody outside their household or support bubble in any indoor setting.

Tradespeople can continue to go into a household for work.

The rule of six continues to apply for socialising outdoors, for instance in a garden or public space like a park or beach.

Businesses and venues can continue to operate but pubs and restaurants must ensure customers only consume food and drink while seated, and close between 10pm and 5am.

Takeaway food can continue to be sold after 10pm if ordered online or by phone.

Schools and universities remain open.

Places of worship remain open but people must not mingle in a group of more than six.

Weddings and funerals can go ahead with restrictions on the number of people who can attend (15 and 30 respectively).

Exercise classes and organised sport can continue to take place outdoors but will only be permitted indoors if it is possible for people to avoid mixing with those they do not live with (or share a support bubble with), or for youth or disability sport.

Travel is permitted to amenities that are open, for work or to access education, but people are advised to reduce the number of journeys where possible. Tier three – very high People are prohibited from socialising with anybody they do not live with, or have not formed a support bubble with, in any indoor setting, private garden or at most outdoor hospitality venues and ticketed events.

Tradespeople can continue to go into a household for work.

The rule of six continues to apply to outdoor public spaces, such as parks, beaches, public gardens or sports venues.

Pubs and bars are only permitted to remain open to operate as restaurants, in which case alcohol can only be served as part of a substantial meal.

Schools and universities remain open.

Places of worship remain open but household mixing is not permitted.

Weddings and funerals can go ahead with restrictions on the number of people attending (15 and 30 respectively) but wedding receptions are not allowed.

The rules for exercise classes and organised sport are the same as in tier 2. They can continue to take place outdoors but will only be permitted indoors if it is possible for people to avoid mixing with people they do not live with (or share a support bubble with), or for youth or disability sport. However, in Merseyside, gyms were ordered to close when it entered tier 3.

Travelling outside a very high alert level area or entering a very high alert level area should be avoided other than for things such as work, education or youth services, to meet caring responsibilities or if travelling through as part of a longer journey.

Kevin Harper, the gym’s owner, said his facility was “cleaner than an operating theatre” and that gyms were “as important as churches, hospitals, pubs and restaurants” so should be allowed to stay open.

He said he would fight any fine and “clog the legal system”. “I’ve not broken any laws. I have not injured anybody. I have not hurt anybody. That will be my legal argument. And on Thursday morning when I open up at 9.30 the police will be here, I guarantee, and I welcome them. These are not criminal matters. It’s preposterous.”

Harper, who has run the gym for 12 years, falsely claimed that there was “no categorical scientific proof that coronavirus even exists” but that he had a rigorous safety process in place, including temperature checks on arrival, strict social distancing and a “50-page risk assessment”.

He added: “When we did that first lockdown, I nearly went bankrupt. I can’t afford to do that again. I’m not being selfish, I’m being realistic. I’ll switch salaries with the prime minister, if he wants to take my £750 a month that I’m currently getting. I’m not going to be able to survive. I’ve got children. My wife’s pregnant. I’ve no choice but to stay open.”

Why is Europe yet again at the centre of the coronavirus pandemic?,"Last week Europe registered 1.5m new cases of Covid-19 – a record – making it once again the centre of the pandemic. The UK is not exempt, and England will enter a new lockdown from Thursday 5 November. From the outside, it might seem the continent is in the grip of a second wave that is ramping rapidly towards its peak. But it is not one wave, it’s many local waves, and that is crucial in understanding how to rein it in and prevent the same thing happening again.

Though there is some tentative evidence that the virus itself has undergone a change since the summer, there is none to suggest that this change has affected either the transmissibility or the severity of the disease. Nor can the change explain the synchronous surges in all parts of the continent.

Experts believe that synchronicity is explained mainly by similarities in public health strategies, driven by a shared news space – the fact, for instance, that countries lifted their first lockdowns at roughly the same time, and that schools have been open across Europe since the beginning of this academic year – and also, perhaps, by a spell of cold weather at the end of September.

The American public health expert Anthony Fauci said recently that the United States was still grappling with the first wave of the pandemic, and the same could be said of Europe. European nations just dented it more profoundly in the spring.

The view of health experts now is that, for various reasons, Europe’s strategy for exiting its spring lockdowns failed. Either politicians ignored their advice, or the systems weren’t in place to implement it correctly. People’s goodwill and trust leached away as the pandemic dragged on, and when those experts started calling for stronger measures again this autumn – and the same exit strategy as before – politicians were even less willing to listen.

The fault is not only the politicians’. Some governments may have done better than others in managing their epidemics, but all of them are trying to satisfy as many of their voters as possible – and of course, to stay in power. The misunderstandings that have landed us in this new chapter of misery belong to all of us. There are really only two of them, but they have done a lot of damage: an inability to grasp the notion of exponentiality, and the dangerous idea that you can simultaneously save lives and spare the economy.

An outbreak of Covid-19, if unchecked, grows exponentially or explosively – meaning it can be growing quietly before it suddenly appears to be out of control, and that it is always better to stop it as early as possible. Analyses of past pandemics, as well as economists’ assessments of this one – including a report published last month by the International Monetary Fund – all say the same thing: the cities, regions or countries that came down hard and early on the virus not only lost the fewest lives, they were also the most resistant economically.

What does this mean going forward? Public health experts agree that the first lockdown – as blunt or blanket as it was – was essential. Europe, like the rest of the world, was short on knowledge and equipment and needed to buy itself time. In most countries, those lockdowns drove infection rates down, but not as low a level as the experts would have liked. The virus was still circulating when they were lifted – that is, there was still community transmission – making fresh outbreaks inevitable. The optimal strategy for the next phase was therefore to impose precise, local lockdowns when those outbreaks were detected.

This meant having an effective test and trace system in place, to find the outbreak, followed by a coordinated set of measures – such as restrictions on travel in and out, social distancing measures, protection of key workers – imposed locally to stamp it out. Importantly, support could be channelled to affected areas in a more targeted way, reducing the financial burden on the state.

The failure of this strategy wasn’t noticeable at first. Many of us enjoyed a relatively carefree summer. And yet infection rates were rising – not steadily, as the cliche goes, but exponentially. The return to school, university and work amplified the spread in September, and by October hospitals were sounding the alarm. Experts had been calling for stronger measures, including increased protection for the most vulnerable, for weeks by then, but they had largely been ignored. Fatigue had set in.

“If the politicians didn’t want to act then, it wasn’t because they hadn’t understood the situation, it was because they were convinced that French people weren’t ready to hear difficult messages,” says the epidemiologist and member of the French government’s scientific advisory council Arnaud Fontanet. The council had been accused of being alarmist in early September, and a petition had even circulated demanding its resignation.

In Belgium, which has one of the highest infection rates in Europe at the moment, the virologist and government adviser Marc Van Ranst pointed to Germany’s partial lockdown in a tweet on 29 October, commenting: “We could and should have done this six weeks ago.”

Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. They differ from country to country, not only because the local context differs, but also because there is disagreement about what this next phase should achieve.

Some scientists argue the new lockdowns must eliminate community transmission entirely before the exit strategy is implemented; others say that it’s sufficient to drive infection rates down by a smaller margin and the exit strategy will finish the job, allowing economies to breathe sooner.

The devil, as always, is in the detail. But the good news is that we’re better placed to implement that exit strategy now than in the spring. Testing rates vary but are pretty high across the continent. Contact tracing is better, though not as good as it could be. It’s mostly forward looking, designed to locate people who have been exposed to an infected person. We need more of the type that tracks backwards from that person to identify an outbreak’s source. Care has improved, hospitals are better equipped. Most of us have incorporated social distancing into our routines.

But – and it’s a big but – people are tired, poorer than they were a year ago and fed up. That’s why it’s so important that governments explain clearly why this exit strategy is the only feasible one – pointing to the countries large and small, rich and poor, island and not, that have pulled it off: Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, South Korea, China. It’s also why everyone needs to get to grips with exponentiality, and with the idea that sparing the economy is a false economy. We have to contain the virus. All the alternatives are worse.

T-cell Covid immunity 'present in adults six months after first infection',"Cellular (T-cell) immunity against the virus that causes Covid-19 is likely to be present within most adults six months after primary infection, with levels considerably higher in patients with symptoms, a study suggests.

The data offers another piece of the puzzle that could be key to understanding whether previous Sars-CoV-2 infections – the virus behind Covid-19 – can prevent reinfection, and if so, for how long.

The study, led by the UK coronavirus immunology consortium, evaluated 100 non-hospitalised healthcare workers in March and April after antibody responses were detected in them. It is yet to be peer-reviewed.

It is the first study to offer data on T-cell levels six months after infection in people with mild or asymptomatic disease that is likely to represent the majority of infections, the authors say.

The results of the study are likely to be viewed positively, after previous studies suggested antibody levels can decline within the first few months post-infection.

Data released from a 100,000-person sample in August indicated about 6% of the population of England had antibodies – proteins produced in response to an infection – but antibody levels dropped by more than a quarter in three months, researchers revealed in late October.

Once the virus enters the body, it is greeted by a cavalry of cells that mount a counterattack that is swift, broad and generic. This so-called innate immune system is meant to arrest the infection in its tracks. If that mission is foiled, it buys time until the “experts” show up.

These experts constitute two types of white blood cells: B-cells and T-cells, that work like brothers-in-arms. If the virus makes it past the initial assault, some T-cells are slayers, annihilating respiratory cells the pathogen has colonised.

Meanwhile, helper T-cells take on a supportive role – including stimulating B-cells to produce molecules called antibodies that render the virus immobile or thwart it from penetrating other cells. The adaptive system also retains memory – but in the case of Covid-19, it is unclear how much and for how long.

After being tracked for six months, researchers found that every person had detectable T-cell levels, and levels were 50% higher in people who had experienced symptoms at the time of infection.

This could mean that either there will be more protection in people with more severe initial disease, or conversely, that people with asymptomatic disease are able to control the virus with lower levels of T-cells, they said.

A bigger set of patients would be tracked for a longer time period to a get a better sense of cellular immunity, given that T-cells could survive for long periods, said one of the study’s authors, Paul Moss, a professor at the University of Birmingham.

The authors also saw that T-cells levels were strongly correlated with the peak level of the antibody response. Cellular immune responses could even help to protect against the decline in antibody levels over time, they added.

Overall, the results offer evidence that T-cell immunity may last longer than antibodies – but whether these persistent T-cells offer protection against reinfection remains unclear.

“I think this data is reassuring, potentially even encouraging — but it does not mean that people cannot get reinfected,” Moss said. “We now need large-scale population studies to show how the antibody and cellular profiles act together to protect people over time.”

In the study, some people lost detectable levels of antibodies. But that did not mean that B-cells, which make antibodies, were not around to spring into action if challenged again, the authors explained.

Ideally, testing for B-cells and T-cells in the community would provide a conclusive idea of how much the antibody response was actually predicting large-scale immunity, and whether there were people who did not have antibodies but were protected by cellular immunity, cautioned the author Shamez Ladhani, a consultant epidemiologist for Public Health England.

“But at the moment, there is little evidence to suggest that there is widespread cell-mediated immunity without an antibody response.”

Paul Morgan, a professor at Cardiff University, who was not involved in the study, said: “The work provides a welcome dose of optimism that Sars-CoV2 infection (and immunisation?) can induce a robust and sustained protective immune response, although this does not yet prove immunity to further infections which will require longer-term surveillance and larger cohorts.”",11/2/20 0:00,
Fault in NHS Covid app meant thousands at risk did not quarantine,"A code error in the NHS Covid-19 app meant users had to be next to a highly infectious patient for five times as long as the NHS had decided was risky before being instructed to self-isolate, the Guardian has learned.

Quick guide What you can and can't do in England's new national Covid lockdown Show Hide New national restrictions are due to come into effect in England on Thursday, after MPs vote on them, and remain in place at least until 2 December. What can I leave home for? For childcare or education, where it is not provided online.

To go to work unless it can be done from home.

Outdoor exercise either with household members or with one person from another household.

For all medical reasons and appointments.

To escape injury or harm, such as domestic abuse.

To provide care for vulnerable people or volunteer.

To shop for food and essentials.

To see people in your support bubble.

Children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. Government say the list is not exhaustive, and other permitted reasons for leaving home may be set out later. People could face fines from police for leaving their home without a legally permitted excuse. Can different households mix indoors? No, not unless they are part of an “exclusive” support bubble, which allows a single-person household to meet and socialise with another household. Parents are allowed to form a childcare bubble with another household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is 13 or under. Can different households mix outdoors? People are allowed to meet one person from another household socially and for exercise in outdoor public spaces, which does not include private gardens. Can I attend funerals, weddings or religious services? Up to 30 people will still be allowed to attend funerals, while stone settings and ash scatterings can continue with up to 15 guests. Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies are not permitted except in “exceptional circumstances”. Places of worship must remain closed except for voluntary services, individual prayer and other exempt activities. Can I travel in the UK or abroad for a holiday? Most outbound international travel will be banned. There is no exemption for staying away from home for a holiday. This means people cannot travel internationally or within the UK, unless for work, education or other legally permitted exemptions. Which businesses will close? Everything except essential shops and education settings, which include nurseries, schools and universities, will close. Entertainment venues will also have to close. Pubs, restaurants and indoor and outdoor leisure facilities will have to close their doors once more. However, takeaway and delivery services will still be allowed, while construction and manufacturing will stay open. Parents will still be able to access registered childcare and other childcare activities where reasonably necessary to enable parents to work. Some youth services may be able to continue, such as one-to-one youth work, but most youth clubs will need to close their doors. Public services, such as jobcentres, courts, and civil registration offices will remain open. There is no exemption for grassroots organised team sports. Elite sports will be allowed to continue behind closed doors as currently, including Premier League football matches. Aaron Walawalkar

The oversight in the app meant thousands of people were told they did not need to quarantine when they were in fact at risk of spreading coronavirus.

The problem was only discovered last week, when software engineers rewrote how the app decides who needs to isolate and discovered it had been relying on faulty maths since its launch in September. According to the Sunday Times, which reported on the flaw, a source said the fault meant that a “shockingly low” number of warnings were issued.

Despite claiming more than 19m downloads of the app, which is for use in England and Wales, the UK government has continually declined to reveal how many users have been advised to isolate. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, where similar apps have fewer users, more than 25,000 people have been warned of their possible exposure to the virus.

A Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said the England and Wales version was “the only app in the world using the latest Google-Apple technology to better gauge distance to identify those most at risk, and is deemed ‘excellent’ by international standards.

“We anticipate more app users who are at high risk of having caught the virus will receive a notification to self-isolate, and that will be to everyone’s long term benefit by reducing the chances of those with the virus passing it on to others. We are very clear, everyone who is contacted will have been in close contact with someone who has a confirmed case of COVID-19.”

The root of the error, the Guardian has learned, was a decision to incorporate a measure of “infectiousness” into the app’s code. While the app was undergoing testing in the Isle of Wight, it used a simple metric that recommended isolation for anyone who had been in contact – closer than 2 metres – with a potentially infectious person for 15 minutes or more in a single day.

But shortly before the app was launched nationally, it was updated to account for the fact that people are most infectious shortly after their symptoms show. The maths was changed so that people outside that period of peak infectiousness counted for just two-fifths of the risk.

Since that meant the overall score was likely to be lower, the intention was to reduce the risk threshold correspondingly to ensure that someone of maximum infectiousness would need just three minutes of contact before they triggered an alert.

But that change never happened, and as a result, users were only told to isolate if they had spent 15 minutes close to a very infectious person, or nearly 40 minutes near someone who was pre-symptomatic but still thought to be shedding the virus.

The error was only discovered when a new version of the contact-tracing app, which can better account for exposures at mid-range (over a metre away) was created.

The unfeasibly high risk score also explained another problem plaguing the app: “ghost notifications” warning users that they may have been exposed to someone with Covid, but which never resulted in advice to isolate.

The app’s initial advice to users was that these notifications could be safely ignored, since they reflected a contact below the risk threshold; now that the NHS risk threshold is known to have been artificially low, one insider said, it is likely that the vast majority of those ghost notifications should in fact have been advice to self-isolate.

The new version of the app does away with them altogether: users will now only receive a notification if they are supposed to self-isolate.

“By removing these notifications, users can have the confidence that if they have a contact notification, they know it is from the app itself and based on the most accurate information available,” say Randeep Sidhu head of product for the test and trace app, and Gaby Appleton, the director.",11/2/20 0:00,
Keir Starmer says lockdown delay in England will cost lives,"Keir Starmer has said the government’s delay in calling a second coronavirus lockdown in England will cost lives and singled out Rishi Sunak for blame, saying the UK chancellor’s “name is all over” the decision to reject earlier tough measures.

In a speech to the annual conference of the CBI, the Labour leader said that while it would be wrong to blame the government for Covid, “I do blame it for the way it’s been handled – and I can’t forgive the catalogue of mistakes that have cost lives and livelihoods.”

In the middle of last month, Starmer called for a two-week “circuit breaker” for England to curb the spread of the virus, and coinciding with the half-term holiday for schools.

It followed the publication of documents that showed that the government’s scientific advisers had called for such a lockdown in September. Ministers rejected this, but changed course on Friday after forecasts indicated that without further action the number of Covid deaths over the winter could significantly exceed those in the first peak.

Addressing the CBI – Boris Johnson had also been due to address the business organisation on Monday, but pulled out to focus on a Commons statement about the new plan – Starmer said that when the scientists recommended the circuit breaker, on 21 September, there were slightly more than 4,000 daily infections and 11 deaths.

“Forty days later, when [the PM] finally decided to announce a longer, four-week national lockdown, those figures had increased to 326 deaths a day, and 22,000 Covid cases. That is the human cost of the government’s inaction,” Starmer said.

In a direct attack on Sunak, he added: “The impact on business, and jobs, will be severe. Make no mistake, the chancellor’s name is all over this. His decision to block a circuit breaker, to dismiss it as a ‘blunt instrument’ and to pretend that you can protect the economy without controlling the virus will now mean that businesses have to close for longer, more people will lose their jobs, and the public finances will be worse than they needed to be.

“It makes me so angry and so frustrated that when the British people – and British businesses – have given so much and made so many sacrifices, they have been let down so badly by the government.”

Starmer said Sunak needed to also address parliament on Monday, to fully explain the package of support for businesses and employees during the new lockdown, which begins on Thursday and is due to last for four weeks.

He said: “One of the things I’ve learned from this crisis is that it exposes leadership like nothing else. On that count the prime minister and the chancellor have failed. They failed to learn. They failed to listen. And they failed to lead. The result is tragic – but all too predictable.”

The Labour leader also castigated Johnson for potentially failing to reach a full Brexit trade deal with the EU, bringing the possibility that the chaos of a winter Covid peak could be exacerbated by full departure on 31 December without a final deal.

“The prime minister said he would get one,” Starmer said. “In fact, he said he had one. So he should get on with it. Stop fuelling uncertainty at the worst possible time and secure the deal he promised.”",11/2/20 0:00,
Police may be asked to stop England residents escaping to Wales to avoid lockdown,"Police may have to take action to stop residents of England “escaping” to Wales for an evening in a pub or restaurant when the month-long English lockdown comes into force from Thursday, the Welsh government has said.

The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said police forces on both sides of the border would have a role to play to make sure English residents do not illegally cross the border when the Welsh hospitality industry reopens next week after Wales’ 17-day “firebreak” lockdown ends.

Drakeford said that while Welsh residents will be able to travel around the country once the firebreak finishes, they will not be able to cross the border to England or travel abroad without good reason. English residents will not be able to travel to Wales apart from for essential purposes.

Asked if this was the “hardest” the border had ever been, the first minister said: “That may well be the case, for several centuries at least.”



Drakeford’s government was taken by surprise by the UK government’s decision to impose an English lockdown, learning of the plans not from Westminster but from leaks to British newspapers.

The first minister said: “We have to consider the impact the English lockdown will have on the next steps we take in Wales. We need to do this because we share a long and porous border. Every day on a non-lockdown day almost 150,000 people crisscross this border to work, visit family, shop and to travel.

“It is really important as we open up Wales doesn’t become an escape for people seeking to circumvent the tighter restrictions imposed by the prime minister.”

The first minister announced a range of national measures that will come into force when the firebreak ends on Monday.

These include two households being allowed to form a “bubble”, up to 15 people being permitted to take part in an organised activity indoor and up to 30 an outdoor one.

Premises such as restaurants, cafes, pubs and gyms will reopen – but the full details were still being worked on in the light of the UK government’s announcement.

The Welsh government said people in Wales should avoid non-essential travel as much as possible though there will be no legal restrictions on travel within the country for residents. This means that Welsh residents will be allowed to go on holiday within Wales.

As expected, all schools will reopen and churches and other places of worship will resume services.

Drakeford said on Monday there was “good evidence” that most people in Wales were so far obeying the country’s “firebreak” rules.

He said local lockdowns that preceded the firebreak had slowed the epidemic down but it is too early to judge the impact of the 17-day mini lockdown.

Drakeford said the measures that were being taken were designed to avoid another lockdown in Wales this year, adding: “By doing everything we’re doing and provided we behave in the right way we are confident we can get through to Christmas without needing to go through this again.”

The first minister also said that his government was establishing a new central “test, trace, protect” team that could be deployed to areas where there were particularly acute outbreaks.

He admitted the speed with which Covid-19 had returned had been faster than expected. More than 1,000 people are in hospitals in Wales with the virus but Drakeford insisted that the NHS was coping and was still able to treat people for other conditions.

Calling on people not to try to get around the rules, Drakeford said: “Rather than us asking what we can or can’t do, we need to ask ourselves what should we be doing to keep our families safe.”",11/2/20 0:00,
Wetherspoon's offers 99p pints in run-up to England lockdown,"Wetherspoon’s pubs will sell pints of ale for 99p to try to clear stock that will otherwise be poured down the drain during England’s new lockdown.

Britain’s largest pub chain will close its English locations on Wednesday at 10pm before the lockdown, after the government’s surprise announcement on Saturday.

The statement by the prime minister has prompted a scramble to prepare for another round of forced business closures.

“Wetherspoon’s had already introduced significant price cuts, with pints of ale going for £1.29 as it tried to keep customers coming when the government-funded ‘eat out to help out’ scheme expired,” the company said.

Wetherspoon’s had previously never lost money since its foundation in 1984, but the pandemic caused a 30% sales slump in the year to 26 July. That pushed it to a £105m loss.

The short notice of the lockdown has meant pubs face the prospect of throwing away expensive stock again. Approximately 70m pints of beer were thrown away during the first UK-wide lockdown in March, according to data from the British Beer and Pubs Association. The industry group estimates 7.5m could go to waste this time.

Jonathan Neame, the chief executive of Shepherd Neame, one of Britain’s oldest breweries, criticised the government for repeatedly changing its approach to the hospitality industry.

Neame also criticised a ban on selling takeaway beer – which was allowed when the first lockdown eased – once the pubs close on Wednesday night. In an interview with BBC Radio 4, he said: “Now we’re told that all the beer that is in pub cellars, we can’t even sell a pint of ale as a takeaway with a meal during lockdown, so we’ve got to tip that all down the drain,” he said.

A spokesman for Wetherspoon’s, Eddie Gershon, said: “All of our pubs in England will be serving their real ales at 99p a pint until the pubs close on Wednesday night.

“The reality is that any real ales not sold between now and lockdown will have to be thrown away, so it is better that customers can enjoy it at a great price while the pubs remain open.”

Wetherspoon’s denied the promotion would have any effect on transmission of Covid-19. Gershon said each pub had brought in government-mandated safety measures and restrictions on visitor numbers.",11/2/20 0:00,
What England's second lockdown means for your finances,"With England going into another lockdown on Thursday, the Treasury and the City regulator have stepped in to offer support for people who are not able to work while businesses are closed down.

Schemes to prevent people falling behind on mortgage and loan repayments, and to help cover their wages, are being extended.

What help is there for workers struggling to pay their mortgage?

The UK government’s mortgage payments holiday scheme, which has allowed householders a six-month payments deferral, was due to end on Saturday 31 October but this has been extended to help people who will not be able to work during lockdown.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is working with lenders on the small print but the watchdog has proposed that borrowers who have not yet had a payment deferral will be able to request one.

Also, those who have deferred payments for less than six months will be able to ask for an extension. In total, borrowers will be able to stop payments for up to six months. After that they will need to come to another arrangement with their lender.

As before, interest will continue to build up during the deferral period and at some point you will face either higher monthly repayments or, if your lender allows, will need to extend your mortgage term. A deferral may not be the best option for you, so ask your lender about your options before you decide.

What about other loans?

Again, the repayment holidays that were due to stop on Saturday have been extended. The FCA says that it wants lenders to offer deferrals for up to six months “unless it is obviously not in the customer’s interests”.

For high-cost short-term borrowing – payday loans, for example – borrowers can ask for a month’s respite if they have not already had a payment break.

The FCA says consumers should not contact their lenders yet and will hear from them once the plans are confirmed.

My employer is going to shut – can I be furloughed again?

Yes. The furlough scheme was due to be replaced by the far less generous job support scheme (JSS) on 1 November. Instead, furlough will continue and will pay up to 80% of workers’ wages – up to £2,500 a month – until December.

To be eligible for the extension, employees must have been on the payroll on 30 October 2020.

I have a short break booked in the UK in November – will I get a refund?

The Competition and Markets Authority has previously stated that refunds should be paid to customers who cannot take up a service because of government regulations.

Despite this, some consumers are expected to lose out. For example, Airbnb is at odds with the CMA’s stance. It has stated that its standard cancellation terms will apply to all bookings made after March, meaning that some people will lose up to half their money. The company keeps its booking fee if the consumer cancels. Better to let the host cancel, in which case you are entitled to a full refund.

After the Canary Islands were added to the no-quarantine list last week, November bookings for the destination soared as people tried to grab some last-minute sun. If you are due to fly before Wednesday night, you can still go. Trips that were due to depart from Thursday onwards are off and whether you receive a refund will depend on how you booked the trip.

Those who booked a package tour will have that trip cancelled and will be entitled to a full refund under the package tour regulations.

If you booked your own flight and accommodation, it is looking far less certain. If your flight is cancelled by the airline you can ask for a refund but if it is going ahead you may not get your money back. On Monday, Ryanair announced that it would not be refunding customers who do not get on flights it is still running.

Few travel insurance policies are paying out for the cancellation of trips booked after mid-March, when the coronavirus pandemic became a “known event”.

The lesson of lockdown 2: never again run down England's public health defences,"A leak inquiry? The looming lockdown was no state secret, as everyone had watched the graphs of doom ticking upwards daily: Ipsos Mori repeatedly found a majority of British people urging stricter controls. What was the cabinet doing all summer?

That picture of the mask-free chancellor serving Wagamama plates for his “eat out to help out” disaster may be a career-killer, seeing as how he urged everyone into hot pubs and restaurants with the virus still in the air: his scheme alone raised infections by up to 17%. He sent up the party-time flares and plane-loads of holidaymakers flew off to enjoy the Spanish nightlife. Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow …

The Covid deniers still make idiots of themselves: as the latest issue of the Spectator hit the news-stands challenging the emergency science group Sage’s “reasonable worst-case scenario”, the daily figures overshot that hypothesis at warp speed. But that didn’t stop the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith protesting in the Sunday Telegraph that the prime minister had “given in to the advice of his scientific advisers” – those damned experts – again.

It didn’t take prophetic genius for Labour’s Keir Starmer to urge Boris Johnson to follow Sage’s mid-September advice for a two-week circuit-break while schools were closed for half-term. Nor does it take a crystal ball to predict that this fatal delay means an even longer lockdown, continuing beyond 2 December, is near-certain.

Only NHS England chief Simon Stevens’ stark Halloween warning of ice rinks being requisitioned for morgues forced Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak to act. They had learned nothing. Johnson pretended English exceptionalism would magically hold back the second wave. Now, months after everyone else, he is “humble in the face of nature”.

The failure of privatised test and tracing to find people hardly mattered when fewer than 20% of people obey orders to totally isolate once infected. As a result, that £12bn has been “totally wasted”, Prof Susan Michie of Sage’s behavioural subcommittee tells me. She Zoom-meets other countries’ experts to hear what works. Britons dismiss foreigners, but the ingredients are simple and universal: effective isolating means no need for lockdowns, she says. What works is not our government’s threat of £10,000 fines, but care and kindness.

Forget racist ideas that eastern people are obedient automata; their methods succeed. Take (far poorer) Vietnam: if isolating in an overcrowded home is impossible, people are offered hotel rooms with care. Why don’t we? Take Taiwan, Covid-free for 200 days: everyone infected is visited daily, offered food parcels, medicines, comfort and psychological support, any problems eased. All carrot, very little stick. And here’s the key: wages are paid.

Today’s ComRes snap poll shows 72% of English people support lockdown, so why is compliance so weak? Michie says it’s not rebellious ravers but mainly people who can’t afford to stop work. Our £95.85 weekly sick pay is the lowest in the OECD: Slovenia pays 90% of wages; even the US now pays 100% of wages.

Yet here, 2 million people earning less than £120 per week don’t even get sick pay, so a message from a call centre to isolate has a weak effect. A minicab driver is reluctant to name his equally impoverished friends as contacts. Those who can claim universal credit face a five-week wait, or a loan that will take a year to pay off.

Give people the help they need and they will stay at home, but that takes not a Serco phone command but local, knowledgable tracers to care for the isolated. People need warm blankets of support. Likewise in schools, yet the government wants a culture war with teachers instead of treating them with the same compassion and praise as NHS and care staff. Prioritise schools for these fast, frequent tests, nurture staff and children sent home – this time give each child a laptop – with top-quality nationally streamed classes.

We should expect more pandemics, possibly far worse, and the World Health Organization is warning of an anti-microbial resistance plague that would turn everyday infections lethal. Donald Trump shut down the US Emerging Pandemic Threats programme just before Covid-19 arrived. Its chief virus hunter now warns the FT: “There will be another event – it’s already out there.”

I doubt the British government has learned the lesson: never again run down the country’s public health defences. England’s entire public health system was demolished by the 2012 Lansley act, abolishing regional health authorities, regional public health directors and local primary care trusts. Public health directors were swallowed into impoverished local authorities without ring-fenced funds, their status downgraded, with shrunken environmental health budgets. NHS protective equipment found in disarray in a privately contracted warehouse was an emblem of a decade of neglect.

Over the past decade, England’s public health has worsened for the first time in living memory. With track and trace downgraded, sexually transmitted diseases rose. Drug deaths rose. Immunisations fell. The number of school nurses tumbled to just 2,000 for 33,000 schools. Health visitors declined in number, with GPs often overwhelmed. Life expectancy unexpectedly stalled, with poorer women dying younger. Most shocking, infant mortality rose. This pandemic has shown how rising poverty and its diseases make Britain more defenceless.

Prof Gabriel Scally, the president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine, recalls the bravery of Donald Acheson, the chief medical officer who forced Margaret Thatcher, against her strong will, to confront HIV/Aids. Why didn’t Sage stand up as forcefully for an early lockdown? Why were our chief medical and scientific officers so passive with the politicians?

Medical miracles make headlines, but public health has saved more lives. Joseph Bazalgette extracted an unprecedented gigantic budget to build sewers that stopped cholera and typhoid. Johnson’s “build back better” wants HS2, but he should start with building back public health, where a real “levelling up” would put the causes and effects of poverty first.",11/2/20 0:00,
The EU has put plant-based burgers back on the menu | Alicia Kennedy,"It’s no longer obvious that one’s burger must come from an animal – and this has people in the industrial livestock world scared.

In recent years, both the United States and European Union have seen cases brought by advocates of animal-flesh meat against plant-based meat, which can be made of anything from genetically modified soy protein to oyster mushrooms. What is important here is the resemblance to the animal product; meat industries don’t want vegetarian products to be sold as “vegan burgers” or “vegetarian sausages”.

In 2019 alone, in more than 24 states in the US attempts were made to pass legislation restricting what could be labelled with meat terms. Last month, the European Union decided that meat-related descriptors were fine – though words such as “dairy”, “butter”, “cream imitation”, and “yogurt-style” were not to be used on labels for non-dairy products. These legislative manoeuvres are the last gasps of industrial animal agriculture, fighting for relevance in a food landscape that is shifting toward plant-based diets.

That shift is thanks to the news of livestock’s impact on climate breakdown, since a 2019 UN report said that a shift toward plant-based consumption would be necessary to stem the crisis. The Covid-19 pandemic has also focused minds on the consequences of having a rapacious farm and agriculture industry, which breeds the conditions for disease. There is now a high demand for plant-based meats in Asia, the continent where 44% of the world’s meat is consumed.

Plant burgers and other products have begun to resemble their cow- and pig-based counterparts in appearance and content. We’re in a time of technological innovation in plant-based meat, as seen in Beyond Meat’s burgers and sausages, which are based on vegetable-derived proteins, as well as cultured or lab-made meat that is derived from actual animal cells.

These plant-based meats have been developed not to market to vegetarians or vegans with ethical or health concerns, but omnivores who want to cut back on meat consumption for environmental reasons. Those who traffic in beef steaks and pork sausages don’t want that to happen, and these pushes for labelling restrictions look like an attempt to slow down or distract from the need for further regulation of animal agriculture for its damaging effects on the environment. Any consumer “confusion” that lawmakers and lobbyists are citing as reason to keep these words off food labels has been manufactured.

The EU’s decision works in the plant-based meat producers’ favour and rightly so: one is hard-pressed to think that someone in the supermarket might truly mistake a Beyond Meat sausage for a pork-based one, especially when the labelling clearly states that it is “plant-based”. Words on a label are not likely to cause the meat aisle anarchy that was being predicted. As Jasmijn de Boo, the vice president of ProVeg International, an NGO that works toward food system change, told the New York Times: “Why change something to a ‘veggie disc’ or ‘tube’ instead of a sausage? It’s ridiculous.”

But while confusion is unlikely to be a consumer problem, understanding the power of imitation is key. In his book Meat Planet, Benjamin Wurgaft observes: “Cultured meat as a project responds to a specific moment in the history of meat, a moment that happens to be unique from the standpoint of human history.” Cultured and lab-made meat have been cultivated specifically to respond to the way meat is consumed in the west. Hence the focus on reproducing the types of food, like burgers and sausages, most often consumed at barbecues to celebrate the Fourth of July in the US, rather than creating “new” types of food with these new technologies.

In fact, ever since they made their debut in the early 20th century, meat-like proteins have been formed to approximate animal meat as much as possible. In his 1991 book Meat: A Natural Symbol, Nick Fiddes writes: “The range of soya-based meat-analogues and other substitutes available today testifies to the centrality of the concept of meat, not its dispensability.”

The Covid-19 pandemic shows we must transform the global food system | Jan Dutkiewicz, Astra Taylor and Troy Vettese Read more

The significance here is of meat as a symbol of strength, virility and wealth, and what happens when that symbolic significance is transferred to products for which no animal was slaughtered. It’s this meaning that is the cause of all the fuss to attempt to devalue plant-based meat facsimiles. The meat industry understands that once the public becomes culturally accustomed to eating meat without eating meat then its days are truly numbered.

While there must be more transparency around the ecological impacts of the genetically modified soy and pea protein that are the basis of some of the most famous plant-based burgers of today, the fact that they have big meat producers in fear means that things are changing. We are moving toward a future in which the support and practices of small farmers, local agriculture and ecology – rather than the interests of massive, environmentally damaging meat lobbies – are the most important factors in how we build our meals.",11/2/20 0:00,
The second lockdown is a chance to get it right – so I’m taking a new approach | Emma Beddington,"Do you recall, several lifetimes ago, Donald Tusk urging the UK: “Please do not waste this time,” after the Brexit extension in April 2019? The government did the polar opposite, lurching from the grisly Tory leadership contest to the prolonged parliamentary recess and proroguing shenanigans, then the election, all punctuated by wearisome outbreaks of Jacob Rees-Moggery and absurd policy initiatives from the Dominic Cummings blue-sky thinking whiteboard. I feel exhausted just typing that.

I was reminded of that this year as the government was again urged repeatedly – this time by doctors, epidemiologists and anyone with half a brain and the energy to continue banging their head against a brick wall – to use its time wisely and exploit the window of opportunity provided by lockdown and lower case numbers to fix test and trace. Of course, it has done nothing of the sort, so England finds itself slumping wearily into a late, grim second lockdown.

Fairness demands, however, that I also question my own preparedness. We all knew this was coming, not just the government. Have I used the time wisely, bustling around like a Beatrix Potter character to prepare a cosy, healthy and well-equipped winter? Or have I, too, wasted it, watching videos of porcupines eating biscuits?

A quick survey of the Beddington homestead reveals that none of the inmates have “used the time wisely” to tidy or recycle the teetering mountain of food containers, cardboard and abortive exam revision materials. Our provisions stockpile amounts to nothing more exciting than some Doritos and more butternut squashes than anyone cares to deal with (the curse of winter vegetable box deliveries).

Admin-wise, the picture is even worse: no one has opened any post for months (it looks so dull) and three out of four household members have forgotten their pin numbers. In a cursory nod to health and fitness, I did acquire a foam roller, but so far it functions only as a trip hazard.

In summary, I am entering this second huis clos in an on-brand state of moderate squalor, logistical chaos and apathy, but as a world authority on rodent Instagram accounts.

Despite this, I want to do better this time around: after all, when else in life do we get a chance for a do-over? With the second lockdown, we have a chance to get it right, albeit with half the daylight and none of the confidence or optimism of the first version.

Thankfully, I think most of us are bringing radically lowered expectations to the table: a good day will be one with a manageable supermarket queue and no devastating news. That goes for personal goals, too: any illusions about what we would do with more time on our hands (learn the trombone or Russian subjunctive, perhaps) have been crushed – and that is fine. If we do nothing more ambitious than smash our custard-cream-eating records, it would still be a good lockdown, because we are keeping each other safe.

There are honourable exceptions to the collective underachievement: I love the wholesome tale of Tony Mortimer, from 90s pop rascals East 17, who has catalogued his literary journey from tweeting he was “reading my first ever novel lol” in April to having read 63 and started writing his own by October.

I am no Mortimer, though. With no time to waste, I am reduced to stealing ideas to improve my second lockdown. It is too late to get into gardening – garden centres are overrun – and I have no space (or, frankly, inclination) to join the model railway craze. Instead, I am following the author Naomi Alderman’s suggestion of acquiring and opening multiple Advent calendars “full of unusual small daily treats” from now until March. My inner Calvinist thinks an Advent calendar should feature nothing more than austere bible verses; my inner sybarite is winning and eyeing up fancy chocolates and stationery.

My other favourite idea comes from my sister, who is locked down in Paris. Recently, she informs me, her neighbours have been participating in a few cheery minutes of communally shouting expletives about President Macron at 9pm every night (“Macron enculé,” apparently). Forget rainbows and clapping; who is joining me in a nightly “swear at Boris”?",11/2/20 0:00,
Egyptian NHS doctor stricken by Covid seeks visa reassurances from Home Office,"An Egyptian NHS doctor who became critically ill after complications from contracting Covid-19 has spoken for the first time about his fears of being removed from the UK by the Home Office while he lay in his hospital bed on a ventilator.

Dr Basem Enany, a locum consultant cardiologist at York teaching hospital, had treated many coronavirus patients. He was placed on a ventilator after developing Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare complication of Covid-19 and other viruses, which has left him partially paralysed. He can now breathe unaided but believes he has a long rehabilitation journey ahead of him.

“At first I had the usual symptoms of Covid – cough, fever, loss of taste and smell – but then I began to develop a weakness throughout my body. Then I was no longer able to move and couldn’t breathe properly.” he said. “I had never seen this happen in any of the Covid patients I had treated and had to research my symptoms as they were so unusual.”

He has a work visa that is due to expire next month. He and his wife, Marwa Mohamed, believe they and their four young daughters could face removal from the UK as he is unlikely to be well enough by December to renew the visa.

While Enany has regained partial use of his hands, his legs remain paralysed and he is waiting to be moved from Leeds general infirmary to a specialist neuro-rehabilitation facility. “I was not sedated on the ventilator and was lying awake in my hospital bed thinking: ‘Oh my God, my visa is about to finish,’” he said.

Enany thanked the dedicated NHS workers who have been looking after him and the more than 4,000 people who have made donations to a crowdfund that will pay for his legal and medical bills. Any remaining funds will be donated to research into Covid-19 and into Guillain-Barré syndrome.

While the Home Office has said it had no plans to deport the family, Enany does not know what kind of replacement visa he will receive, how long it will be for and whether it will allow work.

While Enany thanked the Home Office for its reassurances, he said: “We still don’t have any solid documents in our hands and my visa will expire soon.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “We’ve spoken to Dr Enany’s family to reassure them that their immigration status is not in jeopardy and they are not facing enforcement action. They are here entirely legally and have every right to remain the UK. We will continue to work with them to find a way forward. Our thoughts remain with Dr Enany and his family at this difficult time.”

On Friday there will be the second reading of a private member’s bill from THE Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine calling for indefinite leave to remain to be granted to migrant NHS workers who have cared for patients during the pandemic. In her presentation of the bill she says that these NHS workers will be vital during the second wave of the pandemic.",11/2/20 0:00,
New lockdown in England could destroy travel sector say industry figures,"British travellers who rushed to book a November holiday when the Canary Islands were added to the UK’s travel corridor list on 22 October are among the tens of thousands whose forthcoming trips are now being cancelled.

Under the new lockdown rules in England, all non-essential travel in the UK and abroad is banned from 5 November until 2 December.

The news of the government’s travel ban was met with dismay by travel industry figures. Emma Coulthurst of comparison site the TravelSupermarket said the decision left the sector’s “imminent business not just frayed or ragged, but in shreds”.

“A little more than a week ago, Grant Shapps told the British public that they could travel for leisure to the Canaries. On the back of this permission, people, many of whom haven’t gone away for months, decided to book a break in November – tens of thousands of people. The return of the Canaries was heralded as a glimmer of light for the industry and for holidaymakers. Now that has been torn to pieces,” said Coulthurst.

Tui, one of the UK’s largest travel companies, said customers whose holidays are cancelled will be entitled to a refund. Those who choose to accept a credit note will be entitled to up to 10% towards the cost of their next holiday. By contrast, Jet2 said only that it would advise customers if they were affected by the new rules and said it was “working with the government to obtain much-needed clarity” on what the rules mean for overseas holidays.

Consumer magazine Which? Travel reminded travellers who have booked a package holiday that they are entitled to a refund within 14 days, and warned them to wait to hear from their holiday provider rather than cancelling the trip themselves. It said those with flight-only purchases may not receive a refund if their flight isn’t cancelled.

EasyJet Holidays issued a statement saying that the company was contacting customers with bookings up to 2 December “to discuss options which include changing holiday dates (with no change fees), receiving a credit and receiving a full refund”. Its CEO, Garry Wilson, said, “Whilst [the] announcement is disappointing, as it came with no travel industry consultation or pre-warning, we are contacting thousands of our customers to share their options and offer reassurance.”

Ryanair customers will not be offered refunds for flights in November. Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of the budget airline, said passengers would not get their money back if a flight was operating but could change the flight to a later date without paying a fee. He said: “There won’t be refunds on flights that are operating and travelling. But we’ve waived the change fees for bookings.”

Under the new restrictions all holiday accommodation in England will close. Rob Paterson chief executive officer of Best Western, a group of 300 independently owned hotels, said the news was “a crushing blow for hoteliers who have invested heavily in making their premises Covid-safe, adhering to government guidelines”.

Paterson welcomed the return of the furlough scheme to keep staff in employment but said that would not be enough to pay rents or mortgages.

“Many [hoteliers] risk failure without decisive cashflow support. The latest lockdown also equates to a much-longer recovery, so we call on government to extend the VAT discount and business rate relief,” he said.

Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership, which represents travel agents, told the trade paper Travel Weekly that 80% of members “will run out of cash by May”.

“The ban on international and domestic travel as a result of the new lockdown measures will crucify the travel industry. Whilst we absolutely support measures to keep us all safe, the reality of the new lockdown means many of our travel agency members will not last the year without a financial support package from the government,” she said.",11/2/20 0:00,

'An operational tsunami': preparing for a winter surge of Covid-19,"During the typical evening bustle of the critical care unit at University hospital, Coventry, two construction workers are hoisting temporary polythene walls into position, dividing the ward into two. Behind them, a young nurse wearing an unconventional mask – one which cloaks her entire head – is providing life-saving care to an unconscious patient.

The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the Midlands, with Coventry imposing tier 2 restrictions last week. Plans for a possible surge in admissions to University hospital are being swiftly implemented.

“We’re in the midst of what I’d call an operational tsunami,” says Prof Kiran Patel, the chief medical officer.

Construction workers erect a partition wall in critical care while clinical staff attend to patients. All photographs by Jonny Weeks.

“Winter looks like being a slow burn rather than a rapid acceleration,” says Patel in regards to coronavirus admissions. “But, at the same time, non-Covid activity levels in the hospital have risen back to normal. We’ve got a backlog of elective care [referrals including for surgery] and the tertiary sector is asking us for mutual aid and specialised support. So we’ve got a quadruple-pronged assault on our services which we’re trying to manage.”

Patel says University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire (UHCW) trust is approaching winter with a “battle rhythm” and recognises that with each passing day the challenge is becoming more acute.

Worry

Last Friday, the hospital had a total of 30 Covid-positive patients, six of them in critical care. Seven days later, those numbers had risen to 31 and 10 respectively.

On the frontline: meet the NHS workers tackling coronavirus Read more

Back in the spring, when the first wave of the pandemic peaked, the hospital had up to 32 Covid patients in ICU at any one point. Memories of that time are still fresh and a feeling of unease lingers for Dr Tom Billyard, a consultant in critical care.



“I’m worried the health service has been a bit complacent over the summer. We’ve had time to prepare but actually I’m not sure we’ve used it very well. I don’t feel very prepared.

“We normally struggle through winter, so to add more Covid patients on top of that is a big worry.”

Billyard says the expectation that hospitals should fulfil 90% of elective surgeries is particularly troublesome because it will prevent the large-scale redeployment of surgical staff that proved so helpful last time.

“The problem isn’t UHCW,” he adds, “it’s the top-down message” from the government and local health authority.

Covidology

However, senior UHCW management says the trust is equipped for a long and taxing second wave.

“We’ve learned a whole new speciality: ‘Covidology’,” says Chris Bassford, clinical lead in critical care. “We’ve learned that Cpap [non-invasive ventilation] works well and that if someone is intubated their outlook is a lot worse, so we now persist with Cpap a lot longer.

“And we’ve learned that although we would normally run anyone with chest diseases on the drier side [keeping them slightly dehydrated, with a negative fluid balance], if they have Covid it’s better to run them a little wetter.”

New safety protocols are also noticeable upon entering the Covid wards. Previously, medical staff would don an abundance of personal protective equipment to shield themselves from the virus, whereas many now wear disposable pinnies and work with bare arms.

Activities on ward 30, where treatment is given to Covid-positive patients who don’t require critical care.

“At first we saw the pictures of people in Korea wearing full E.T. spacesuits,” says Bassford, “and when we started getting patients here it was still two pairs of gloves, a gown, a pinny, an FFP3 mask and a visor. But there were unintended consequences: people found it harder to communicate and there were times – not many – where we passed the infection between patients.

“That’s why you don’t see gowns so much now. It’s a lot easier to wash your hands and skin if you’re bare below the elbows. It’s safer so long as we’re meticulous with our hygiene.”

But the past six months have proven that there is “no magic bullet” for the virus, says Billyard. The drugs remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine proved ineffective, while dexamethasone only helps to reduce mortality in critical care from 40% to 25%.

“We’re still going to see a lot of people dying from this over winter,” Billyard says. “What gets patients better is good quality intensive care.”

Bassford agrees. “You can have as many ventilators as you like but intensive care is not about the number of devices you’ve got. It is exactly what it says: it’s caring for people intensively. Caring is not a machine. It’s the staff who are at the bedside all of the time.”

Surrogate family

Tracy Newey, a healthcare assistant, was one of those redeployed to critical care in the spring. She says of her experience: “When I first went into critical care I was petrified because I’d never been in there before. I was used to dealing with surgical patients. The difference was massive. But the team showed us how to do things and now I love it.

“We feed patients, wash them, roll them, talk to them, get them talking to their relatives with iPads, and we help with them emotionally. We’re like a surrogate family.”

Carole Williams, a senior sister who oversees training of new recruits and redeployed staff, says: “In March, everyone came from everywhere to help us. But this time around we need to be slightly more selective about who we bring in.

“We also have the issue that some of our staff are now self-isolating, so we’re struggling at the moment. But people are working full pelt and they’re absolutely brilliant.”

Jill Ilsley, who has spent 33 years working in the NHS and is now responsible for forward-planning, is confident the trust can manage the demand.

“We will cope. We will keep the beds open and we will staff them safely. It will work because it has to. We can’t say: ‘Oh, I’m sorry, we’re closed today.’”

Some medical staff, such as Wilhelmina Bulley and Sadie Orton, have just begun their medical careers in the middle of the pandemic.

Bulley, a nurse who qualified in February, says: “[In three years of training], we never had an induction for a viral pandemic. So it was quite daunting to start the job at the same time as this happened. But comparing today to then, I feel more prepared, I know what’s happening and what to expect. I’m more positive.”

One of her patients on ward 30, John Latham, looks sprightly. The 81-year-old praises those who have helped him beat the virus. “They’ve been so caring and efficient,” he says. But he adds that he has been lucky.

“This disease makes you an old man. The recovery from Covid is going to be slow but I want to get home, get moving, get doing and get my life back.”

John Latham, a patient who is recovering from Covid-19.

Mental health

The pressure of saving – and losing – lives has taken its toll on staff. Rob Green, a consultant in critical care, says he is still recovering from the mental toil of the first wave.

“I’ve been through Schwartz Rounds [mental health forums for healthcare workers] and I just couldn’t bring myself to talk about Covid,” he says. “The first wave was overwhelming and I think I’m still trying to decompress from it.

Life after Covid-19: stories of survival and loss from a Coventry hospital Read more

“We train for mass casualties, and for chemical and biological events with large numbers of patients over a short timescale, but nothing like this.”

Green caught Covid in May. It was a distressing experience, he says, “because I had spent weeks telling people on wards that they had a disease for which there is no cure, then I was in that position myself”.

There was a trivial positive to come from his own recovery, he says: he has been allowed to regrow his facial hair.

“I had a beard for years and I’d always been FFP3 mask-tested with my beard [tight-fitting masks are mandatory in critical care], so when Covid happened I said: ‘I don’t need to be clean shaven to wear a mask.’ But the trust said: ‘No, no, no’, so I shaved my beard off and grew the most magnificent moustache instead, like Joe Exotic on Tiger King. Then I got coronavirus anyway.”

Invisible threat

On ward 30, Dr Asad Ali, a consultant physician and de facto lead in respiratory medicine, is checking a patient who has participated in plasma trials.

He sympathises with the experiences of people around the country because he, too, has been personally affected by Covid. Ali flew to Pakistan to visit his ill parents early in the first wave. While he was away, his brother in the UK became seriously ill with Covid.

“I got stranded overseas and had to arrange the ambulance for my brother while sitting 5,000 miles away,” he says. “I was frantically trying to get flights back from Lahore, to no avail. I booked four or five flights and they all got cancelled. When I finally flew into Heathrow, I found a new country.”

Dr Asad Ali examines an unidentified patient who has participated in plasma trials.

Ali acknowledges the sacrifices made by the public in the first wave of the pandemic and is calling on the NHS to “empower” them using hard-hitting messaging. “We don’t need to say ‘protect the NHS’; we need to say ‘protect the public’,” he says.

“If a person doesn’t see how it will affect them directly and none of their family members have got it, how long are they going to be willing to make sacrifices?

“We need to show them. They need to know the virus doesn’t discriminate. We need patients who’ve come out of intensive care and clinicians from hospitals to be part of the messaging. We need to say: this is how it impacted us, it can impact you or your loved ones too.”",10/30/20 0:00,
'This is revolutionary’: new online bookshop unites indies to rival Amazon,"Bookshop.org, which launched in the US earlier this year, has accelerated UK plans and goes online this week in partnership with more than 130 shops

It is being described as a “revolutionary moment in the history of bookselling”: a socially conscious alternative to Amazon that allows readers to buy books online while supporting their local independent bookseller. And after a hugely successful launch in the US, it is open in the UK from today.

Bookshop was dreamed up by the writer and co-founder of Literary Hub, Andy Hunter. It allows independent bookshops to create their own virtual shopfront on the site, with the stores receiving the full profit margin – 30% of the cover price – from each sale. All customer service and shipping are handled by Bookshop and its distributor partners, with titles offered at a small discount and delivered within two to three days.

“It’s been a wild ride,” said Hunter, who launched the site in the US in January. “Five weeks into what we thought was going to be a six-month period of refining and improving and making small changes, Covid-19 hit and then suddenly we were doing massive business.”

Initially starting with 250 bookshops, more than 900 stores have now signed up in the US. “We went from selling $50,000 (£38,000) worth of books in all of February, to selling $50,000 a day in March, then $150,000 a day in April,” said Hunter. By June, Bookshop sold $1m worth of books in a day. The platform has now raised more than $7.5m (£5.7m) for independent bookshops across the US.

“We were four employees plus me, working at home, getting up as early as we could and going to bed as late as we could, trying to make it all work. It was a real white-knuckle ride,” said Hunter. “But it was extremely gratifying because the whole time we were getting messages from stores saying, ‘Thank God you came along, you’ve paid our rent, you’ve paid our health insurance this year.’ If you’re going to have to work in insane circumstances and with huge amounts of stress, it’s good to be doing it in something you feel good about.”

Bookshop is a B Corporation, created with the mission “to benefit the public good by contributing to the welfare of the independent literary community”. Rules state that it can never be sold to a major US retailer, including Amazon.

Hunter believes the reason for Bookshop’s quick success is readers’ fondness for their local booksellers. “Bookstores have been in trouble for a while because of Amazon’s growth, but this pandemic has really accelerated it. Amazon has gotten much more powerful, while there are 100-year-old stores that are hanging on for survival,” he said. “I think we were so successful because enough people were conscious of that, and wanted to rally around around their beloved bookstores, because they care about the world that we emerge from this pandemic into.”

Hunter had been planning to launch Bookshop in the UK in 2021 or 2022. But after seeing the success of the platform in the US, shops, publishers and authors in the UK asked him to step up the timeline. Bookshop.org launches in the UK on Monday, with more than 130 British bookshops already signed up and 200 expected by the end of the year. The UK arm of the company will be run by managing director Nicole Vanderbilt, the former international vice-president of Etsy.

“If you don’t get there before Christmas, and give people a way to support their stores and buy their gift books, then it’s gonna be really catastrophic for shops, which is why we’ve scrambled all hands on deck to get it up,” said Hunter.

Bookshops make no financial investment, with all customer service and shipping handled by Bookshop, and, in the UK, by distributor Gardners. The browsing experience is intended to “mirror the joy of discovering a new book in a physical bookshop”, says the company, with experts, rather than algorithms, doing the curating. Each independent that joins has its own “storefront” page, where customers can browse virtual tables of recommended books. For example, a user can see what the owner of The Shetland Times Bookshop (“Britain’s most northerly general bookshop, situated over 60 degrees north and closer to Norway than to London”) personally recommends, in lists such as “wonderfully funny picture books I’ve read to the bookshop staff”, and “books to help you take life in your stride”.

British booksellers and publishers have welcomed its arrival. “Being an independent bookseller has for so many years been such a David v Goliath battle that it feels slightly disconcerting when someone at last hands you a bazooka instead of you peppering away with your slingshot,” said Andy Rossiter of Rossiter Books in Ross-on-Wye.

Philip Gwyn Jones, publisher at Picador, described Bookshop as “a positively revolutionary moment in the history of bookselling in the UK, and in the evolution of the relationship between writers and readers”.

“It’s hard for us to compete with someone that’s got its own warehouse and sells books sometimes at a loss, or at very small profit margins. We just can’t do that. So it’s nice that Bookshop.org is going to rival Amazon in a way we couldn’t on our own or even collectively,” said Georgia Eckert, of Imagined Things bookshop in Harrogate. “You’ve got to have the reach, a site that’s big enough, run by a proper team of people dedicated to it. We’re all running our own businesses and haven’t got time to be doing that.”",11/2/20 0:00,
"The evidence is clear: if countries act together, they can suppress Covid","Just 10 days after calling a national lockdown “the height of absurdity”, the prime minister announced on Saturday evening a four-week national lockdown in England starting on Thursday 5 November and lasting until 2 December. In a reminder of March, people are being asked to “stay at home” unless for essential purposes, and to avoid meeting others indoors or in private gardens. Pubs, restaurants, fitness studios and gyms will also have to close while, in an important distinction from the first lockdown, schools, colleges and universities will remain open for in-person learning.

Even with these new measures in place, thousands of people will still die of Covid-19 in the weeks to come, given the lag in lockdown measures on transmission. The recent Imperial College React-1 study estimated that almost 100,000 people in England are being infected with the virus every day. The associated steep rise in hospital cases and deaths indicates that, without harsh measures, a second wave could be even more deadly than the first, and last longer.

Perhaps those who hypothesised that the second wave of the 1918 flu pandemic was driven by boredom and fatigue were indeed correct. The country has endured some form of lockdown since late March. Unemployment is increasing and the economy is being slowly strangled. There’s been little to no payoff for the sacrifices made in the spring, just more grim news and hopelessness. England now finds itself in a groundhog situation, governed by politicians who would rather follow public opinion than lead.

England’s trajectory follows Europe’s, and those of the other three nations of the UK. France, Germany and Ireland have all implemented strict restrictions to curtail the exponential growth of coronavirus cases. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all went into early circuit-breakers trying to avoid the previous mistakes of delaying action. However, these three nations are dependent on the UK government for financial packages to support any economic restrictions introduced, limiting their ability to continue these beyond the end of the furlough scheme, now extended by a month.

All governments face a Covid-19 paradox that is common in public health: prevent illness from occurring and get blamed for enacting measures that saved lives, or wait to enact these measures and then be blamed for avoidable deaths. The UK government’s decision to delay a national lockdown in the hope that this would be easier on the economy defies reality: delaying action has led only to a longer, harsher lockdown. It can feel as though, confronted with this paradox and exhausted by the months of work that lie ahead, the government is close to giving up without a clear plan or strategy for how to survive in a Covid-19 world.

Meanwhile radio show hosts have been arguing for T-cell immunity (which is a matter for science and data, and not for debate and spin) and pointing to the supposed success of Sweden. Sweden, however, is witnessing big rises in the number of cases, and has been asking its inhabitants to avoid public transport, not visit other households, and follow guidance on distancing and hand-washing.

It’s time to stop fighting each other over how serious Covid-19 is, or whether PCR tests work, and agree on collective goals that everyone wants: to protect health services for all patients, a strong economic recovery, to ensure schools stay open, and to minimise illness and mortality. Rather than focusing on the endless repetition of dead cats, such as whether Christmas is cancelled, we should fix our attention on solutions. The real question isn’t what we want, but how we get there.

There are few options for all countries. An attempt to “simmer” the virus through society at an acceptable level will simply lead to repeated lockdown-and-release cycles. This is because of the infectiousness of this virus and the associated high hospitalisation rate of Covid-19 patients, which puts strain on health services, health staff and resources, and forces governments into crude and reactive harsh measures to curtail further spread and stay within health service capacity. We are already seeing the start of these cycles.

What about just lifting all restrictions and letting the virus go uncontrolled quickly through the population? Some might see this as an acceptable cost-benefit calculation: “life back to normal” for millions – especially younger and healthier people – at the cost of the deaths of thousands. Not only is this approach unethical and immoral, it would take us down a dangerous path. If the virus were allowed to spread freely, health services would be likely to collapse under pressure, leading to widespread panic and uncertainty. Far from saving the economy by lifting the existing restrictions, this would end up damaging the economy more; people would probably come to fear the consequences of participating in social and economic activities as they witnessed the effects of coronavirus and failing health services on members of their family, friends and neighbours.

Indeed, a CBI panel I was on recently, with chief executives of some major companies such as Unilever and Alpro, noted that fear of the virus has changed consumer behaviour: economic damage to their businesses is high because, for as long the virus is circulating, consumer behaviour has changed.

The best option, for the health of people and that of the economy, is to pursue a “maximum suppression” approach, which means pushing numbers low enough to avoid a repeated cycle of lockdowns. Crucially, this doesn’t mean an actual lockdown, but a strategy similar to that seen in east Asian and Pacific countries: stronger border measures to prevent reimportation of the virus, good guidance to the public about how to avoid crowded settings and, most importantly, a robust system of testing, tracing and isolating. This would include financial support, generously paying those who test positive with the virus to stay at home.

The UK was in a good position to pursue this in late June, given low prevalence, but failed to form a strategy to maintain low numbers and protect against reinfections. Rather than acting alone, the UK needs to partner with its neighbours in Europe to agree a common regional approach. African countries have worked well regionally, as have those in east Asia and the Pacific. A cooperative strategy seems like a distant possibility now, but with a truly hard winter ahead for Europe, it may become more feasible in the spring. Countries may realise that the only way forward is together, and an elimination strategy (to stop community transmission within national borders) is the least-worst path through this crisis for their economies and societies.

Small shifts by each of us can make a huge collective impact. We haven’t been distancing or wearing masks because the government tells us to, but because we care for our families, friends and communities. Caring means we focus on all the things we can do safely instead of fixating on those we can’t.

As countries have painfully learned, it is easy to underestimate Covid-19. This is a dangerous virus precisely because one person’s death sentence can cause absolutely no symptoms in someone else. The entire world has changed because of it. We can either mourn the past or look forward to creating new systems, business models, relationships and routines.

How can we build a safer, healthier world for all? How can we make changes in our lives to support this? And what kind of leadership do we need in the next pandemic? Integrity, competence, kindness, compassion, empathy, vision and hard work: these seem to be the core traits of the leaders who have won the trust of their populations and led their countries effectively through this crisis.

Western societies have failed the deadly Covid test. They must learn lessons from Asia | Will Hutton,"Is Covid-19 the virus that killed not just millions of people but also the supremacy of western economies, liberal values and convictions that democracy is the best form of government? As France and Belgium lead Europe back into national lockdowns and Britain is set to follow, no European country, whatever their record until now, is free from a surge in infections. The coronavirus experience in the United States will almost certainly cost Donald Trump the presidency. However, autocracies and communitarian societies in Asia are faring much better; China and a host of Asian countries are managing to contain the virus and grow their economies. Taiwan has not seen a locally transmitted case for more than six months.

None of this was lost on the top members of the Chinese Communist party who met last week to decide on their plans, not only for the next five years but the next 15. They agreed that China’s party-led collective development is at the heart of all its achievements and that this will now be even more vigorously promoted in its diplomacy, a coded reference to the belt-and-road initiative. This astonishing Chinese version of the postwar Marshall Plan, only many times larger, invites signatories in some 100 countries, in exchange for billions in aid to build up infrastructure, to accept and emulate China’s collective approach to economic and social development. There is to be no let-up.

Even human rights should be seen as the right, collectively, to share in economic and social advance, emphatically not as individual freedoms to vote and to act and think independently of state direction. It is because China adheres to these principles that it has managed to contain Covid-19 more effectively than the west, using its Orwellian national surveillance system to insist on social distancing, quarantining and curfews. Equally, its Leninist capitalism has provided 60m new jobs over the past five years, continuing into 2020 despite Covid. In the future, declared the party communique, innovation is to occupy the “core position” in China’s drive for “quality” growth and the aim, by 2025, is to have achieved “self-reliance in science and technology”. The already stunning sums spent on future technologies are to be raised again.

Democratic government in the west is failing, weak and should have prepared for a second wave

Meanwhile, western societies and economies reel as the extreme right provokes violent street protests against tightening restrictions. There are armed militias in the US, mafia-inspired protests in Italy and hard-right rioting in Spain. Democratic government is failing, weak and should have prepared for a second wave: better to have a libertarian free-for-all, with everyone taking their chance, than more ineffective restrictions goes the rightwing rallying cry.

Global stock markets have had their worst week since March as it becomes obvious that, whatever the economic resilience in Asia, it is not shared in the US and Europe, which are descending into prolonged recession. Is our choice to follow China or descend into a dystopian world fit for Mad Max?

There is another option – a 21st-century recreation of the spirit of the New Deal, the Attlee government and Jean Monnet and the founders of the EU. At times like these, progressive leaders have the chance in democracies to wrest the dominant argument from the right, win elections and use the mandate to launch powerful economic and social programmes that work. The postwar settlement that our predecessors devised - national and international and with fairness at its heart - created 30 years of prosperity and embedded the legitimacy of democracy; its subsequent unwinding by the Anglo-Saxon right and indifference to the growth of inequality have led to today’s debacle. The Donald Trumps and Boris Johnsons, along with the philosophy they represent, need to be dispatched.

All the signs are that on Tuesday the US electorate is poised to do just that. My expectation is that Joe Biden is going to win an extraordinary mandate for his brand of competent, progressive centrism to build a fairer, more equal America. Incompetence, wild policy oscillations, genuflections to libertarianism, extravagant over-claiming and, above all, the indulgence of inequality are out. The challenge will be to make his administration work; simultaneously, Biden must beat the virus, lay the foundations of a more inclusive capitalism, launch his “green New Deal”, reinvigorate international institutions and visibly promote equality. There will be a vaccine in the next 12 months that will help him, but containing the virus means, above all, having a system of income support that allows the disadvantaged, when stricken, to take themselves out of economic and social circulation.

The big lesson from Asia is that communitarian, more equal societies have the social capital and mutual support to allow curfews, self-isolation, quarantining and social distancing to work, even for the poorest. It can also be done in the west but with different tools, of which generous sick pay, income support and furlough arrangements are central. The better-off must be seen to be taking their share of the pain. It is why, in the end, everyone has to knuckle down in the event of another national lockdown.

There will be a parallel move in Britain. Biden’s victory will underline that the Johnson government is an idiosyncratic outlier. Its reflexes – a hard Brexit, tiering the intensity of Covid responses, stinginess on social support, distrust of the state, an inability to make any future vision of the economy and society seem real and, above all, an unwillingness to talk fairness and equality – are out of time. If we are to get through another gruelling national lockdown, Britain needs to start being a fairer place. There needs to be a feasible plan to build institutions and companies that will create the inclusive stakeholder economy. And we have to work with Europe.

China’s oppression and corruption – the dark sides of its success – will ultimately overwhelm it. We can win through and stand by our values but only with a very different kind of government.

The greatest tragedy of England's second wave is that it wasn't inevitable | Charlotte Summers,"The number of Covid infections is doubling every nine days in England, and in some areas, such as the south-east, London and the south-west, the R number is now above two. These are the alarming findings from the report of the React-1 study by researchers at Imperial College London, released today.

The study, which obtained nose and throat swabs from a random sample of the population in England that were analysed using a “gold standard” PCR test, shows the prevalence of coronavirus infection in England has increased across all age groups. The greatest increase has been among people aged 55-64 years, while the highest overall prevalence (the number of infected people at the time the study was carried out) was among 18 to 24-year-olds.

Hospitals are now experiencing the consequences of these increased numbers of infections. On 1 September, 59 patients with confirmed Covid were being ventilated in English intensive care units. By 28 October, this number had risen to 788. The number of hospital inpatients with confirmed Covid-19 in England has also climbed dramatically from 472 on 1 September to 8,535 on 28 October. Deaths have also increased: 761 people had Covid-19 listed as a cause of death in the week ending 16 October, the largest weekly number since the middle of June.

The situation we are in was not inevitable. Scientists warned that, without taking urgent action over the summer to mitigate the risks, this is what would happen. But the government did not heed their warnings.

In a report published in July, the Academy of Medical Sciences outlined a “reasonable worst-case scenario” in which the R value rose to 1.7 from September 2020 onwards. They predicted a peak of hospital admissions and deaths in January and February 2021 that would closely resemble the first wave we saw in spring, coinciding with the usual winter pressures that the NHS faces.

We are now living through this scenario in October. As the report highlighted in the summer, this peak was not inevitable, and had more measures been implemented over the summer, it may not have come to this point.

Towards the end of September, months after the Academy of Medical Sciences report, the Scientific Advisory Committee for Emergencies (Sage) advised the government that a package of interventions was needed to reverse the exponential rise in coronavirus cases. These included a circuit-breaker lockdown, with people working from home where possible and no mixing between households. The measures also included closing bars, restaurants, cafes, indoor gyms, hairdressers and other indoor spaces where people mix. And Sage also recommended transferring all university and college teaching online where possible.

At this point, the government was clearly determined it wouldn’t implement these recommendations. Instead, it adopted a confusing three-tier system in England of localised lockdowns. Given the latest data from the React-1 study, it’s clear this approach hasn’t worked.

Much has been written about the economic devastation caused by lockdown restrictions. But it’s important to remember that health and wealth are closely intertwined. There are significant health consequences associated with unemployment and poverty. Dead people are not economically productive, and severely unwell ones consume resources without being able to participate in economic activities. Economics and health don’t operate in isolation.

A substantial surge in the number of Covid-19 cases also puts people with other health issues at increased risk of harm. The knock-on effects from the surge in cases during the first wave meant that some parts of the NHS had to suspend normal services. Researchers from UCL’s Institute of Health Informatics estimate there may be as many as 18,000 additional cancer deaths as a result of the strain the pandemic has placed on cancer care.

The NHS is working hard to catch up with services that were paused to allow hospitals to cope with the first surge in Covid admissions, but there are still many people in need of surgery, investigations, and out-patient appointments for illnesses that aren’t Covid related. If the healthcare system comes under sustained pressure again in the coming weeks, as seems likely, there will be an unavoidable impact on patients with other conditions.

In the spring we saw the consequences of delaying an inevitable nationwide lockdown. Every day we delay, more people are becoming infected, the scale of the problem is growing, and harsher measures will be needed for a more sustained period of time. We need urgent action to halt the spread of this virus, save lives, and protect the health of both people and the economy.

Understanding 'aerosol transmission' could be key to controlling coronavirus,"Imagine you think there are mice in your house. You can see the evidence – mouse droppings; gnawed or damaged skirting boards; holes left in food packaging. You call a local pest control team who confirm that you have mice and advise you on what is needed to remove them. Neither of you have actually had to see a mouse to reach this conclusion.

The same kind of thinking can be applied to the transmission of coronavirus. We don’t need to see the virus to understand how it spreads. Recent studies from China show that patients infected with Covid-19 in clinical settings exhale large amounts of virus, which remain present in the air and can be sampled and detected.

Because of this, scientists can reasonably infer that the virus contaminates its surrounding environment. People nearby may inhale it, and as the virus floats through the air, spreading further in poorly ventilated environments, those who are further away could also become infected. Importantly, scientists haven’t yet demonstrated that someone walking through a cloud of exhaled virus would develop Covid-19 from that particular exposure, and research in this area is ongoing. But there is growing evidence that the virus which causes Covid can remain in the air, and therefore pose a risk to people in that airspace.

The evidence that Covid can spread via aerosol transmission takes one of two different forms. First, many scientists now think that aerosol transmission explained some early outbreaks, such as those in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, and at a choir practice in the US, where the virus was exhaled by people and may have remained in the surrounding environment before infecting others who inhaled it.

Second, aerosol transmission partly explains why countries that were early adopters of policies which targeted this kind of transmission have been more successful at controlling the virus. For example, south-east Asian countries were far quicker to adopt face masks, which are shown to reduce the spread of aerosols, than many western countries including the UK.

I’m not saying that aerosols are the only transmission route. Research suggests there are in fact two main ways the virus can transmit. The first is via contaminated surfaces, also known as “fomites”. The UK government emphasised this transmission route at the beginning of the pandemic, issuing public health messages that focused on hand-washing. Yet as the World Health Organization conceded in a recent Covid-19 brief, “despite consistent evidence as to … the survival of the virus on certain surfaces, there are no specific reports which have directly demonstrated fomite transmission”.

This doesn’t mean that surfaces don’t play a role in the spread of Covid-19. The WHO still considers them a “likely mode of transmission”, given consistent findings about how the virus contaminates its environment, and the fact that other coronaviruses can transmit this way. But contact with contaminated surfaces may not play as big a role as we initially thought. Indeed, a review of studies by theScientific Advisory Group for Emergencies suggested hand-hygiene policies only led to a 16% reduction in acute respiratory infections.

The other way that coronavirus spreads is likely through a combination of droplets and aerosols. Droplets are larger than aerosols; too big to remain suspended in the air, they fall more quickly on to surfaces. Aerosols are tiny by comparison and can be spread at far greater distance. Both droplets and aerosols are produced while talking, coughing, sneezing and singing, but where aerosols can remain in the air for minutes or even hours, droplets fall and contaminate surfaces from where they can contribute to transmission.

In an open letter that I co-authored with many other scientists, we outlined these ideas and cited evidence from various studies suggesting that aerosol transmission is a potentially significant route by which Covid-19 is spread. Surfaces are still important, and people should continue washing their hands, but a growing scientific consensus suggests this may not be the main way that Covid is transmitted.

Why does this matter? First, because understanding how the virus spreads is key to controlling it. On the basis of what we know about how Covid transmits, a combined approach that targets aerosols, droplets and surfaces, and gives priority to aerosols, is likely the best way to control its spread. This means a combination of policies, such as social distancing, face masks, improving indoor ventilation, reducing contact between households and enforcing the rule of six will all reduce the level of transmission.

Many countries including Britain have already adopted variations of each of these policies. So why does emphasising aerosols as one of the main routes by which the disease spreads make any difference?

The reason for recognising the virus as potentially airborne (as we do with chickenpox, measles and tuberculosis) is that this will release additional funding around the world to combat airborne infections. If Covid-19 is globally recognised as caused by an airborne virus, there will be more of an imperative to fund research and initiatives, such as improving indoor ventilation, that will be crucial to preventing the spread of this virus and others like it.

Emphasising that Covid-19 can be spread through the air would allow us to add more weapons in our arsenal to fight this virus – which may be with us for some time to come.",10/28/20 0:00,
"Covid has hit England's older people hardest. This time, we need better care | Dorothy Byrne","At the height of the first wave of the pandemic, I devised what I regarded as a cunning plan. Should I develop severe Covid-19 symptoms requiring hospitalisation, I would not reveal my true age, 68, to the NHS helpline or to paramedics, nor the fact I had an auto-immune condition and a low white blood cell count. Instead, I would pretend to be 55, with no other illnesses.

All my friends thought this was a ridiculous and immoral idea. Of course, I would never have gone through with this plan. But I suspect that I’m not the only older person who has feared being denied life-saving treatment for coronavirus. One friend, a woman of my exact age who developed several severe Covid symptoms, was denied admission to our local hospital by paramedics, despite passing out twice at home. Only when her daughter found her unconscious on the floor was she finally admitted.

During the beginning of the pandemic we were often told that the priority was protecting elderly people from infection. This was the reason even young and healthy people wore masks and followed lockdown rules. Policies aimed at preventing the virus from spreading were a collective commitment to protecting the vulnerable in our society.

Yet a different story seemed to be unfolding in the health service. As the pandemic wore on, people spoke of elderly Covid patients who were sent home to die as there was “no clinical benefit” to treating them in hospital. Some older patients were discharged to care homes, which subsequently became hotspots for the virus, without Covid-19 tests, and some people were denied acute care because they were deemed too frail. As a recent Sunday Times investigation reported, some older patients were denied life-saving treatment for coronavirus because they “ticked too many boxes” under the triaging guidelines allegedly used in some hospitals.

According to the investigation, some hospitals in regions such as London, Manchester and Liverpool, placed in the impossible position of needing to keep patient numbers down, allegedly applied an age-based scoring system to decide whether or not patients should receive life-saving treatment. And at the height of the pandemic, the percentage of coronavirus patients aged 60 and above receiving intensive care plunged by almost half.

The Department of Health says this guidance was never implemented – and that claims of patients being prevented from receiving necessary care are “false”. But another of my friends, a consultant at a major London hospital, has told me that some people in their mid- to late 60s who had other medical conditions were “de-prioritised” for intensive care in her hospital. She said that it was quite possible that a patient like me might indeed have been denied intensive care.

There’s nothing new about this picture. In recent years, reports have exposed the raw deal that older patients receive in our health service. As one 2012 study from Age UK and the Royal College of Surgeons put it: “Whilst a patient’s health needs – including conditions that could be treated by surgery – increase with age, planned (elective) surgery rates decline steadily for people as they grow older.” This gap between people’s increasing health needs and their access to surgery means “many older people are missing out on potentially life-saving treatment”.

Another report from the Royal College of Surgeons and Age UK in 2014 found that age discrimination in the NHS may be preventing older people from accessing life-saving surgery. The report, which analysed surgery rates across England’s 211 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) for six procedures that are known to be effective in older people, found that a number of CCGs had very few people in the over-75 age group who received surgery for procedures including breast excision, gallstones, hernia repair, colorectal incision and knee replacements.

Covid-19 is still worsening health inequality. Why hasn't anything been done? | Gurch Randhawa Read more

It’s been older people too who have been most affected by the decision to postpone non-urgent operations and treatments during the pandemic. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that 31% of people over 70 say that their access to healthcare and treatment for non-coronavirus related issues is being affected.

They have been particularly hard hit by the reduction in face-to-face GP appointments. I’m vice-chair of the national charity for people with polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis, PMRGCAuk, and a number of our older members say they just can’t get an appointment with their GP or their consultant. One member recently told us that they hadn’t been able to get an appointment with their hospital consultant for a year.

Other charities are also worried. Breast Cancer Now is concerned that screening self-referrals for women over the age of 70 have been put on hold while the NHS catches up with a huge backlog of women still waiting for mammogram appointments. A quarter of breast cancer cases are diagnosed in women aged 75 and over; in this age group, the rate of breast cancer detections is over three times higher than in women aged 45-49 after screening. Stopping self-referral appointments isn’t just distressing for older women – it’s potentially dangerous.

So little was known about Covid-19 in the first wave that it’s easy to understand why the health service, overwhelmed by the number of coronavirus cases, was faced with difficult decisions about whose care to prioritise. As Caroline Abrahams, director of Age UK, told me, “What’s really important is that we see much better practice everywhere, in the second wave.”

But it’s also vital, if hard choices have to be made, that the public is informed of the basis for these decisions, and whose care will be prioritised. We old folk noted Donald Trump’s recovery. Aged 74, clinically obese, allegedly demented: what treatment could he have expected from the NHS?

"Race is clearly a factor in Covid deaths, but the UK government is in denial | Winston Morgan","Since the start of the pandemic the government has produced a series of reports on the impact of Covid-19. One statistic that has received a lot of attention is its disproportionate impact on the Black and Asian populations. While there has been general agreement about the data – that where you live, the number of people in your household, the type of job you do, how you travel to work and a range of co-morbidities, are the main contributors to death from Covid-19 – there has been a reluctance in these reports to mention the role of race in any meaningful way.

Following the publication of the report on Covid-19 health disparities in June, the minister for equalities, Kemi Badenoch, supported by the Race Disparity Unit (RDU), was put in charge of cross-government work on the next steps. Yet this race unit, selected by No 10, includes a number of Black and Asian people who appear little inclined to attribute any disparities based on race to discrimination. Badenoch herself, though a black woman, accused a BBC journalist of fanning racial tensions simply for exposing the impact of Covid-19 on Britain’s racial minorities. The government sponsored report is in stark contrast to the report commissioned by Labour, and authored by Doreen Lawrence, which boldly states that structural racism led to worse Covid-19 impact on ethnic minority groups.

The first report to the minister on how Covid-19 health inequalities were being addressed was published last week, and it represents a clear attempt by the minister and the RDU to deny that racism plays any role in coronavirus deaths. This is problematic because racism is not a matter of opinion, but a statistically measurable fact.

Structural racism led to worse Covid impact on BAME groups – report Read more

The government’s position that structural racism plays no role in Covid-19 deaths requires us to conveniently forget the data on the disproportionate impact of the virus on certain groups. When combined with narratives of the victims presented in June’s Public Health England report on the impact of Covid-19 on Black, Asian and minority-ethnic communities, this is prima facie evidence of structural racism. The latter, led by Prof Kevin Fenton, noted: “Stakeholders pointed to racism and discrimination experienced by communities and more specifically by Bame key workers as a root cause affecting health, exposure risk and disease progression.”

Yet a government Covid-19 adviser, Dr Raghib Ali, dismissed Fenton’s conclusions that structural racism had to be considered, arguing that the PHE report was informed not by “objective evidence” but by the views of the stakeholders who had been interviewed. In other words, the government’s appointed expert was effectively dismissing the lived experiences of racism of those affected by Covid-19. This suggests a serious lack of understanding of the meaning of racism.

Governments on both sides of the Atlantic have long been reluctant to accept that any racial inequality is caused by structural racism: it goes against everything they claim to stand for as liberal democracies. Any acknowledgement of the existence of racism would be seen as a failure of government, so instead they prefer denial.

Further, Ali was across the media last week defending the latest report, arguing that if structural racism was at play then we would see these effects for other medical outcomes, not just for Covid-19. This ignores the fact that co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are more prevalent in racial-minority groups; and there is extensive evidence that these co-morbidities are linked to deprivations associated with structural racism, as is the fact that Black women are five times more likely to die during childbirth than white women.

It’s true that, prior to the pandemic, life expectancy among some Black and Asian groups was slightly higher than for white people. But comparing death from Covid-19 – an acute event – to life expectancy is not comparing like with like. Ironically, the reason why life expectancy is slightly higher for Black and Brown people is identical to why the same groups suffer more from Covid-19. Black and Brown older people are more likely to live in multi-generational, multiple-occupancy households: regular contact with family members and friends is known to increase life expectancy.

If ministers and their advisers cannot understand the real causes of the disproportionate deaths of Black and Brown people from Covid-19, one has to wonder how they can possibly prevent it in the second wave.

Wales's Covid competence is inspiring many of us to thoughts of independence,"On Friday Wales began a two-week national “firebreak” Covid lockdown in an attempt to give some breathing space to its health service, which risks being overwhelmed by the rise in cases. It has not been without controversy – a ban on supermarkets selling non-essential items was criticised over the weekend. In the English press, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, and the Welsh government have been labelled as “clowns” who are trying to turn Wales “into a wartime, command economy: East Germany, except not as efficient, and with more sheep” (note the tedious xenophobia).

The criticism over the essential items rule is less about lockdown and more about what individuals consider “essential” during times of crisis (the government has now indicated that supermarkets will be allowed flexibility – hardly the actions of a Soviet dictatorship).

Speaking to friends and family in Wales, most people feel the Welsh government knows what it is doing. It is following the scientific advice from its own Technical Advisory Cell, as well as from experts on the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). That is not to say that restrictive lockdowns are easy on anyone – small businesses are worried they will not survive – but there is faith that the government has the best interests of the people at heart and is doing what it can to bring case numbers down. Compliance with measures such as mask-wearing has been high, adding to a feeling of collective dedication to the nation’s wellbeing.

As a Welsh person on the other side of the border, I can’t help but feel a bit jealous of my loved ones still living there. It must be nice to have a government you trust, which collaborates with other parties and with the public, and communicates through clear, carefully considered announcements. The lockdown may be restrictive – and will certainly be experienced differently in Cardiff and Swansea than it will in the Valleys or the villages of Snowdonia – but wherever you are in Wales, you can be sure the scientific advice is being followed. In England, people do not have that luxury. The Tories looked at the same advice, and rejected it.

Of course it is hard. My mother and one of my brothers, who is autistic, live close to one another but on different sides of the border. Because my brother was already in a regional lockdown, he hasn’t seen my mother for weeks, and I haven’t seen him since Christmas. As for my dad, stepmum and youngest brother: who knows when I’ll next see them. To miss your loved ones like this is a pain I’d never experienced before, but it is offset by the knowledge that their country is doing what it can to protect them.

Throughout all this, I have noticed a shift in how Wales is perceived by Welsh people, in whichever country they live. Though I always saw Wales as a distinct nation, I have never spent so much time thinking about the border before. For most of my life it has felt porous: now it is not so.

The measures banning travel into Wales are anti-virus, not anti-people. Covid poses a threat to small, rural populations with high numbers of older people, especially after the summer tourist season. Despite jokes on social media, Welsh people aren’t hoping to “build a wall”: they just want to keep the disease at bay.

The way we conceive of the land of our birth is shifting. A friend in Gwynedd says he never felt such a strong sense of Welshness before the pandemic. There’s a sense of pride, too, in how Welsh people have come together to support laws made for Wales by Wales, while Westminster flounders, bluffs and fosters division. The Covid-19 crisis has exposed the benefits of devolution: the powers Wales has to enact protective measures were previously unknown to many of us – even the former first minister Carwyn Jones said he had been unaware Wales could impose its own quarantine rules on people arriving from elsewhere. The pandemic has also allowed the Welsh government to take its own moral stand on issues close to the public’s heart: last week, the Senedd voted to ensure free school meal provision for school holidays up to and including Easter 2021.

Support for independence is rising, too, and there are now “indy-curious” Labour voters. YesCymru, the campaign for an independent Wales, has seen huge increases in support. “People have seen that the Senedd in Wales is much more competent at running Wales’s affairs than Westminster, and we can do so with more empathy and compassion as well,” Siôn Jobbins, chair of YesCymru, tells me. “We’ve seen how a small country like New Zealand has succeeded in tackling Covid-19 even though Wales’s tax intake per head is higher than theirs, and they don’t ‘benefit’ from any of the so-called advantages of Westminster rule.”

Jobbins says that 2021 will be an interesting year in the nation’s history. Welsh people will be keenly watching Scotland and wondering what life will be like being tethered to England following a potential Scottish departure. “Westminster is already stripping the Welsh parliament of its powers through the internal market bill,” Jobbins says. “In a few years’ time, Wales will either be independent or incorporated into England with direct Westminster rule – devolution won’t hold.”

Covid-19 has given Wales a glimpse of what self-determination and autonomy could look like, and it’s inspiring. In times of great fear and uncertainty, having politicians that you feel you can trust is no small thing, and is not easily forgotten.

Lockdown rules won’t be respected if they prioritise business over human relationships,"For anyone adjusting to the rules set out under the government’s three-tier system for England, it won’t come as a surprise that they fail to match up with our lives. A “care gap” has emerged caused by regulations and guidelines in which people are severed from extended family, friendship and care connections.

A national conversation about the care gap began in May with a public outpouring of anger after Dominic Cummings’ trip to Durham and his claim of “exceptional circumstances” justified by childcare needs. In research into care work during lockdown for the London School of Economics (LSE), my colleagues and I found that this was a turning point in people giving up on government rules. They were anguished that they had sacrificed their own ties for so long, but they were also given implicit permission by Cummings’ example to prioritise these ties above all else.

Families found creative ways to bend regulations as social restrictions eased. For example, since paid cleaners and nannies were allowed into homes but not relatives or friends, people simply paid a token amount to grandparents or fellow mothers. People broke the rules because of the intense emotional sacrifices they involved. The rules seemed unethical too because they prioritised financial relationships over those of caring ones. Eventually, due to campaigns by Ella Davis for single parents, and by Carers UK, families were allowed to link to one other single person household.

Under the English tier 2 and 3 restrictions, we have not returned to the extremes of the last national lockdown with exceptions for childcare bubbles, support bubbles with a lone person household, and essential care provision and support groups. The government has obviously learned that care matters, but it has not yet understood that people are unlikely to respect rules that break essential bonds by banning household mixing outside of one limited support bubble.

In places high on the index of multiple deprivation, it has become clear that, across all communities, interventions in households make little sense. Among disadvantaged and minority ethnic communities, family and friendship are broad and include several households, with sometimes more than six people living in a single household. Paid childcare and eldercare are rare because of cost and instead caring within family and friendship circles are valued. These capacious networks don’t fit into the new rules. The rules are seen as “nonsense”, especially when there are greater limits placed on these ties in tier 2 and tier 3 than on economic activities. They quite simply do not make sense in terms of our moral compass, meaning that some people choose to bypass them rather than denying their family or friends the vital care they need.

When people try to follow the rules, they experience emotional strains in navigating them. The majority of people we spoke to had faced mental health issues for the first time. Women in particular have worked hard to support others, with a “squeezed middle” of midlife women developing, who juggle the dilemmas of caring for children, young adults and elderly people. One 50-year-old woman said, “Mental effects were starting to show after three months despite the fact that I am a perfectly healthy person.” mother from London explained: “I have been the only carer to my two children with no break as friends and family can’t help. I haven’t been able to care for my elderly parents. This has driven me to the edge of my emotional reserves.” It is important to remember that these stresses have never ended in parts of the country that were kept under restrictions such as Leicester and Blackburn.

What could be done about the impracticality of the rules? Our research suggests that the government should only severely restrict household interaction in tier 3. New social-bubble and rule-of-six policies could instead be introduced. These would dial up and down the levels of social interaction in terms of numbers of households connecting according to the severity of local outbreaks. In tier 1, up to four households of any size could form a social bubble. In tier 2, three households of any size.

During circuit-breakers or national restrictions we would have to return to tighter rules, with regular connections between the same group of six people to create limited caring networks. That could be one elderly relative being looked after by his two adult children and their partners, or two friends helping with the childcare of one family of four.

More household-centred, realistic rules would be likely to gain greater compliance and respect among all segments of the UK public. fears about transmission in unregulated private spaces could be overcome by a public health campaign about Covid-safer behaviours in homes, specifically for self-isolation, multiple household interactions and domestic work. Caring has never been so important and so at risk.

Why lockdown was the plot twist that libraries needed | Krystal Vittles,"When we closed the doors on Suffolk’s libraries earlier this year, some staff shed a tear. Lockdown was hard for everyone – and hearing that a few librarians struggled as their workplaces were shuttered, their colleagues were furloughed, and the range of services they’d worked hard to lay on on were frozen, might induce a cry of “Come on, it’s just books!” But for librarians it is never “just books”. We like to say we are “books AND …” a space for mothers to catch their breath while their kids romp around or take part in a reading group, for pensioners to come and read the paper, and for those who might have no one else to speak to to share a smile, a “hello” while they pick up a new book. A warm, safe space for anyone who seeks to find it.

Since they were a lifeline for so many people, the closure of libraries certainly had a significant impact on local communities. That “AND …” seemed in danger of withering away. But my fellow librarians’ despair was brief, as public libraries are nothing if not resourceful. Despite the horrors unfolding, we rapidly came to see that lockdown presented an opportunity to us. We could not offer our full service with our physical locations closed, but we instinctively understood we could bolster some elements and deliver others in a different way. Our mission was to reach out to people beyond the four walls of the library buildings.

Library ebook lending surges as UK turns to fiction during lockdown Read more

It is often said librarians suffer from a marketing issue. This is a profession hardwired not to boast about itself. But lockdown forced us to confront and subvert this mindset to ensure that people knew that we were still very much functioning and there were plenty of ways to access our services. A new report by the Carnegie UK Trust shows how successful these efforts were. It found that one in three people in the UK engaged with libraries during lockdown, despite the closures. It seems libraries didn’t just speak up, but nigh on shouted out during lockdown, and we are determined to maintain this noise as the country begins to reopen.

A substantial part of this success came through a significant increase in ebook borrowing – with 465,200 digital issues between April and July – a pattern reflected across the country, according to figures from Libraries Connected. Feedback from eLibrary users ranged from “thank you for still providing something” to “I never knew I could get all of this for free!” We had hundreds of new signups to these digital services.

Book clubs, cooking classes and craft workshops moved online too. Our early-years session facilitators switched classes to Facebook Live. Storytimes for children took on a whole new interactive edge, with mums and dads sending in comments asking for shoutouts for their child – which the kids loved. A colleague who hosted one of these groups was recognised in the local supermarket and felt like a celebrity.

We have also had a network of local volunteers delivering books, creativity packs and food parcels. Frontline colleagues made more than 8,000 calls to vulnerable library users through our Lifelines service, set up in response to the pandemic in May to make contact with our regular users who were now unable to come in.

The response we’ve had has been a mix of utter joy and gentle heartbreak. Rich stories have surfaced of colleagues going the extra mile. Librarians in Ipswich made a bespoke audio recording of Portrait of Clare by Francis Brett Young for 102-year-old Doris, who recalled the novel from her childhood when chatting to staff on the phone. Hearing these stories, I knew we had stumbled on something wonderful. As a county-wide service, we have committed to keeping the best of these things going once we reopened.

We reopened our doors on 7 July with a new “select and collect” service, offering borrowers the chance to order a selection of books picked for them by library staff based on their interests. Since then, other services have been rolling out slowly and our libraries are now offering browsing and computer usage. Visitor numbers are not what they were, and we have to limit numbers due to social distancing, but people are slowly finding their way back to us as they emerge into the world. We are again shouting about the fact we are open. We plan to get back to our full range of activities once it is safe to do so, but until then we will keep using our imaginations to reach people in their homes.

UK libraries are set to reopen – but not as we know them Read more

There is a storm facing the country as it emerges from lockdown – made up of economic, social and health crises. I believe that all the services public libraries offer – digital and physical – will be needed to help communities weather this. In these difficult times, people will be looking for trustworthy and accurate help and advice, which has always been at the core of what a library does.

It would be easy to say that by proving we can exist in a digital capacity, libraries might be shooting themselves in the foot. I am often asked what the future of library buildings is, and my honest response is that despite the impressive things we have achieved remotely, nothing replaces the person-to-person connection found in a library. The queues outside testify to this, and more than 250,000 physical books have been borrowed since reopening. We are not about to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

The future possibilities for public libraries are, well, not endless exactly, but the list is long, varied and thrilling. Like all library services we have taken our fair share of cuts over the years and we have saved close to 40% of the original libraries budget since 2011. I won’t lie – it has been a bumpy road these past 10 years as we’ve had to make tough decisions, but we are resilient, and we have grit. I have resisted the urge to use any tired library cliches, but here’s one to end on: post-lockdown, an exciting new chapter for public libraries awaits.

"In the restaurant where I work, Covid has brought out the worst in customers","Waitressing can be a difficult job at the best of times. The hours are long, the work is exhaustingly physical and the customers have a tendency to take out on you whatever frustrations have been building in them all week.

I fondly remember one weekend brunch shift when a woman berated me because we only had white sugar for her coffee, not brown; she insisted that this was a breach of “etiquette”. She was definitely not sweet enough.

I took the job last summer as a way to make ends meet while I started a new life in Manchester after moving from London. It wasn’t exactly what I’d trained for in drama school, but it paid the bills and I love being around people. I took the good customers with the bad, and found solace venting with my partner at the end of the day.

Then Covid hit. We endured the closure of the restaurant due to lockdown along with the rest of the country, but from July onwards we were lucky enough to be able to set up an ad hoc outdoor space for customers. It was a relief to be able to keep the place open and all we asked of customers was to register with the Covid app, wear a mask when they entered the indoor area and stay seated as we provided table service. Maybe waitressing would even become easier, I thought, as groups were restricted to no more than six. Surely this would be a simple enough bargain to make in order for us all to stay safe while enjoying a return to some semblance of our normal lives?

Yet since customers have started to stream back through our doors, I have been faced with a different reality. When I greet them and ask them to scan the test-and-trace app barcode, many will ignore me or say they don’t have their mobile phones with them, only to sit down and put their phones on the table. It’s not just my restaurant that faces this sort of attitude; one of my favourite places to eat in the city was given a two-star review by a customer complaining about being asked to register on the app. Apparently the place was “brim with ridiculous rules and concepts”. Tell that to Boris Johnson, love, not the service staff.

As we’ve moved into tier 2 and now tier 3, we have had to be alert to groups of more than one household turning up. Despite the rules, it’s patently obvious that we’re receiving parties of mixed households, unless communal living has really taken off in Manchester. There is only so much we can do: I can’t ask to see their house keys, or quiz them on each other’s preferred breakfast cereal. The rules are unsustainable and shouldn’t be our responsibility.

Then there’s making sure people are wearing their masks to keep each other and staff like me safe. You’d think we were taking away people’s right to vote by asking them to pop a piece of cloth over their face while they nip to the toilet. All of this would be bad enough, but to compound issues, management have decided that the maxim “the customer is always right” endures, despite staff going no further than enforcing government regulations.

When you eventually get everyone seated, you hope that the hard work is behind you. But then comes the shouting across the room to get your attention, and the eyes boring into your head as you finish up serving another customer. I’ve cried in work more than once because of the way a customer has treated me.

In hospitality there’s always that one difficult customer, but nothing could prepare me for life post-lockdown. We all want to get back to normal and it can feel frustrating at times, but this situation has truly brought out the worst in people. If you plan to go out this week, please remember to be polite to your waiting staff: they’re living through exactly the same pandemic as you.",10/25/20 0:00,
The Guardian view on a second lockdown: what took him so long?,"Here we are again. Once more, England will enter lockdown on Thursday, albeit somewhat less restrictive than the one in spring, with schools remaining open. Once more, the government has been far too slow to act. After so many errors by Boris Johnson, fresh ones are lamentable; making the same one is unforgivable.

Already, we have seen hundreds of deaths a day. The government’s Sage committee of experts has warned that Covid-19 could claim 85,000 lives this winter. On Saturday, the chief medical officer for England and the chief scientific adviser warned that without tighter restrictions the NHS could be overwhelmed within weeks. In the prime minister’s words: “Doctors and nurses would be forced to choose which patients to treat … Who would live and who would die.”

Mr Johnson declared that “now is the time to take action”. But his decision came a month and a half after Sage urged a short “circuit breaker” lockdown, and weeks after this column and Sir Keir Starmer made that call. Opposition in his party, his own libertarian instincts and his inability to get a grip on serious issues saw Mr Johnson attack the Labour leader for “want[ing] to turn the lights out”. Now he is imposing a stay-at-home order until at least 2 December, and perhaps longer.

No one wants a second lockdown. Many, with good reason, truly dread it. As Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust noted, second waves are usually tougher: everyone is worn out – healthcare workers most of all – and the effort can feel hopeless. It will be hardest of all for those already hard-hit, through lack of resources or for physical or mental health reasons.

But the alternative is much worse. Not many of us are willing to brush aside a high death toll and the serious health problems associated with “long Covid”. In any case, the false dichotomy presented, of a choice between lives and livelihoods, pretends that the economy can thrive while coronavirus tears through the country. What is truly depressing for many people is not lockdown in itself, but the growing conviction that this government has no exit plan, and no ability to execute one even if they stumble across it. True, Covid-19 has resurged across the continent (though many Asian nations have so far done well in suppressing it). But England recorded the highest level of excess deaths in Europe in the first wave and has continued to flounder.

The furlough extension is welcome and necessary. But the 11th-hour U-turn comes after redundancy decisions have been made and has caused anger in northern England, Wales and Scotland. The government’s incompetence has cost jobs as well as lives. It is not yet clear how the self-employed will be helped. The shoddy manner of Saturday’s announcement – with the prime minister addressing the public only after selected journalists had been briefed – has fuelled resentment.

This lockdown will save lives, and the more assiduously people respect it, the more quickly and effectively it will work. The public has so far proved markedly more responsible than those leading the country. But every government failure saps the morale, goodwill and sense of purpose on which compliance depends. The next month offers an opportunity to get the virus under control, not just briefly, but in the longer term. Mr Johnson and his team must use it to fix contact tracing and establish a more sensible and measured plan for exit from lockdown this time. They have given us no reason to believe that they will do so. But they, and we, cannot afford more mistakes.",11/1/20 0:00,
The Guardian view on Tories and migration: stop the posing | Editorial,"The drowning of a family of five in the Channel and a fire on a ship off the coast of Senegal should prompt action – ‘thoughts and prayers’ are not enough

“We don’t see migration as a problem at all: we see people dying at sea as a problem and the existence of the mafias as a problem.” Such was the view expressed last week by Hana Jalloul, secretary of state for migration in Spain. Days earlier, more than 140 people had died off the coast of Senegal, after their ship caught fire and capsized, in the deadliest shipwreck recorded this year. Ms Jalloul spoke of efforts to support the regional government of the Canary Islands, which is struggling to cope with the number of arrivals, and stressed her determination to combat organised crime. She also pointed to migrants’ crucial role in Spanish life, including as care workers during the pandemic.

British politicians could profit from studying her example in the aftermath of the drowning of a family of four Kurdish Iranians in the Channel. (A fifth member of the same family, aged 15 months, is missing and presumed dead.) Reports of the deaths of Rasul Iran Nezhad, Shiva Mohammad Panahi and their children drew forth platitudes from the home secretary, Priti Patel, about “thoughts and prayers”. But nothing said by her or Boris Johnson did anything to dispel the impression that their attitude to people trying to reach the UK to seek asylum is chiefly antagonistic. While Ms Patel repeated her opposition to “callous criminals exploiting vulnerable people”, there was no serious attempt to sympathise with the migrants’ desperation – or acknowledge that their reliance on smugglers is a matter not of accident but of political choice.

On the contrary, recent weeks have seen Ms Patel adopt extraordinarily hostile language towards lawyers representing migrants, as well as towards smugglers. A week ago, senior judges were among several hundred signatories to a letter complaining that her denunciation of “lefty lawyers” had put people at physical risk. The letter followed reports of a man charged with preparing an act of terrorism after attacking an immigration law firm’s office.

It isn’t too late for ministers to change course. The Labour peer Alf Dubs’ amendment to their immigration bill would allow unaccompanied children to be reunited with family in the UK after the transition period ends on 31 December. The UK’s refugee resettlement scheme must also be restarted as soon as the new lockdown ends. It was supposed to provide a safe way in for up to 5,000 of those fleeing persecution, but was suspended due to the pandemic.

It is right that those who profit from smuggling people across borders must be tackled. But it is cynical to portray the problem as one created by people smugglers while denying the need for viable options. Collapsing fish populations and the climate crisis are among reasons for increased migration from Senegal and the Sahel region of Africa. The war in Syria and ongoing violence in Iraq continue to force people to flee the Middle East. The victims of these disasters must not be blamed.

Responsible politicians would address the causes as well as symptoms. They would also keep a sense of proportion, and enjoin the public to do the same. The number of asylum applications in the UK (35,566 in 2019) is a small fraction of that in France and Germany; Turkey is home to around 4 million refugees. But again and again, the UK government chooses hostile posturing over rational policy based on international cooperation, respect for the law and human rights. Could the deaths of three children lead Ms Patel to give it a rest and listen to European politicians such as Ms Jalloul, or even Lord Dubs? Don’t hold your breath.",11/1/20 0:00,
The Observer view on the US election,"The US presidential election on Tuesday is the most momentous in recent modern history. It is a referendum on the personality and leadership of Donald Trump after four extraordinary, disgraceful years. It is a referendum, too, on the future of democracy in America, which appears more imperilled now than at any time since the civil war. Also at issue is America’s future role in the world. Not since 1940 has the US been so isolated and out of step on the key issues of the day.

The very idea that an American election, normally a grand, exemplary expression of the popular will, could be reduced to being about one man is, at some level, obscene. Yet how could it be otherwise? Selfishness, egotism and narcissism are the Trump trademarks. From his first hours in the Oval office, when he lied about the size of his inauguration crowd, Trump has made governing all about him. For this vain, self-obsessed man, the Hail to the Chief presidential anthem should be retitled Hail to Me.

Ruling by rancour, fear and vindictive whim and wholly lacking moral principle, Trump has demeaned, abused and shamed the office to which he was undeservedly appointed in 2016 after losing the popular vote. He has ruled more like a corrupt potentate or mafia boss than a servant of the people. Falsehoods and duplicity are his stock in trade. Firings and humiliations of officials who displease him are the norm. Instead of experts, he surrounds himself with lickspittles and relatives.

The Trump presidency, designed from the first to glorify himself and secure a second term, spawned horrendous behaviour. Trump banned Muslims, locked migrant children in cages, militarised the Mexican border, slashed taxes for the wealthy, attacked women’s rights, vandalised the environment, praised white supremacists, excused police violence, promoted hate and sent troops against American citizens. When faced by a real crisis – the pandemic – his phoney leadership was exposed. More than 228,000 tombstones bear witness to his criminal neglect.

Domestic policy achievements there were virtually none. What Trump did do, however, was try to bend America’s democratic institutions to his will. He packed the supreme court and federal bench with ultra-conservatives. He circumvented Congress, opposed lawful scrutiny and sacked independent government watchdogs. He claimed to be a believer, to dupe Christian voters. He insulted and endangered the military. And he constantly undermined confidence in a free press.

Under Trump, the rule of law in America has become a very uncertain proposition. His pardoning of convicted associates, his 2016 campaign’s unscrupulous collusion with Russia (detailed in the Mueller report), his monetising of his position for personal gain and his chronic tax-dodging proved mere preliminaries to the biggest, most egregious breach of trust of all.

This ultimate betrayal of the American people came in the form of a clumsy attempt to induce Ukraine’s president to help him smear his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, by illegally withholding bilateral aid. Rejecting indisputable evidence of wrongdoing, Trump lied and lied, even as his chief of staff admitted it all. Trump was rightly impeached. To the Republicans’ great shame, he was acquitted.

Biden is a decent, honest, experienced man who will do his best to reunite a divided nation. And he’s not Donald Trump

Emboldened, Trump has since actively conspired to prevent a free and fair election. He and his Republican allies have gerrymandered constituencies, pursued vote suppression measures and obstructed mail-in ballots. They claimed that Democrats were stealing the vote, an accusation more accurately levelled at them. To cap it all, Trump threatens to reject the election result. This is the kind of tyrannical behaviour Americans fought a revolution to defeat.

Four more years of Trump could prove fatal to US democracy and also to America’s place in the world. The president’s disdain for allies, his creeping and crawling to foreign dictators, his climate crisis denial and environmental hooliganism, his hostility to the UN and the WHO and his arrogant opposition to almost anything that smacks of sensible multilateral collaboration have greatly weakened US influence and leverage.

As at home, Trump personalised foreign policy, while remaining profoundly ignorant of the ways of the world. As a consequence, savvy operators such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu ran rings round him. Trump’s approach to China, the biggest challenger to US global leadership, has been wholly counterproductive, lurching from false bonhomie to dangerous hostility. His legacy abroad is one of weakness and discord.

Biden would halt this slide into infamy and sleaze and attempt an American restoration. He promises effective leadership to beat the pandemic and a huge financial package to boost the economy and save lives and jobs. He would make the climate crisis a top priority. He plans a new alliance of democracies to push back global authoritarianism. Biden is a decent, honest and experienced man who will do his best to reunite a divided nation. Crucially, he’s not Donald Trump.

For all these reasons and more, we hope Biden wins big and indisputably on Tuesday. The US and the world cannot afford any more of Trump’s malignity.",11/1/20 0:00,
Italy shows how easily Europe's leftwing strongholds can fall to the right | Rosa Gilbert,"“Europe is watching us”, declared La Nazione newspaper in Tuscany, the only Italian leftwing stronghold that the centre-left managed to retain in the 2019 European elections. This weekend, it was on the verge of having its first ever rightwing governor. Ultimately, Matteo Salvini’s anti-immigrant League party failed to capture Tuscany, but it would be a mistake for the continent to become complacent. That the right came so close in a “red region” betrays deep underlying issues in Italian politics and society, years in the making, which have parallels across the world.

Far-right Brothers of Italy close to snatching Marche region from left Read more

Italians went to the polls on Sunday and Monday to vote on a constitutional referendum to reduce the number of parliamentary seats by a third – an “anti-politics” populist proposal from the Five Star Movement and its centre-left coalition partners, the Democratic party. (It was approved by 70%.) In seven of Italy’s 20 regions, elections were also held to elect five-year administrations. The elections had been delayed since May due to the pandemic, and voting was held over two days to avoid crowds at polling stations and allow time for booths to be disinfected between people.

With decentralisation codified in its constitution, Italy’s individual regions hold a significant degree of power over public expenditure, education and healthcare. The regions’ differing responses to the pandemic played a significant role in these elections, with the incumbents in Veneto (centre-right) and Campania (centre-left) being re-elected by huge margins – effectively as vindications of their Covid-19 strategies. But the electoral race for governor in Tuscany is also a national story – one of the slow shrinking of the Italian left as it manages to just about hold Salvini and the League at bay, in large part due to their own miscalculations.

In March, as the world watched Italy’s struggle to contain the first European wave of Covid-19, Salvini’s personal ratings plummeted as he prevaricated; public trust grew in the government’s comparatively sober and consistent actions. (Salvini withdrew the League from the ruling coalition last year.) The League’s pro-privatisation management of the health system in Lombardy was blamed by many for the intensity of a crisis that was beamed on to television screens around the world. This is why it is concerning that just six months later the League, in coalition with the extreme right Brothers of Italy and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, would nonetheless be in contention in Tuscany, a region so proud of its role in the antifascist resistance that its Pegasus emblem is borrowed from the partisan flag.

Leftwing heartlands have been reorienting towards the right for years, in some cases due to the left’s failure to protect workers against the hollowing out of jobs and industry. After consolidating even larger majorities in its own heartlands such as Veneto, the right has overturned a large centre-left majority to win Marche for Brothers of Italy. It currently has 14 out of 20 regions; in 2015, that number was three. While the centre-right coalition was able to bringthe rightwing parties together, the left failed to do the same, with radical left and centrist contenders standing against the centre-left in Tuscany and Puglia. The radical left momentum against the Democratic party (PD) is at its lowest ebb, and with notable exceptions, it has been unable or unwilling to rejuvenate itself or make a meaningful crossover into parliamentary politics.

The close contest between right and left in Tuscany should ring alarm bells. Rather than campaigning on Salvini’s traditional lines of immigration and low taxes, the League in Tuscany ran on a platform of reversing healthcare cuts, investment in infrastructure and social housing. Though the outgoing governor, Enrico Rossi, responded to the pandemic with the free provision of face masks, blanket testing and measures of protection for care homes, healthcare cuts across the country have left it with fewer hospital beds than 10 years ago. EU-mandated austerity has been particularly harsh in Italy, and along with high debt-interest repayments, has resulted in huge underfunding of infrastructure, working against the incumbent left administrations, which even admit that the cuts they implemented were wrong. As the Labour party in the UK discovered last year, austerity is often blamed not on those who made the decision but those local authorities that carry it out. Italians earning less than they did a decade ago, faced with crumbling infrastructure, provide fertile ground for the right.

For now, the Italian left will breathe a sigh of relief. But with the extreme right becoming increasingly mainstream and the underlying causes of its success going unaddressed, Salvini’s dropped baton will easily be picked up by someone else – such as the leader of the Brothers of Italy, Giorgia Meloni, who is widely considered the new face of Italy’s far right. As in the UK and US, if the left aspires to do more than firefighting it must realise that an offer of more of the same is not going to hold off the right in a context where people are desperate for change.

Ventilation and masks are key to curbing Covid,"Julian Tang’s article on the airborne spread of Covid-19 and the need to prioritise control of aerosol spread of the virus (Understanding ‘aerosol transmission’ could be key to controlling coronavirus, 28 October) raises important issues about official guidance on social distancing, ie the 2 metre and 1 metre-plus rule.

This states: “Try to keep at least 2 metres away from people you do not live with … Where you cannot stay 2 metres apart you should stay more than 1 metre apart, as well as taking extra steps to stay safe. For example: wear a face covering … move outdoors … if indoors, make sure rooms are well ventilated by keeping windows and doors open.”

This advice clearly needs to be revised. While the risk is greatest near to an infected person, as Prof Tang says, virus-containing aerosols float through the air, and people further away could also become infected in poorly ventilated indoor spaces.

In my work as a GP with the NHS 111 Covid service, I have dealt with patients who have become infected indoors while observing 2 metre distancing, in the pub or at work behind Perspex screens, but not wearing masks. They were surprised to learn that the virus can spread through the air further than 2 metres. Social distancing is vital, but official guidance surely must now also say that we should improve ventilation and wear a mask at all times in indoor spaces with other people.

• Why does the government only emphasise washing, distance and masks, but never good ventilation? It has been obvious to me from the start that poorly ventilated interiors, such as in small shops, have atmospheres that are viral soups. The lack of emphasis on ventilation is insane.

It does have consequences. If my local chip shop has eight people standing 2 metres apart, what good is that if they are all breathing in virus-laden air? Or let’s say a father visits his daughter, goes through the house into the garden, and they stand 2 metres apart. If the daughter is infected, he will catch the virus while walking through the house; if he’s infected he’s spread the virus inside the house.

The government’s new motto should be “ventilation, ventilation, ventilation”. Open doors and windows, and try to achieve a through-draught. Don’t get into a cab if the windows are closed; don’t enter a shop if the front door is not open.

We need to urgently investigate how air-conditioning systems interact with the virus. That information will have enormous economic import in the near future.

• The Which? report (The face mask test: which are the best at limiting the spread of Covid?, 30 October) usefully draws our attention to the number of poor and excessively expensive masks now appearing on the market. It is a shame that the government, back in March, belittled the usefulness of masks in protecting against infection and transmission of the Covid virus.

The Which? filtration data is based on measurement of mechanical particle penetration and not on efficiency in use by humans, and takes no account of leakage during use. Better in vivo experiments have been carried out as long ago as 1975 (see my paper The Efficiency of Surgical Masks of Varying Design and Composition, British Journal of Surgery, vol 62), where it was shown that four-ply cotton muslin masks were 96.7% efficient in blocking bacterial infectious particles (after allowing for leakage), and actually improved on washing. This was a standard type of hospital mask at the time, and was better than four other mask types made from synthetic materials. In modern classification they would probably be rated FFP2.

There is now ample scientific evidence that this grade of mask not only protects patients against viruses in droplet infection but is as protective against respiratory viral infection as N95 (FFP3) respirators. A study published last year, N95 Respirators vs Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel, found no difference between the protection afforded to wearers of either the mask or the (top grade) N95 respirator.

To state that surgical-grade masks do not protect the wearer is simply false. The importance of every person in every contact situation wearing a proper mask cannot be overemphasised. After total isolation, it is the most important means of preventing transmission of aerial infection.

• Most years, around this time newspapers and magazines would soon be full of articles on how to cope with Christmas, about the pressure for perfection, the materialistic excess, the difficult in-laws, the drunken disputes and the ensuing debts. In the Covid environment, of course, everything seems different, so we find another way of longing for what we cannot have.

Talk of cancelling Christmas, that emotive phrase, must evoke a wry bitterness in those who have no family to see or who never meet up, for whatever reason, over the festive season. There is an irony in creating a hectic round of social engagements to mark the birth of one who came to bring peace to the world.

So perhaps we should use this year as an opportunity to simplify our celebrations, contact a friend or relative on their own and find a moment of quiet to contemplate the miracle of new life and the wonder of life itself. Even if it means the sacrifice of some happy moments, it will be worth it to save lives.

Test and trace: wasteful and worse than useless | Letters,"Instead of unqualified call handlers, why not make use of retired GPs to contact Covid patients, writes Dr David Maisey , while Louise Bradbury , Dora Wood and Dr Sylvia Berney are shocked at the waste of time and money

George Monbiot’s revelation that unqualified call handlers in the test-and-trace system are being inappropriately promoted to clinical contact case workers is astonishing (How teenagers ended up operating crucial parts of England’s test and trace system, 28 October. Has nobody in the Department of Health and Social Care, who requested Serco to initiate this, realised that there is a large pool of available, experienced people capable, with minimal training, of making phone calls involving clinical content to possibly distressed Covid patients? These are the tens of thousands of retired doctors in England; 28,000 retired or unlicensed doctors have been re-registered by the General Medical Council, but very few have since been employed.

There could be many more as the GMC set the maximum length of time since retirement at six years and this could be extended for this work. There is an even greater number of retired senior ward nurses who could be utilised. I am sure many doctors and nurses would take on this role for no reward other than the continued payment of their good NHS pensions and the feeling that they were playing a useful part in controlling the pandemic, so it could cost the government nothing.

• I tested positive for coronavirus on 11 October. I am a practising GP and have a daughter at a local sixth form. Two of my daughter’s year group had tested positive for coronavirus the previous week. My daughter tested positive on 13 October.

On 15 October I was contacted by test and trace. The caller asked how I was and advised me to call 111 if I was feeling unwell. She read from a script advising me of my legal obligations. No attempt was made to identify how I might have contracted the infection, nor indeed who I might have passed it on to. On learning that I was a GP, the caller asked for my opinion on face coverings and whether there was any point to them.

Three questions come to mind. Why has no attempt been made by a suitably qualified individual to identify the source of my infection or follow up potential contacts? Given the incidence of asymptomatic spread among teenagers, why was testing not offered to the whole of my daughter’s sixth form after two confirmed positive cases? And why is test and trace being staffed by people who are questioning government advice? Quite apart from the money being wasted, they could be doing more harm than good.

• As an NHS consultant, I have been alternately appalled and amused by my recent personal experience of the £12bn “world-beating” test-and-trace system. My husband tested positive for Covid on 24 October and subsequently received his first test-and-trace call. As there were no alternative phone numbers for our children he was told he would be called back three separate times so that he could be given the information for each of them individually, and this is indeed what happened.

Three other members of our household subsequently became unwell and tested positive and, in each case, all of the others were called again individually, the children on a parent’s phone number – 20 planned calls in all. We were told these would be repeated a further three times during our isolation period.

After the first day of fielding these, I set my phone to divert incoming calls from the 0300 number to voicemail. In less than two days I had 41 messages. It’s not preventing any Covid, but presumably all of this activity looks great for their numbers?

• My niece is a student in Manchester and, from June to August she got a holiday job, employed by Intelling to trace contacts of Covid cases. She had a day of training on how the system worked and what scripts to use. She worked four days on, four days off, on 12-hour shifts at £9.42 an hour. She had no calls for the first four weeks. In total, over three months, she contacted three cases, two of which went to voicemail. A great holiday job, but a monumental waste of taxpayers’ money and possible contributor to the failure to contain the virus.

"Golf, tennis and swimming in line for reprieves from Thursday's Covid ban","The government is considering a more flexible approach to outdoor sports banned as part of the new lockdown measures that will be introduced on Thursday. The Guardian understands that golf, tennis and swimming in particular are potentially in line for reprieves, with discussions ongoing at the highest levels about whether to allow sports to continue that can easily social distance.

A final decision is likely to be made in the next 24-36 hours and the revelation comes as the chief executive of England Golf, Jeremy Tomlinson, and that of the Lawn Tennis Association, Scott Lloyd, both hit out at the government’s plan and called for an immediate rethink.

Grassroots sport devastated by implications of England's new lockdown Read more

In an open letter to “fellow golfers”, Tomlinson took issue with protocols revealed by the prime minister on Saturday. “I would like to make clear England Golf’s intention to respectfully challenge the government’s rationale for closing golf courses. We will do so utilising all in our network – MPs, colleagues, media and friends – to make sure we are heard by government,” he said.

“Listening to the prime minister, the news that he is actively encouraging safe and responsible outdoor exercise for households or two individuals pointed to our great game of golf being at the heart of this policy. The guidance which followed stating that golf courses were on a list of venues which should close, therefore, appeared contradictory and came out of the blue.”

England Golf will not, however, like the precedent set in the Republic of Ireland. There, golf courses were closed under new Covid-19 restrictions announced on 19 October. Despite protests from golfing circles, the decision stood.

“At no point was England Golf – as the governing body for the amateur game of golf in this country – consulted about this decision,” Tomlinson added. “Of course we fully recognise and accept the need to suppress the virus to save lives and protect the NHS. Throughout the pandemic England Golf has endeavoured to act with authority, knowledge, understanding and extreme diligence.

“At all times we have placed the health and wellbeing of our communities as a priority. For this and many reasons it is our belief that it is counter-productive to shut down a healthy pursuit which naturally lends itself to social distancing and is played in a Covid-secure manner in the open air.”

In his statement, Lloyd said: “The new rules state that exercise and recreation outdoors is allowed with your household or on your own with one person from another household. Our concern is that it is not yet clear from the guidance whether outdoor tennis will be allowed to continue. So The LTA are making the strongest case to the government that outdoor tennis courts should be allowed to remain open for singles play, one-to-one coaching as well as use by the same households.

“Tennis is a safe, socially distant sport with the net acting as a natural barrier, and as such there is very low risk in terms of transmission of the virus. We believe if adults are allowed to meet someone else from their household for a socially distanced walk or conversation, they should be able to play tennis against each other from either side of a net.”",11/1/20 0:00,
The Breakdown | Covid-safe training camps will test players and coaches to their limits,"Players in Six Nations squads face six weeks in their biosecure bubble, and coaches must look after their mental wellbeing

When Steve Hansen was Wales’s head coach, their training base in the Vale of Glamorgan became known as the Jail of Glamorgan because of the way he operated as a prison warden, always checking to see if any of his players was trying to escape.

One morning, he confronted one of his charges after patrolling the car park before sunrise and discovering a motor with a warm bonnet and exhaust. It was Dafydd James, a Test player on the 2001 Lions tour, and when the wing did not admit having spent the night at home he was dropped for the next game.

Warren Gatland wants England players to ask clubs for early Lions release Read more

Hansen’s aim was not to punish players but change their behaviour after an indisciplined few years on and off the field. His ploy worked, although not until after he had returned to New Zealand, and these days players no longer feel incarcerated. That is, until they reported for international duty last week, seven months after coronavirus restrictions and regulations were introduced.

It will be the same all over Europe for the next six weeks with all the Six Nations in camp, first for the conclusion of the 2020 tournament and then the eight nations championship. No one is allowed to leave the squad’s hotel without prior permission, there is no room sharing, distance has to be maintained and hand sanitiser is ubiquitous. They cannot go for a stroll never mind find somewhere to cuddle a cappuccino.

Coaches have a dual role: preparing for Tests and making sure their players do not go stir crazy. The novelty of a different environment quickly wears off because of the restrictions on freedom. Other than back to the hotel room, there will be no refuge for someone who wants to be alone to digest being dropped from the side, for example.

Players are united by the cause they represent. They will not all get on and differences will be magnified by the stress brought on by having freedom curtailed. Squads are together for a long time with visits home strictly rationed. They will play in empty stadiums and, in their isolation, defeat will be harder for some to deal with.

The former England flanker James Haskell said he did not understand why more players did not seek the counsel of sports psychologists to ensure they are as fit mentally as they are physically. Sessions today would have to be conducted over the phone to avoid human contact, but a number may take his advice given they are dealing with circumstances peculiar to the current crop of internationals.

The ideal would be to turn hotels into cruise liners, offering a variety of entertainment and distractions as well as boltholes. “I am a passenger trying to make the most of what is on offer,” the England flanker Ben Earl said this week. “We have social groups who are organising entertainment and there should be no cabin fever after a couple of weeks.”

There is also the fear, heightened by the postponement of the game between England and the Barbarians at Twickenham last week, of testing positive for coronavirus and jeopardising a match with all the financial implications that entails at a time when unions and clubs are struggling, unable to sell tickets with no date even pencilled in for the return of spectators.

“You have to live with it,” said Earls. “If you are paranoid, you will not enjoy your time here. We know what is expected of us.” Which was not the case with some of the Barbarians, although most of the players involved in breaking out to visit a restaurant on one evening and a pub on the next had only experienced restrictions through a club prism.

It should not have mattered because most were experienced enough to know better, but a week with the Barbarians is to be transported back in time to the amateur era when bacchanalia was the rule rather than the forbidden. With the gift of hindsight, the Rugby Football Union may have thought that an old-fashioned trial match was a safer option than an old-school fixture.

As the number of positive tests throughout Europe goes up, so the risk grows if players step out of their bubble. “There are stringent measures, but we are still playing and doing what we love,” the England prop Harry Williams said. “Our sacrifice is minimal compared to what people throughout the country are having to do.”

It is all relative. Clubs and unions have this year made a number of positions redundant and, with the salary cap being reduced, players may find sacrifices come to amount to more than a drop in salary. Professional rugby, like so many other businesses, is moving closer to the edge, pushed by increasing debt.

The Premiership resumes in three weeks with clubs wondering why French sides are permitted to admit spectators, down from 5,000 to 1,000 after the spike in cases there, while they are not. Even with television income, there will be a point when staging a match becomes uneconomic. Delaying the start to the season would be tempting, but there is no space in the calendar.

It is the same with the Six Nations, although by February, surely, there will be some movement on spectators. It is against that backdrop that players have gathered in their respective international camps. Uncertainty is all that is certain and coaches will find themselves stretched like never before. They cannot be seen as jailers and success will come down to more than looking good in training.

Athletes and the US election: How a generation of stars got in the game,"They put in the long hours, did all the heavy lifting, prepared like never before – and all in anticipation for the biggest contest of the year: The one on 3 November.

That day, election day, is now less than a week away. Already, votes have been cast by a record 66 million-plus Americans, an astonishing draw that once seemed unfathomable during a pandemic. And while much of that sense of urgency stems from the 2020 presidential race – truly a life or death vote, in light of the ravages of Covid – the sense of purpose was shaped in no small part by the activism in sports. “Because of everything that’s going on, people are finally starting to listen to us,” LeBron James told the New York Times in June. “We feel like we’re finally getting a foot in the door.”

How the UFC became the sports arm of Donald Trump's Maga regime Read more

The big push started in March, with people the world over breaking quarantine to protest systemic anti-black racism in the wake of George Floyd’s unlawful killing in May at the hands of Minneapolis police. Meanwhile, scores of idle dribblers wondered if an on-court comeback might steal focus. In the end they did return but with assurances that social justice would become more centered in the overall spectacle. Hence how Black Lives Matter landed on NBA and WNBA courts and jerseys, and voter registration became the focus of recurring league PSAs. And when protests erupted again after Kenosha police shot Jacob Blake within an inch of his life three months later and the Milwaukee Bucks walked off of a play-off game and triggered a two-day sports blackout, one of the biggest concessions they won from their NBA partners was a pledge to convert some 20-odd league arenas into polling places in response to Donald Trump’s attempts to suppress and undermine in-person and mail-in balloting.

Last Saturday, on the first ever day of early voting in New York state, thousands of masked Manhattanites wrapped the streets and avenues around Madison Square Garden, with some waiting as long as five hours to cast their ballots. The scene was similar, if a bit more brisk, at the Golden 1 Center in Sacramento and at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte. That a team owned by someone as famously apolitical as Michael Jordan could have a hand in this historic election turnout is a welcome twist.

The kicker: he’s also written $2.5m-worth of checks to fight black voter suppression as part of a 10-year, $100m pledge to beat systemic racism – the clearest indicator yet of his evolution away from the neutral pitchman who hawked so many sneakers and colors of Gatorade in the ‘90s. “We understand that one of the main ways we can change systemic racism is at the polls,” he said in a July statement. “We know it will take time for us to create the change we want to see, but we are working quickly to take action for the Black Community’s voice to be heard.”

Still, you wonder if Jordan would’ve ever had such courage in his newfound convictions if James wasn’t giving as good as he gets from his critic-in-chief in the Oval Office in between weighing in on social justice issues in real time. As he was leading the Lakers to an NBA championship, he was huddling with a group of prominent athletes and entertainers to launch More Than a Vote, an organization aimed at informing, protecting and turning out Black voters.

When it comes to more acute impact, however, James and co have nothing on his female counterparts. When one of its owners, Kelly Loeffler, the junior Republican US senator from Georgia who owns half of the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream, took to the airwaves this past summer to disparage Black Lives Matter and the league for dedicating its season to the movement, players from her team and the opposing Phoenix Mercury took to the court before a nationally televised game in black T-shirts endorsing her Democratic opponent Raphael Warnock, leader of the Atlanta Baptist church where Martin Luther King once pastored.

The shirts quickly came into vogue league-wide. Within two days, Warnock’s campaign announced a $183,000 fundraising windfall – which helped launch a TV ad onslaught. In the last month Warnock has gone from polling slightly ahead of Loeffler at 31% to above 50% – which is right where he would have to be to avoid a January runoff. “It was one of many turning points in the campaign,” Warnock told USA Today Sports of the WNBA players’ endorsement. Nneka Ogwumike, the Los Angeles Sparks MVP forward and Player Association president, called it something else: “My favorite moment of the summer.”

That a group of athletes could be as persuasive in the political arena as they are commercially shouldn’t come as a surprise. Researchers at Wake Forest University launched a study into this very phenomenon this year and have already found the impact on political views of local and national matters to be significant, citing Colin Kaepernick’s hard-fought success in moving the needle on police reform as one example. “They’re influencing people to watch them,” said Betina Wilkinson, an associate professor of political science on the study. “They’re influencing people to buy the products that they’re selling, but then also now they have the ability to influence people’s views on issues regarding race such as immigration and criminal justice reform.” Meanwhile, the majority of respondents to a recent Politico study said Kaepernick’s activism inspired them to vote in a local, state or national election – and that’s with Kaepernick saying he didn’t vote in the 2016 election.

Gone are the days when an athlete’s impact on the democratic process was mostly incidental. You remember those “studies”: the gubernatorial race that was actually decided by a college football upset. The presidential election that was foretold by the “Redskin Rule”. Or the Super Bowl result. Or the Bears-Colts game.

These days, you’d be hard-pressed to turn on an NFL game without the Texans’ Deshaun Watson, Saints’ Cam Jordan and Seahawks coach Pete Carroll belittling the fact that only 60% of Americans voted in the 2016 presidential election as they encourage you to register to vote. For a league that oozes conservatism and genuflected to the president, whose demented causes aren’t helped by high voter turnout, this may as well be the equivalent of dumping tea into Boston Harbor. Even college football plays against type. Just last month, the NCAA’s Division I Council called for a blackout on practices and games on election day. All the while, athletic departments from Cal State LA to Yale have held registration drives with the goal of signing up all of their eligible athletes.

Clearly, we are now well past the era of athletes voting their bank accounts. Turns out, the money only goes so far. It didn’t spare them the inconvenience of being black or gay in America or otherwise labeled as different. So it figures that when their backs were against the wall, they banded closer together and found a collective resolve. That their impact can already be felt this far away from election day goes to show the hold athletes had on us all along. What’s more, that handle can only get tighter with more practice and progress in the years ahead.",10/29/20 0:00,
Covid: Boris Johnson faces Tory fury amid hints of further England lockdown,"‘No alternative’ to measures given threat from Covid second wave, PM will tell Commons

Boris Johnson will insist there is “no alternative” to a nationwide lockdown as he addresses the House of Commons on Monday amid mounting fury among Tory MPs, after ministers conceded the new “stay at home” order could be extended beyond 2 December.

The prime minister will tell parliament that without the draconian new measures, which will come into force across England on Thursday, deaths from coronavirus over the winter could be “twice as bad or even worse” than in the first wave.

He will promise the government will “seek to ease” restrictions when the measures are due to expire. However, cabinet minister Michael Gove made clear on Sunday they could be left in place if they have not yet brought the infection rate down sufficiently.

Gove said: “We’ve got this four-week period, during which we’re going to review progress, but of course we’ll always be driven by the data. We will always take a decision in the national interest, based on evidence.”

Pressed by Sophy Ridge on Sky News about whether that meant the measures could be extended, he said “yes”.

Sage member Jeremy Farrar, the chair of the Wellcome Trust, echoed Gove’s caution, saying it was important not to be too “fixed” about the 2 December end date.

If the infection rate, hospital admissions and other key metrics had not fallen far enough by then, he said, the measures should be extended. “Much better to do that than remove these restrictions and then have to impose even more draconian restrictions over Christmas or soon into the new year,” he told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show.

The latest official data showed that on Sunday, 23,254 people were tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK. A further 162 people had died within 28 days of a positive test.

Johnson will set out his plan to parliament after a chaotic weekend that saw his dramatic announcement brought forward after it was leaked on Friday evening, causing shock among his own backbenchers.

Amid forecasts that the economy could take a hit of up to 10% as a result of the new curbs, the Bank of England is poised to announce a fresh cash injection into the economy later this week.

The City had been expecting a resumption of Threadneedle Street’s quantitative easing programme even before the new lockdown was announced, but now sees a fresh support package as inevitable.

The Treasury plans to announce more generous support for the self-employed following the continuation of the furlough scheme for employees, but no further measures from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are currently planned.

Gerard Lyons, who was chief economic adviser to Johnson when he was mayor of London, said the lockdown was “terrible news” for the economy, which he said could shrink by up to 10%.

“This lockdown will ensure that a large section of the economy will be in a moribund state and will require huge new stimulus and help,” Lyons said.

Sunak had previously resisted a nationwide shutdown amid fears about its economic cost, but signed up to the plan in the face of the risk of hospitals being overwhelmed within weeks without action.

“If you have an NHS that’s not going to function, people are not going to be running off shopping, they’re going to stay at home. The economy gets crumpled anyway – and people lose faith in government,” said a Whitehall source.

Sunak’s abrupt decision to extend the furlough scheme, which pays 80% of workers’ wages in affected businesses, was met with fury among northern mayors, who repeatedly urged him to take the same approach when cities including Manchester and Liverpool were facing tough tier 3 restrictions last month.

“This morning millions of people woke up knowing the prime minister of this country believes the north is worth less than the south,” Steve Rotheram, the Liverpool city region mayor, said. “Quite frankly, the government has treated us with contempt again.”

Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, called for an end to the government’s “differential treatment” of people on low wages and “people in the north versus people in the south”.

Conservative MPs also lined up to criticise the government’s approach on Sunday. Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, told BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour that he will vote against the government’s lockdown measures in the vote on Wednesday.

Former Brexit secretary David Davis said he feared the lockdown would last until the spring, as the virus resurges.

“In March, Boris said let’s hope this will only last four weeks, and it lasted four months. My firm belief this time is it will last six months. Because when it gets to 2 December and R is still 1.5, which it will be, because this lockdown will hold less well than the last one, then it will have to continue.”

He said only countries that have aggressively pursued a “test, trace and isolate” approach, including drastic measures such as closing borders and separating those testing positive from their families in isolation wards, had managed to control it successfully.

Another former cabinet minister said they believed ministers had been left with little choice but to act, but the “shambles” of the weekend “could cost us dearly in the polls”.

Former minister George Freeman said he would support the government – but only on the basis of a clear strategy that would see more power handed to local leaders to balance health and economic risks in their areas in the future.

MPs will be given a vote on the measures on Wednesday, before they come into force – but they are likely to pass with Labour support, even if a significant number of Conservatives rebel.

The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, will urge the government to use the four-week lockdown period to fix the shortcomings in the test-and-trace system.

He will call for much more extensive “retrospective” contact tracing to identify the source of outbreaks, and urge the government to use new rapid saliva-based testing kits to carry out weekly screening of high-risk workers.

These should include NHS staff, as well as other at-risk workers such as those in education, transport, retail and hospitality, Ashworth will suggest.

“Coronavirus is growing with ferocity and urgent action is needed to bring the R below 1 nationwide which is why Labour urged Boris Johnson to use the opportunity of the half-term holiday for a time-limited ‘circuit break’,” he said.

“This didn’t happen, and test and trace have been overwhelmed. Controlling Covid-19 depends on fixing tracing, ensuring the quick turnaround of tests and introducing regular, weekly testing to identify the 70% of carriers who may not have symptoms but can still spread the virus.”

Speaking to MPs, Johnson will stand by his decision not to lock England down earlier as scientific advisers recommended in September – a choice Labour claims will have cost lives.

“I know some in the house believe we should have reached this decision earlier, but I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership,” the prime minister is expected to say.",11/1/20 0:00,
UK Treasury extends emergency business loan scheme,"Companies can request to ‘top-up’ their borrowing from next week

The Treasury is extending its emergency business loan scheme and will allow firms to “top up” their borrowing as part of new rules meant to keep businesses afloat during England’s second lockdown.

UK firms will now have until the end of January to apply for emergency business loans, including bounce back loans (BBLS), coronavirus business interruption loans (CBILS) and the CLBILS scheme for larger firms. That is two months longer than the existing 30 November deadline. The extension also applies to the Future Fund, aimed at UK startups.

“To help more businesses access additional support, deadlines for applications to our government-backed loan scheme and the Future Fund have been further extended until 31 January 2021,” the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said on Twitter.

Small businesses that already received funds through the 100% government-backed BBLS programme – which offers firms cheap loans worth up to £50,000 – will also be able to top up existing loans if they need additional cash.

The top-up is meant to help firms that borrowed less than the maximum sum available – up to 25% of their turnover to a limit of £50,000 – to avoid taking on extra debt. However, most firms made those calculations before the second lockdown in England was announced.

A government document outlining the changes said: “We understand that some businesses didn’t anticipate the disruption to their business from the pandemic would go on for this long; this will ensure that they are able to benefit from the loan scheme as intended.”

Firms will be able to request a top-up from next week but will only be able to do so once, according to the document. The bounce back loan scheme has so far distributed £40.2bn to 1.3m UK businesses.

The changes were announced only hours after the Treasury convened an emergency meeting with Britain’s largest banks – including HSBC, Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds – in order to review the terms of the government-backed loan programme.

“We need to convene an urgent meeting at noon to discuss the favoured bounce back loans,” the email read, according to a banking source. It was the first direct communication with banks regarding the loans programme since Saturday’s national lockdown announcement.

While the chancellor had committed to crafting a new government-backed loans programme for 2021, the reality of a second lockdown put more businesses under pressure without additional emergency funding.

Kevin Hollinrake, a Conservative MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on fair business banking, welcomed the Treasury’s announcement but said firms would benefit form a longer extension into the middle of 2021.

He said the top-ups should also apply to the larger CBILS scheme, which allows firms to borrow up to £5m and comes with an 80% government guarantee.

Hollinrake said the Treasury had also failed to address the fact that non-bank lenders are blocked from accessing cheap funding from the Bank of England. It means they cannot afford to offer bounce back loans – which come with a flat 2.5% interest rate – to their customers. Meanwhile, most lenders that do have access to cheap Bank of England funds are not processing applications from non-customers.

“That’s still a work in progress and an issue that needs to be resolved as soon as possible,” Hollinrake said.

The APPG estimates that about 250,000 businesses are in effect blocked from emergency loans as a result.",11/2/20 0:00,
Scotland urged not to restrict Covid isolation grant by immigration status,"Scotland’s biggest black and minority ethnic network is calling on the Scottish government to “show it can do things differently” by extending its £500 self-isolation support grant to all those with no recourse to public funds (NRPF) because of their immigration status.

People on low incomes in Scotland are now eligible to receive a £500 grant if told to self-isolate, which is administered by local authorities. Applications opened on 12 October.

The Ethnic Minority National Resilience Network (EMNRN) said it would be “unconscionable” to restrict provision after it was told the new grant would only be available to people with NRPF who are working, the Guardian has learned.

Describing NRPF as “the flagship policy of the hostile environment”, the network says in a letter to the Scottish equalities minister, Christina McKelvie, that this approach would disproportionately impact some of Scotland’s most vulnerable black and Asian people, as those subject to NRPF who are allowed to work are predominantly white eastern European and European Economic Area citizens.

The EMNRN, a network of grassroots organisations, campaigners and professionals, set up to support minority communities through the pandemic, has been pushing the Scottish government to use its devolved powers to mitigate the policy, which has left many facing destitution.

Quick guide Scotland's 5-level system to contain Covid explained Show Hide Level 0 Coming into force on 2 November: Light controls on socialising with time limits possible on licensed premises; a maximum of eight people from three households meeting indoors, and 15 people from five households outdoors. Indoor worship, weddings and funerals capped at 50 people; car-sharing should be avoided and face coverings compulsory on public transport. Level 1 As above but only six people from two households can meet indoors or outdoors; numbers at weddings and funerals capped at 20 and no indoor contact sports for over-18s; working in offices restricted to essential only. Level 2 As above, but no indoor socialising and only six people from two households outdoors; enhanced protective measures for schools; outdoor events banned, stadiums closed to spectators but drive-in events and cinemas allowed; no sale of alcohol indoors, except served with meals; soft play, snooker halls, nightclubs and casinos closed. Level 3 No indoor socialising; six people from two households allowed to meet outdoors; no non-essential travel; no indoor or outdoor alcohol sales; hotels, B&Bs and camp sites restricted to locals or essential workers only; all stadiums and events shut; colleges and universities would have greater restrictions on mixing; amateur outdoor contact sports banned; all leisure venues closed; essential public services only. Level 4 As in level 3 but hotels and B&Bs closed except for essential workers; may enforce “stay at home” rules or limit travel distances; only essential journeys on public transport; all non-essential shops are closed; hairdressers, beauticians and driving lessons banned; worship capped at 20 people; only five people allowed at weddings; gyms closed; all leisure venues, pubs, restaurants, visitor attractions and cinemas closed; only essential indoor workplaces, outdoor building and manufacturing allowed. Severin Carrell, Scotland editor

Jenni Keenan, of Perth and Kinross Minority Communities Hub, worked with EU nationals self-isolating during the 2 Sisters chicken factory outbreak in Coupar Angus, who became NRPF by default when they were unable to apply for necessary documents during lockdown.

Keenan said: “We’ve seen many more individuals struggling during the pandemic, and higher numbers of ethnic minorities are in insecure work. We talk about this in abstract terms, but really it’s about a family who can’t feed themselves.

“We know that the Scottish government can’t change immigration law, but it is really important that they take the action they can to mitigate it. The Scottish government have been vocal about the moral argument against NRPF, but as far as we understand it, they could tomorrow introduce a new payment to support those people.”

The EMNRN coordinator, Danny Boyle, said that the extension of the self-isolation grant should set a precedent: “If we have established that a discretionary payment can be progressed under section 4 of the Public Health (Scotland) Act 2008 then the next logical step is to utilise this method to support everyone subjected to the flagship policy of the hostile environment.

“If we are truly committed to a human rights-based approach in Scotland, then now is the time to show that we can do things differently. The progression of longer-term payment would provide clarity, safety and security to people in extremely difficult positions.”

A Scottish government spokesperson said: “On countless occasions we have asked the UK government to lift the restrictions of no recourse to public funds for the duration of the Coronavirus pandemic on public health grounds. As we have seen both before and during the pandemic, we are left in a position where the task of supporting people with NRPF has been shifted to the Scottish Government and local authorities, using the limited powers we have to protect individuals and public health.”

“The Scottish Government is providing funding to third sector organisations supporting people with NRPF in Glasgow and Edinburgh. We have also agreed with local authorities that a discretionary payment, equivalent to the Scottish Welfare Fund, is provided to people with NRPF. Guidance is being provided to help local authorities assess applications.”",11/2/20 0:00,
Reform UK: Brexit party to rebrand as anti-lockdown voice,"Party chairman Richard Tice says country must ‘learn to live with’ Covid not ‘hide in fear’

The Brexit party has applied to the Electoral Commission to change its name to Reform UK in a bid to rebrand the party, which has no elected representatives, as a voice in the anti-lockdown movement.

The party’s leader, Nigel Farage, and chairman, Richard Tice, first announced the plan in a joint article in the Telegraph where they wrote it was “time to redirect our energies”. The name change is subject to approval of the commission.

The Brexit party gained 2% of the vote in the 2019 general election, and none of the 275 candidates it stood won a seat.

Prior to the December election, Farage had announced the party would change its name following the UK’s exit from the European Union and focus on campaigning for changes in the electoral system.

In a statement on Sunday announcing the plans to rebrand the party, Farage said: “As promised, we continue to keep a very close eye on the government’s trade negotiations with the EU, to ensure a proper Brexit. Further reform in many other areas is also vital for our nations’ future.”

Tice added: “The need for major reform in the UK is clearer now than ever. A new approach is essential, so that government works for the people, not for itself.”

He said that a new strategy was needed for tackling the coronavirus so that “we learn to live with it, not hide in fear of it”.

The idea of ending the Covid pandemic through herd immunity was recently denounced as “a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence”, by 80 researchers who wrote a warning letter in a leading medical journal.

The Brexit party announcement comes as England prepares to enter a four-week nationwide lockdown on 5 November, a decision which has angered some Tory MPs, with prominent backbenchers including Sir Graham Brady warning they are likely to vote against the new restrictions.

MPs will vote on the second lockdown on Wednesday as experts warn that the daily death toll could reach as high as 4,000 by Christmas if swift action is not taken.

Announcing the decision on Saturday evening, Boris Johnson said that if nothing is done the country faced a “peak of mortality” worse than that of the first wave in April.",11/2/20 0:00,
Covid: how chilling projections prompted Johnson to lockdown,"Opposition of Sunak melted away during quad meeting and PM sided with Gove and Hancock

Morgues in converted ice rinks, security guards outside overwhelmed hospitals to turn patients away, even municipal mass graves.

When Boris Johnson’s “quad” of senior ministers met on Friday, they were presented with a chilling prognosis of what would happen if they failed to take draconian action.

As they “walked down the path” of what would happen on current scientific projections, as one official put it, the opposition of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who had feared the devastating economic consequences of another lockdown, melted away.

And the prime minister agreed with lockdown advocates Michael Gove and Matt Hancock that the government’s only acceptable course was to reinstate the “stay at home” order of March.

Significant exceptions, including the government’s determination to keep schools open, mean this latest lockdown will be less draconian than in the spring.

Play Video 1:07 Michael Gove says England's Covid-19 lockdown could be extended – video

But just as in March, Johnson and his colleagues will face the accusation that they have put many lives at risk by acting too late.

The prime minister’s extreme discomfort will only be exacerbated by the fact that he was arguing so enthusiastically against a nationwide lockdown less than a fortnight ago – when he reassured the public his intention was not to “lock the whole place down from John o’ Groats to Lands’ End. Turn the lights out, shut up shop”.

Meanwhile, Downing Street expended precious political capital in newly-gained seats across the north-west by fighting a bitter battle with the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, over financial support in tier 3 areas.

That row was in effect rendered irrelevant on Saturday, when Sunak extended the furlough scheme – which pays 80% of wages – across the country for another month.

Meanwhile, a No 10 operation that prides itself on slick communications, replacing leaky special advisers with hand-picked allies and banning gossipy lunches with Westminster hacks, faced the humiliation of seeing its plans emerge publicly – first late on Friday night in newspapers including the Times; and then on Saturday, as details were finalised, in a series of tweets from Robert Peston.

Robert Peston (@Peston) These are the measures to be announced by the PM at 5, as I understand it. They will last 2 December. And they are, In effect, a new “Tier 4” that will be imposed for a month initially to the whole of England. 1) All pubs and restaurants to close, though takeaways...

The comprehensive leaks infuriated Conservative MPs and led to an apologetic letter from Johnson to his own party, and Saturday’s hastily convened press conference, which was delayed by more than two and a half hours as the finishing touches were made.

Downing Street insiders joked bleakly on Sunday that they had beaten Strictly Come Dancing in the Saturday night TV ratings, netting 4m more viewers than the family favourite, as the public tuned in to see the depressing details of what November would hold.

Johnson’s allies argue that they couldn’t have won the argument about the need for a nationwide lockdown a month or so ago, when the government’s scientific advisers first recommended it.

“At that point, do you take the public with you?,” said one. “Do you take parliament with you? Do you take the media with you? I think the answers to those questions is probably no, a month ago.”

“There was huge scepticism,” said the aide, suggesting the public may not have abided by a lockdown at that time. “Ultimately, you govern by consensus,” they added.

But many in Johnson’s own party were this weekend raging at what they see as the lack of grip shown by Downing Street – and the government’s failure to provide a clear route out of the crisis.

The prime minister’s backbench critics fall into three groups. A hard core of libertarian Conservative MPs, such as Desmond Swayne, of New Forest West, regard draconian restrictions of the kind announced on Saturday as an authoritarian outrage – an infringement of personal freedom.

UK: number of new coronavirus cases per day UK: number of new coronavirus cases per day

A much wider group have profound worries about the economic and social impact of the new rules, with many citing the concerns of desperate business-owners in their constituencies.

And a third cohort say they will grudgingly support the lockdown in the face of the bleak epidemiological outlook; but are absolutely despairing about the government’s handling of the past few weeks – and the pandemic more broadly.

One said their response to Johnson’s announcement was “not printable in a family newspaper”.

Another that they could only support the new restrictions if the government pledges to fix the struggling test-and-trace system.

Many fear the Tories’ reputation for hard-headed competence, already threatened by three years of Brexit chaos, has been obliterated by Johnson’s zig-zag approach to tackling the virus, from “stay at home,” to “eat out to help out” and back again.

Labour’s support will ensure the new lockdown rules pass when they are voted on in the House of Commons on Wednesday, even if there is a significant rebellion on the government side.

But Keir Starmer called for a “circuit breaker” lockdown three weeks ago, and he and his front bench will also continue to hammer home the message that Johnson’s “dithering” has cost lives and livelihoods – a message it may become increasingly hard to bat away by dismissing him jokily as “captain hindsight”.",11/1/20 0:00,
How bad will the second lockdown in England be for UK plc?,"Economists predict another big hit but the GDP drop will not be so severe, not least because it has less far to fall

It goes without saying that the lockdown restrictions due to come into force in England represent a serious setback for the economy. This, after all, is deja vu time, and back in the spring during lockdown 1 activity collapsed. Between February and April gross domestic product fell by a quarter.

So when a Whitehall insider says “it’s going to be bad” in response to a question about the likely impact of the lockdown, that’s a statement of the blindingly obvious. What’s at issue is just how bad.

The answer is that even a four-week shutdown will take a sizeable chunk out of GDP because the sectors that will be hardest hit – retail, hospitality, travel, tourism – make up such a big chunk of the economy, around 15% of all activity.

Second England lockdown fuels fears of Covid double-dip recession Read more

For retail and hospitality the lockdown could hardly have come at a worse time because both sectors usually see takings rise markedly in November and December. For many businesses a good end to the year is the difference between making a profit or loss, and there is a risk that bars and restaurants that just about clung on through the first lockdown will throw in the towel this time.

In part, that’s because there is no certainty about how long the closures will go on for. As Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, put it: “I can’t say I am terribly confident we will be out of this by 2 December”.

The IFS – a thinktank that specialises in the public finances – had yet to do serious number crunching on what the lockdown would do to the government’s budget deficit, but was forecasting a shortfall of £350bn even before the new restrictions were announced. Johnson’s best guess is that the lockdown will add £20bn to the total.

“There will be a loss of tax revenues and at least one month of full furlough. There were 2-3 million people on furlough in September and the figure in November is likely to be double that.”

Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was unlikely to take as severe a hit as that suffered in April, when it shrank by 20%.

“Not everything is going to be closed this time,” Dales said. “People are more used to working from home and the schools are going to stay open. Shutting schools took a lot off GDP both directly and indirectly because parents had to take time off work to look after their children.”

Dales said there was one other reason the contraction would be less severe: even after its recovery since May the economy is around 5% smaller than it was before the crisis. “It has less far to fall”, he said.",11/1/20 0:00,
"Adolescent with COVID-19 as the Source of an Outbreak at a 3-Week Family Gathering — Four States, June–July 2020","On October 5, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

There is increasing evidence that children and adolescents can efficiently transmit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1–3). During July–August 2020, four state health departments and CDC investigated a COVID-19 outbreak that occurred during a 3-week family gathering of five households in which an adolescent aged 13 years was the index and suspected primary patient; 11 subsequent cases occurred.

Both heads of each household were interviewed to assess demographic characteristics, exposures, symptoms, close contacts, and outcomes. Parents provided data for all children, adolescents, and young adults. Thirteen of the index patient’s relatives sought viral testing; test results were reported by respondents, and all test results that were reported to be positive were verified in state reporting systems. For three children and adolescents who were not tested while symptomatic, a chemiluminescent immunoassay* detecting total antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was performed 28–46 days after symptom onset; results were positive for all three children and adolescents, including the index patient and her two brothers, indicating earlier infection. Likely exposure periods† and infectious periods§ were estimated from symptom onset dates. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶

While away from home, the index patient was exposed during a large COVID-19 outbreak in June 2020. Because of her exposure, she sought testing for SARS-CoV-2 after returning home. A rapid antigen test performed 4 days after exposure, when she was asymptomatic, was negative (Table) (Figure). She experienced nasal congestion 2 days later, her only symptom. That same day, she, her parents, and two brothers traveled to a gathering with 15 other relatives, which began the following day. Attendees belonged to five households in four states and ranged in age from 9 to 72 years. Fourteen relatives, including the index patient, stayed in a five-bedroom, two-bathroom house for 8–25 days. These relatives did not wear face masks or practice physical distancing. An additional six relatives (an aunt, an uncle, and four cousins) visited for 10 hours on day 3 and 3 hours on day 10, when six overnight attendees were potentially infectious, but maintained physical distance and remained outdoors; none wore face masks.

Among the 14 persons who stayed in the same house, 12 experienced symptoms** and were subsequently found to have COVID-19 based on Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists definitions.†† Six cases were confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, four persons were classified as having probable COVID-19 based on positive antigen testing or clinical and epidemiologic criteria, and two persons were classified as having suspected COVID-19 based on positive antibody testing, including the index patient (Table). The other two overnight attendees never experienced symptoms, including one who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result 4 days after the last exposure. One person with COVID-19 was hospitalized and another sought emergency department care for respiratory symptoms; both recovered. None of the six relatives who remained outdoors and maintained physical distance developed symptoms; four had negative RT-PCR test results 4 days after the last exposure, and two were not tested. Relatives with COVID-19 were advised by state investigators to self-isolate, and contacts were advised to self-quarantine.

Eight relatives reported activities outside the gathering during their exposure periods that might have increased their risks for exposure. However, only the index patient reported exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19 or compatible symptoms outside the family. The index patient’s high-risk exposure and symptom onset 3–19 days before that of any other person at the family gathering support the hypothesis that this adolescent’s infection was the source of the family outbreak (Figure). The adolescent’s initial antigen test result was likely a false negative because it was performed before symptom onset; the only antigen test that had Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization at the time was intended for use within the first 5 days of symptoms.§§

This outbreak highlights several important issues. First, children and adolescents can serve as the source for COVID-19 outbreaks within families, even when their symptoms are mild (2). Better understanding of transmission by children and adolescents in different settings is needed to refine public health guidance. Second, this investigation provides evidence of the benefit of physical distancing as a mitigation strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. None of the six family members who maintained outdoor physical distance without face masks during two visits to the family gathering developed symptoms; the four who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 had negative test results. Third, rapid antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity (84.0%–97.6%) compared with RT-PCR testing; negative results should be confirmed with RT-PCR if used for persons with high pretest probability of infection, such as those with a known exposure (4). Fourth, regardless of negative test results, persons should self-quarantine for 14 days after a known exposure (5) or after travel when mandated by state, territorial, tribal, or local authorities (6). Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can spread efficiently during gatherings, especially with prolonged, close contact. Physical distancing, face mask use, and hand hygiene reduce transmission; gatherings should be avoided when physical distancing and face mask use are not possible (7).",10/8/20 0:00,
"Recent Increase in COVID-19 Cases Reported Among Adults Aged 18–22 Years — United States, May 31–September 5, 2020","On September 29, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

Although children and young adults are reportedly at lower risk for severe disease and death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), than are persons in other age groups (1), younger persons can experience infection and subsequently transmit infection to those at higher risk for severe illness (2–4). Although at lower risk for severe disease, some young adults experience serious illness, and asymptomatic or mild cases can result in sequelae such as myocardial inflammation (5). In the United States, approximately 45% of persons aged 18–22 years were enrolled in colleges and universities in 2019 (6). As these institutions reopen, opportunities for infection increase; therefore, mitigation efforts and monitoring reports of COVID-19 cases among young adults are important. During August 2–September 5, weekly incidence of COVID-19 among persons aged 18–22 years rose by 55.1% nationally; across U.S. Census regions,* increases were greatest in the Northeast, where incidence increased 144.0%, and Midwest, where incidence increased 123.4%. During the same period, changes in testing volume for SARS-CoV-2 in this age group ranged from a 6.2% decline in the West to a 170.6% increase in the Northeast. In addition, the proportion of cases in this age group among non-Hispanic White (White) persons increased from 33.8% to 77.3% during May 31–September 5. Mitigation and preventive measures targeted to young adults can likely reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission among their contacts and communities. As colleges and universities resume operations, taking steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among young adults is critical (7).

CDC receives patient-level COVID-19 data from jurisdictional health departments through a standardized CDC COVID-19 case report form.† Data on probable and confirmed cases from 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and four territories (Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) were analyzed to determine national trends among demographic groups during May 31–September 5, 2020.§ When available, date of symptom onset was used in calculations of weekly trends of case data; if symptom onset date was unavailable, an alternative date was used in the following descending order: specimen collection date, date reported to CDC, or episode date (California only).¶ Trends were analyzed nationally and by U.S. Census region.

Measures of weekly SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing volumes by age were obtained from COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting data submitted by state health departments (37 states) and from data submitted directly by public health, commercial, and reference laboratories (13 states and DC)** when age was unavailable in state-submitted data. Testing data from U.S. territories were not included. Total number of tests was calculated as the sum of negative and positive test results. Testing volume represents individual tests, not the number of persons tested. Date of specimen collection or test order date was used in calculations of weekly trends in testing volume.††

Data on COVID-19 cases and RT-PCR tests were aggregated by calendar week. Subgroup analyses of case reports and tests were analyzed using two measures: 1) number of reported cases (or tests) per 100,000 population per week (termed incidence for cases), which accounts for differences in underlying population size but is affected by reporting lags and underreporting; and 2) percentage of all cases (or all tests) each week, which does not account for differences in population size but is less affected by reporting lags or underreporting (assuming that reported data do not differ in important ways from lagged data).§§ All analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.0.2; The R Foundation).

During August 2–September 5, 2020, a total 999,579 persons with COVID-19 with case report data were reported to CDC, 15.6% of whom were aged 18–22 years. National weekly COVID-19 incidence among persons aged 18–22 years increased 62.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 60.0%–65.3%) during the 4-week period August 2–August 29 from 110 to 180 cases per 100,000 before declining to 171 during August 30–September 5 (Figure 1). During August 2–September 5, weekly incidence increased most in the Northeast (144.0%; 95% CI = 131.5%–157.3%) from 53 to 130 per 100,000, and in the Midwest (123.4%; 95% CI = 116.1%–131.0%), from 111 to 247 (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/94198). Notably, in the Northeast, weekly incidence has remained below 53 cases per 100,000 in all other age groups since July 4. In the South, weekly incidence among persons aged 18–22 years increased 43.8% (95% CI = 40.0%–47.6%) from 115 to 166 cases per 100,000. Weekly increases were smallest in the West, where incidence declined initially until August 22 and then increased through September 5, but, overall, declined 1.7% during August. During August 2–September 5, the proportion of all cases per week that occurred among persons aged 18–22 years approximately doubled (2.1-fold; 95% CI = 2.1–2.2), from 10.5% to 22.5%.

The number of weekly tests performed among persons aged 18–22 years increased 49.3% (95% CI = 48.7%–49.9%) from 1,877 tests per 100,000 during the week of August 2–August 8 to 2,802 during the week of August 30–September 5 (Figure 2). The largest increase in testing relative to population size was in the Northeast, where weekly tests increased 170.6% (95% CI = 168.3%–172.9%) from 1,975 per 100,000 to 5,345, and in the Midwest, where weekly tests increased 65.2% (95% CI = 63.9%–66.5%) from 2,264 per 100,000 to 3,740 (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/94197). In contrast, more modest increases were observed in the South (7.0% [95% CI = 6.3%–7.7%], from 2,041 to 2,183 per 100,000); and in the West, testing volume declined 6.2% (95% CI = 5.1%–7.2%), from 1,191 per 100,000 to 1,118. At the end of this period, the proportion of all tests performed nationally among persons aged 18–22 years had increased from 9.4% to 14.4% (1.5-fold [95% CI = 1.53–1.54] higher than at the beginning).

When examined by race and ethnicity nationally, during August 2–September 5, the weekly incidence among White persons aged 18-22 years increased 149.7% (95% CI = 78.8%–248.7%), from 48 per 100,000 to 120 (Figure 3). During May 31–June 20, the proportion of weekly cases that occurred among White persons aged 18–22 years increased from 33.8%% to 50.8%. Then, during August 2–September 5, the proportion was 1.5-fold that during May 31–June 20 (95% CI = 0.2–12.9), having increased from 52.1% to 77.3%. At the same time, incidence among persons of other racial and ethnic minority groups remained stable or declined. The largest increases in incidence among White persons were in the Midwest (198.2%; from 65 to 195 per 100,000) and the Northeast (168.4%; from 14 to 37 per 100,000) (Supplementary Figure 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/94196).",10/1/20 0:00,
"Multiple COVID-19 Clusters on a University Campus — North Carolina, August 2020","On September 29, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

Preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in institutes of higher education presents a unique set of challenges because of the presence of congregate living settings and difficulty limiting socialization and group gatherings. Before August 2020, minimal data were available regarding COVID-19 outbreaks in these settings. On August 3, 2020, university A in North Carolina broadly opened campus for the first time since transitioning to primarily remote learning in March. Consistent with CDC guidance at that time (1,2), steps were taken to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on campus. During August 3–25, 670 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified; 96% were among patients aged <22 years. Eighteen clusters of five or more epidemiologically linked cases within 14 days of one another were reported; 30% of cases were linked to a cluster. Student gatherings and congregate living settings, both on and off campus, likely contributed to the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the university community. On August 19, all university A classes transitioned to online, and additional mitigation efforts were implemented. At this point, 334 university A–associated COVID-19 cases had been reported to the local health department. The rapid increase in cases within 2 weeks of opening campus suggests that robust measures are needed to reduce transmission at institutes of higher education, including efforts to increase consistent use of masks, reduce the density of on-campus housing, increase testing for SARS-CoV-2, and discourage student gatherings.

University A students returned to residence halls during August 3–9, 2020, and in-person classes began on August 10. Mitigation steps taken to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on campus included scheduling move-in appointments across a 1-week period, decreasing classroom density to facilitate physical distancing, and reducing maximum dining hall capacity and increasing takeout options. Students were required to sign an acknowledgment of community standards and university guidelines recommending daily symptom checks, use of masks in all indoor common spaces and classrooms, physical distancing of ≥6 feet in indoor and outdoor settings, and limitations on group gatherings consistent with local guidelines (groups of no more than 10 persons indoors and 25 outdoors). Approximately 95% of students signed the acknowledgment; however, data on adherence to these important mitigation strategies were not available. Reentry testing for COVID-19 and quarantine before or after arrival on campus were not used (1). Except for two dormitories reserved for isolation and quarantine, residence halls opened at 60%–85% capacity, with most students in double rooms. Those at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, according to CDC guidance (3), had the option to request a single room. Undergraduate enrollment in university A for the fall semester was 19,690 students. Approximately 5,800 (29%) of these undergraduate students resided on campus as of August 10. In 2019, 83% of undergraduate students were North Carolina residents.

By August 25, 670 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a specimen collection date for SARS-CoV-2 testing of August 3 or later had been identified among students, faculty, and staff members at university A (Figure). Cases were identified by the student health clinic (by self-report or through testing at the student health clinic or the university hospital testing center) or linked to a university cluster by the local health department. Initial information was collected by the university at the time of testing; the university also implemented contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine. Additional investigation of cases was conducted by the local health department for students who were tested off campus. Cases were classified according to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists COVID-19 2020 Interim Case Definition (4). An additional 120 potential cases identified by the student health clinic had insufficient information to meet criteria for confirmed or probable COVID-19 and were not included in the analysis. Information on cases reported only to the university employee occupational health clinic, which is separate from the student health clinic, was not available for review at the time of analysis.

Among 670 confirmed cases with specimen collection dates during August 3–25 for SARS-CoV-2 testing, median patient age was 19 years (range = 17–50 years), and 293 (47%) cases occurred in males (information on gender was missing for 47 [7%] patients). Information on school affiliation (e.g., undergraduate versus graduate/professional student, faculty, or staff member) was not consistently recorded; however, considering patient age <22 years as an indicator of undergraduate status, 643 (96%) cases were estimated to have occurred in undergraduate students; among these students, 230 (36%) resided on campus, and at least 51 (8%) were members of a fraternity or sorority and 51 (8%) were student athletes. For the remainder, place of residence, including if living at home or in shared apartments, was not readily available. As of August 25, no COVID-19 patients were hospitalized or had died, and no cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or adults were reported. One student was kept for extended observation in a hospital emergency department. Information on other clinical manifestations, such as myocarditis, was not available.

Clusters were defined as the occurrence of five or more epidemiologically linked cases (e.g., common residence, sports team, or fraternal organization membership) within 14 days of one another (by earliest date of illness identification). During August 3–25, 18 clusters at university A were identified, eight in residence halls, five among students with membership in a fraternity or sorority, one in off-campus apartments, and four among athletic teams. Overall, 201 (30%) cases were linked to a cluster. Clusters ranged in size from five to 106 patients (median = five), with the largest cluster associated with a university-affiliated apartment complex.

On August 19, when 334 (50%) university A–associated cases had been reported to the local health department, all university A classes transitioned to online, and efforts to reduce the density of on-campus housing commenced. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was recommended for all persons living in residence halls with case clusters and was offered to all students at the student health clinic and the university hospital testing center. Students living in on-campus residence halls were required to return home unless they applied for and received a hardship waiver indicating they could remain on campus. All students returning home were instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days following departure from campus. Off-campus testing sites were set up both to meet community needs and target off-campus student housing complexes with multiple cases.",10/1/20 0:00,
"COVID-19 Trends Among School-Aged Children — United States, March 1–September 19, 2020","On September 28, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

It is important for schools and communities to monitor multiple indicators of COVID-19 among school-aged children and layer prevention strategies to reduce COVID-19 disease risk for students, teachers, school staff, and families. These results can provide a baseline for monitoring trends and evaluating mitigation strategies.

Since March, 277,285 COVID-19 cases in children have been reported. COVID-19 incidence among adolescents aged 12–17 years was approximately twice that in children aged 5–11 years. Underlying conditions were more common among school-aged children with severe outcomes related to COVID-19. Weekly incidence, SARS-CoV-2 test volume, and percentage of tests positive among school-aged children varied over time and by region of the United States.

Approximately 56 million school-aged children (aged 5–17 years) resumed education in the United States in fall 2020.* Analysis of demographic characteristics, underlying conditions, clinical outcomes, and trends in weekly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence during March 1–September 19, 2020 among 277,285 laboratory-confirmed cases in school-aged children in the United States might inform decisions about in-person learning and the timing and scaling of community mitigation measures. During May–September 2020, average weekly incidence (cases per 100,000 children) among adolescents aged 12–17 years (37.4) was approximately twice that of children aged 5–11 years (19.0). In addition, among school-aged children, COVID-19 indicators peaked during July 2020: weekly percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results increased from 10% on May 31 to 14% on July 5; SARS-CoV-2 test volume increased from 100,081 tests on May 31 to 322,227 on July 12, and COVID-19 incidence increased from 13.8 per 100,000 on May 31 to 37.9 on July 19. During July and August, test volume and incidence decreased then plateaued; incidence decreased further during early September and might be increasing. Percentage of positive test results decreased during August and plateaued during September. Underlying conditions were more common among school-aged children with severe outcomes related to COVID-19: among school-aged children who were hospitalized, admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), or who died, 16%, 27%, and 28%, respectively, had at least one underlying medical condition. Schools and communities can implement multiple, concurrent mitigation strategies and tailor communications to promote mitigation strategies to prevent COVID-19 spread. These results can provide a baseline for monitoring trends and evaluating mitigation strategies.

School-aged children were stratified by age into two groups: children aged 5–11 years and adolescents aged 12–17 years. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified from individual-level case reports submitted by state health departments for the weeks beginning March 1–September 13, 2020.† Confirmed cases had a positive real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 case data for all children were analyzed to examine demographic characteristics, underlying conditions,§ hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. Trends were analyzed using CDC report date¶ to calculate a daily 7-day moving average, aggregated by week. Analyses are descriptive; statistical comparisons were not performed.

To examine trends in laboratory testing volume and percentage of positive test results, data from COVID-19 electronic laboratory data were used. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results were obtained for the weeks beginning May 31–September 13, 2020 from COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting data submitted by state health departments (37 states); when age was unavailable in state-submitted data, information from data submitted directly by public health, commercial, and reference laboratories (13 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia) were used.** Data represent test results, not number of persons tested; specimen collection date or test order date was used for analysis.†† The weekly percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results was calculated nationally for each U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Region§§ as the number of positive test results divided by the sum of positive and negative test results.

During March 1–September 19, 2020, a total of 277,285 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in school-aged children were reported in the United States, including 101,503 (37%) in children aged 5–11 years and 175,782 (63%) in adolescents aged 12–17 years (Table). Overall, 50.8% were in females (aged 5–11 years = 49.4%; aged 12–17 = 51.6%). Among 161,387 (58%) school-aged children with COVID-19 and complete information on race/ethnicity, 42% were Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic), 32% were non-Hispanic White (White), and 17% were non-Hispanic Black (Black). Hispanic children accounted for 46% of cases among younger children and 39% among adolescents; White children accounted for 26% of cases in younger children and 36% in adolescents.¶¶ Weekly incidence among school-aged children increased from March 1, peaking at 37.9 cases per 100,000 the week of July 19 (aged 5–11 years = 25.7; aged 12–17 years = 51.9), plateaued at an average of 34 per 100,000 during July 26–August 23, decreased to 22.6 per 100,000 the week of September 6, and rebounded to 26.3 per 100,000 the last week for which data are available (Figure 1) (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/94150). Trends in incidence were similar among both age groups. Incidence among adolescents was approximately double that among younger children throughout the reporting period. During May–September, average weekly incidence among adolescents was 37.4 cases per 100,000 compared with 19.0 per 100,000 for younger children.

Weekly SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test volume among school-aged children more than tripled, from 100,081 tests performed during the week beginning May 31 to a peak of 322,227 during the week beginning July 12, then decreased to approximately 260,000 during August and rebounded in September; test volume was higher among adolescents than younger children (Figure 2) (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/94150) (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/94151). The percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results increased for both age groups from May 31 and peaked during the week beginning July 5; percentage of positive test results then decreased among both age groups. Since August 23, the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results plateaued at 7% among adolescents and continued to decrease among younger children.

HHS Regions 6, 4, and 9 had the highest weekly percentage of positive test results, peaking during the week of July 5 at 24% (Region 6), 18% (Region 4), and 17% (Region 9), and all declined to approximately 8% the week beginning September 13 (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/94151). In Region 1, weekly percentage of positive tests decreased from 8% during the week beginning May 31 to <2% during the week beginning September 13. In Region 9, the percentage of positive test results was similar over time in both age groups; in Regions 5 and 7, although the percentage of positive test results were initially similar in both age groups, beginning in early June (Region 7) and mid-June (Region 5), the percentage of positive test results in adolescents exceeded that among younger children.

Among school-aged children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 58% reported at least one symptom, 5% reported no symptoms, and information on symptoms was missing or unknown for 37% (Table). Overall, 3,240 (1.2%) school-aged children with COVID-19 were hospitalized, including 404 (0.1%) who required ICU admission. Fifty-one (<0.01%) school-aged children died of COVID-19. Among school-aged children with complete information on race/ethnicity who were hospitalized (2,473 [76%]) or admitted to an ICU (321 [80%]), Hispanic ethnicity was most commonly reported (45% and 43%, respectively), followed by Black (24% and 28%, respectively) and White (22% and 17%, respectively) races.

Among school-aged children with COVID-19, at least one underlying condition was reported for 7,738 (3%), including approximately 3% of adolescents and 2% of younger children. Among those with an underlying condition, chronic lung disease, including asthma, was most commonly reported (55%), followed by disability*** (9%), immunosuppressive conditions (7%), diabetes (6%), psychological conditions (6%), cardiovascular disease (5%), and severe obesity (4%). At least one underlying condition was reported for 16% of school-aged children who were hospitalized for COVID-19, 27% of those admitted to an ICU, and 28% of those who died.",10/1/20 0:00,
"Changing Age Distribution of the COVID-19 Pandemic — United States, May–August 2020","On September 23, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

During June–August 2020, COVID-19 incidence was highest in persons aged 20–29 years, who accounted for >20% of all confirmed cases. Younger adults likely contribute to community transmission of COVID-19. Across the southern United States in June 2020, increases in percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among adults aged 20–39 years preceded increases among those aged ≥60 years by 4–15 days.

As of September 21, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had resulted in more than 6,800,000 reported U.S. cases and more than 199,000 associated deaths.* Early in the pandemic, COVID-19 incidence was highest among older adults (1). CDC examined the changing age distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States during May–August by assessing three indicators: COVID-19–like illness-related emergency department (ED) visits, positive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and confirmed COVID-19 cases. Nationwide, the median age of COVID-19 cases declined from 46 years in May to 37 years in July and 38 in August. Similar patterns were seen for COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results in all U.S. Census regions. During June–August, COVID-19 incidence was highest in persons aged 20–29 years, who accounted for >20% of all confirmed cases. The southern United States experienced regional outbreaks of COVID-19 in June. In these regions, increases in the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among adults aged 20–39 years preceded increases among adults aged ≥60 years by an average of 8.7 days (range = 4–15 days), suggesting that younger adults likely contributed to community transmission of COVID-19. Given the role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (2), strict adherence to community mitigation strategies and personal preventive behaviors by younger adults is needed to help reduce their risk for infection and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons at higher risk for severe illness.

CDC examined age trends during May–August for 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) using three indicators: 1) COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits; 2) positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results; and 3) confirmed COVID-19 cases. COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits, reported by health facilities to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP),† had fever with cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing in the chief complaint text or a discharge diagnostic code for COVID-19 and no diagnostic codes for influenza.§ Analyses of COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits were based on the ED visit date.

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results were obtained from COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting data submitted by state health departments (37 states) and, when age was unavailable in state-submitted data, from data submitted directly by public health, commercial, and reference laboratories (13 states and DC).¶ Data represent the number of specimens tested, not individual persons who received testing. Analyses were based on the specimen collection date or test order date.** The daily percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (percent positivity) was calculated as the number of positive test results divided by the sum of positive and negative test results.

Confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified from individual-level case reports submitted by state health departments††; analyses were based on the date the case was reported to CDC.§§ Confirmed COVID-19 cases had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result. Case data represent individual persons (some of whom might have had multiple positive test results). Monthly incidence was calculated using 2018 U.S. Census population estimates.

National case counts, percentage distributions, and estimated incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases were calculated by 10-year age increments and by month (May–August). The weekly median age of persons with COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits, positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as that of persons for whom all SARS-CoV-2 tests were conducted, were plotted nationally for the four U.S. Census regions. To minimize the impact of testing availability on findings, the early pandemic period (January–April) was excluded.

The southern United States experienced regional COVID-19 outbreaks during June–July 2020. For U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Regions 4, 6, and 9,¶¶ daily percent positivity was plotted for four age groups (0–19 years, 20–39 years, 40–59 years, and ≥60 years). The segmented package (version 1.2-0) in R software (version 3.6.0; The R Foundation) was used to segment the age group-specific trend lines and identify inflection points when the slopes changed.

National incidence of confirmed COVID-19 increased from 185 cases per 100,000 persons in May to 316 in July, then declined to 275 in August (Table). During May–July, incidence increased among persons in all age groups <80 years, with the largest increases in persons aged <30 years. As a result, the median age of confirmed COVID-19 cases decreased from 46 years in May to 37 years in July and 38 years in August. During June–August, incidence was highest among persons aged 20–29 years, who accounted for the largest proportion of total cases (>20%). Similar age shifts were observed nationwide.

The median age trend lines for all three indicators (COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits, positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and confirmed COVID-19 cases) followed similar patterns in the national data (Figure 1) and within each U.S. Census region (Figure 2); however, patterns differed by region. Nationally and in the South and Midwest, median age decreased until mid- to late June, increased during July, and decreased in the latter half of August. In the West, median age declined from May to mid-June and then remained relatively stable or slightly increased during July–August. In the Northeast, median age of persons with positive test results and confirmed cases was stable in May, decreased sharply in June, increased slightly in July, and decreased in August; median age for persons with COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits declined steadily from mid-June to mid-August. In all four U.S. Census regions, the median age of persons for whom all SARS-CoV-2 tests were conducted was relatively stable in May (whereas median age of persons with positive test results and confirmed cases declined in May) and began to decrease following declines in the other three indicators.

During June 2020 in HHS Regions 4, 6, and 9, the change to an upward slope in percent positivity among persons aged 20–39 years occurred an average of 8.7 days (range 4–15 days) before the change to an upward slope among persons aged ≥60 years (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/93914). This pattern was most evident in Region 4 (Southeast) where the increase in percent positivity among persons aged 20–39 years preceded increases among persons aged 40–59 years by 9 days and those aged ≥60 years by 15 days; percent positivity among persons aged 0–19 years increased steadily from early May to early July. Within HHS Regions 6 and 9 (Southcentral and Southwest), the percent positivity among persons aged 0–19, 20–39, and 40–59 years increased at approximately the same time and preceded increases among persons aged ≥60 years by approximately 7 days in Region 6 and 4 days in Region 9.",10/1/20 0:00,
"SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Hospitalized Pregnant Women: Reasons for Admission and Pregnancy Characteristics — Eight U.S. Health Care Centers, March 1–May 30, 2020","On September 16, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

Prevalences of prepregnancy obesity and gestational diabetes were higher among pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19–related illness (e.g., worsening respiratory status) than among those admitted for pregnancy-related treatment or procedures (e.g., delivery) and found to have COVID-19. Intensive care was required for 30% (13 of 43) of pregnant women admitted for COVID-19, and one pregnant woman died from COVID-19.

Pregnant women might be at increased risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), possibly related to changes in their immune system and respiratory physiology* (1). Further, adverse birth outcomes, such as preterm delivery and stillbirth, might be more common among pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (2,3). Information about SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is rapidly growing; however, data on reasons for hospital admission, pregnancy-specific characteristics, and birth outcomes among pregnant women hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infections are limited. During March 1–May 30, 2020, as part of Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)† surveillance of COVID-19 hospitalizations, 105 hospitalized pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified, including 62 (59%) hospitalized for obstetric reasons (i.e., labor and delivery or another pregnancy-related indication) and 43 (41%) hospitalized for COVID-19 illness without an obstetric reason. Overall, 50 (81%) of 62 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted for obstetric reasons were asymptomatic. Among 43 pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19, 13 (30%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, six (14%) required mechanical ventilation, and one died from COVID-19. Prepregnancy obesity was more common (44%) among pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19 than that among asymptomatic pregnant women hospitalized for obstetric reasons (31%). Likewise, the rate of gestational diabetes (26%) among pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19 was higher than it was among women hospitalized for obstetric reasons (8%). Preterm delivery occurred in 15% of pregnancies among 93 women who delivered, and stillbirths (fetal death at ≥20 weeks’ gestation) occurred in 3%. Antenatal counseling emphasizing preventive measures (e.g., use of masks, frequent hand washing, and social distancing) might help prevent COVID-19 among pregnant women,§ especially those with prepregnancy obesity and gestational diabetes, which might reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes.

VSD is a collaboration between CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and nine U.S. health care organizations serving more than 12 million persons each year. Hospitalizations with a patient diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified using COVID-19 International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, (ICD-10-CM)¶ and site-specific internal diagnosis codes during March 1–May 30, 2020. Pregnant women were identified using a validated algorithm based on ICD-9 diagnosis and procedure codes (4) that has been modified for ICD-10. For this study, medical records of women hospitalized with COVID-19 were reviewed by abstractors and adjudicated by a physician to identify the primary reason for hospital admission, pregnancy characteristics, COVID-19 complications, and birth outcomes among women who delivered before July 31, 2020.

Pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnoses were classified into the following three groups based on the primary reason for admission: 1) treatment of COVID-19 without an obstetric reason (e.g., worsening respiratory distress); 2) an obstetric reason, along with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath); and 3) an obstetric reason, without COVID-19–compatible symptoms (or with a history of resolved COVID-19), but with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of admission. Demographic and pregnancy characteristics among pregnant women admitted for COVID-19 were compared with those of women admitted for obstetric reasons. Birth outcomes in pregnant women with SARS-COV-2 infection were compared with background rates among all pregnant women in eight VSD sites during the study period. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.** SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used to conduct all analyses.

During March 1–May 30, among 4,408 persons hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis at VSD sites, 105 (2.4%) pregnant women were identified. SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction test results were positive for 104 women. One additional woman, who had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result, was symptomatic and had close contacts with confirmed COVID-19; she received a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Among these 105 pregnant women, 43 (41.0%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 illness and 62 (59.0%) were admitted for obstetric reasons (Table 1). Among the 62 women admitted for obstetric reasons, 12 (19.4%) had COVID-19–compatible symptoms, and 50 (80.6%) were asymptomatic. The median age of all women was 30 years (range = 17–54 years), and 61.9% were Hispanic or Latino (Table 2). ICU admission was required for 14 (13.3%) hospitalized pregnant women, including 13 (30.2%) of the 43 women hospitalized for COVID-19; six of these women required mechanical ventilation, and one, admitted at 15 weeks’ gestation, died from COVID-19. The prevalence of prepregnancy obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) was 36.2% overall and was higher among the 43 women hospitalized for COVID-19 (44.2%) than among the 62 hospitalized for obstetric reasons (30.6%). Similarly, prevalence of gestational diabetes was higher among women hospitalized for COVID-19 (25.6%) than among those hospitalized for obstetric reasons (8.1%).

Among all 105 pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, 93 (88.6%) had a pregnancy outcome before July 31 (Table 3), including 79 (84.9%) who delivered during their initial hospitalization and 14 (15.1%) during a subsequent hospitalization. One of the remaining 12 women died during initial hospitalization, and 11 were still pregnant at the time of analysis. Preterm delivery prevalence was 15.1% overall and 12.2% among live births, which is nearly 70% higher than baseline rates in VSD during the study period (8.9% among 43,571 live births and stillbirths in VSD). Stillbirth prevalence (3.2%) was more than four times higher among women with SARS-CoV-2 than the baseline rate in VSD during the study period (0.6%). All three stillbirths were antepartum: one with placental abruption and two with no identified etiology based on adjudication.",9/24/20 0:00,
"COVID-19 Contact Tracing in Two Counties — North Carolina, June–July 2020","On September 22, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

Contact tracing is a strategy implemented to minimize the spread of communicable diseases (1,2). Prompt contact tracing, testing, and self-quarantine can reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (3,4). Community engagement is important to encourage participation in and cooperation with SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing (5). Substantial investments have been made to scale up contact tracing for COVID-19 in the United States. During June 1–July 12, 2020, the incidence of COVID-19 cases in North Carolina increased 183%, from seven to 19 per 100,000 persons per day* (6). To assess local COVID-19 contact tracing implementation, data from two counties in North Carolina were analyzed during a period of high incidence. Health department staff members investigated 5,514 (77%) persons with COVID-19 in Mecklenburg County and 584 (99%) in Randolph Counties. No contacts were reported for 48% of cases in Mecklenburg and for 35% in Randolph. Among contacts provided, 25% in Mecklenburg and 48% in Randolph could not be reached by telephone and were classified as nonresponsive after at least one attempt on 3 consecutive days of failed attempts. The median interval from specimen collection from the index patient to notification of identified contacts was 6 days in both counties. Despite aggressive efforts by health department staff members to perform case investigations and contact tracing, many persons with COVID-19 did not report contacts, and many contacts were not reached. These findings indicate that improved timeliness of contact tracing, community engagement, and increased use of community-wide mitigation are needed to interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Routinely collected case investigation and contact tracing data from June 1–30, 2020, for Mecklenburg, and from June 15–July 12, 2020, for Randolph counties were analyzed. Case investigations were conducted for persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including the elicitation of persons potentially exposed to the index patient (3). Contact tracing was performed for persons identified as close contacts and included inquiry about COVID-19–compatible symptoms† and instructions to self-quarantine for 14 days since last exposure (3). Health department staff members monitored contacts for new-onset symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was encouraged for all close contacts (3). Persons with COVID-19 and contacts were classified as lost to follow-up if they did not respond after three failed attempts to contact them at different times on consecutive days or if contact information was missing or invalid. COVID-19 case-based surveillance data are maintained within the North Carolina Electronic Disease Surveillance System; contact-based information is maintained within the state-supported COVID-19 Community Team Outreach tool. Mecklenburg County uses a commercial information management system, HealthSpace Data Systems Ltd., for case management. This activity was determined to be public health surveillance as defined in 45 CFR 46.102(l).§

Mecklenburg County has an estimated population of 1,110,356 persons (6) most of whom live in the city of Charlotte. In June, Mecklenburg County conducted 61,979 SARS-CoV-2 tests resulting in 8,097 (13%) positive results. Among these, 7,116 (88%) were confirmed as new COVID-19 cases in county residents (Table); the remaining were in residents of other jurisdictions or retests. During the assessment period, an average of 24 cases per 100,000 persons occurred per day. The median interval from specimen collection to reported results was 2 days (range = 0–29 days); 23% (1,602 of 7,116) of laboratory-confirmed cases were lost to follow-up. Overall, 5,514 (77%) persons with positive test results were reached for case investigation and elicitation of contacts; the median interval from specimen collection to case investigation was 4 days (range = 0–38 days). Among COVID-19 patients interviewed, 2,624 (48%) reported no contacts. Among those who did report contacts, 13,401 contacts were named (average contacts per case = 4.6). The median interval from case investigation to contact notification was 1 day (range = 0–25 days). Among reported contacts, 3,331 (25%) were lost to follow-up. An additional 255 (2%) contacts were reached and counseled to quarantine but declined monitoring by the health department. Therefore, 9,815 (73%) reported contacts were reached, assessed for current symptoms, counseled to quarantine, and monitored daily by the health department. The median interval between specimen collection and contact notification was 6 days (range = 1–38 days). The total number of contacts tested was not available because contact status was not a required variable on the laboratory requisition form; however, during follow-up, 137 contacts had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

Randolph County has an estimated population of 143,667 (6). During June 15–July 12, Randolph County conducted 6,292 SARS-CoV-2 tests, resulting in 707 positive results. Among these, 589 (83%) were confirmed as new COVID-19 cases among county residents (Table). During the assessment period, an average of 15 cases per 100,000 persons occurred per day. The median interval from specimen collection to reported results was 3 days (range = 0–15 days). Among persons with reported cases, 584 (99%) were reached for case investigation and elicitation of contacts; five (1%) were lost to follow-up, even after dispatching law enforcement to the residential address provided. The median interval from specimen collection date to case investigation date was 3 days (range = 0–36 days). Among COVID-19 patients interviewed, 202 (35%) reported no contacts. Among those who did report contacts, 1,146 were named (average = three contacts per case). An increasing trend in the percentage of cases not reporting contacts was observed, from 26% during week 1 (June 1–7) to 48% during week 4 (June 22–28) of the assessment. The median interval from case investigation to contact notification was 3 days (range = 0–26 days). Among 1,146 reported contacts, 544 (47%) were lost to follow-up. An additional 50 (4%) contacts were reached and counseled to quarantine but declined monitoring by the health department. Thus, 552 (48%) reported contacts were reached, assessed for current symptoms, counseled to quarantine, and monitored daily. The median duration between specimen collection and contact notification was 6 days (range = 0–58 days). A total of 293 (53%) contacts who started quarantine received a SARS-CoV-2 test during follow-up; 69 (24%) results were positive.",9/24/20 0:00,

Summary What is already known about this topic? Facility-wide, serial testing in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) can identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among health care personnel (HCP) and residents to inform mitigation efforts. What is added by this report? Serial facility-wide testing at two Minnesota SNFs identified COVID-19 cases among 64% of residents and 33% of HCP. Genetic sequencing found facility-specific clustering of viral genomes from HCP and residents’ specimens, suggesting intrafacility transmission. What are the implications for public health practice? HCP working in SNFs are at risk for infection during COVID-19 outbreaks. To protect residents and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCP, SNFs need enhanced infection prevention and control practices, assured availability of personal protective equipment, improved HCP testing participation, flexible medical leave, and timely result reporting.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can spread rapidly in high-risk congregate settings such as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) (1). In Minnesota, SNF-associated cases accounted for 3,950 (8%) of 48,711 COVID-19 cases reported through July 21, 2020; 35% of SNF-associated cases involved health care personnel (HCP*), including six deaths. Facility-wide, serial testing in SNFs has been used to identify residents with asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform mitigation efforts, including cohorting of residents with positive test results and exclusion of infected HCP from the workplace (2,3). During April–June 2020, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), with CDC assistance, conducted weekly serial testing at two SNFs experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks. Among 259 tested residents, and 341 tested HCP, 64% and 33%, respectively, had positive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 test results. Continued SARS-CoV-2 transmission was potentially facilitated by lapses in infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, up to 12-day delays in receiving HCP test results (53%) at one facility, and incomplete HCP participation (71%). Genetic sequencing demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from HCP and resident specimens were clustered by facility, suggesting facility-based transmission. Residents and HCP working in SNFs are at risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2. As part of comprehensive COVID-19 preparation and response, including early identification of cases, SNFs should conduct serial testing of residents and HCP, maximize HCP testing participation, ensure availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), and enhance IPC practices† (4–5). Interim guidance for HCP mask use and SNF visitor restriction was implemented statewide by March 31, 2020; however, during April, an increase in COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths among SNF residents in Minnesota occurred. In light of the release of CDC interim guidance on May 1 (6), and in an effort to improve IPC and implement facility-wide SARS-CoV-2 testing, two SNFs located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area contacted MDH after identifying multiple confirmed resident and HCP COVID-19 cases. During April 30–June 12, nasal, nasopharyngeal, or oral swabs were collected from residents and HCP and were tested to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by RT-PCR, which was conducted at MDH Public Health Laboratory (MDH-PHL) and multiple commercial laboratories (6). After a first round of testing on April 30 and May 7 in facilities A and B, respectively, serial testing was conducted in residents every 7–10 days. HCP were offered testing services at the facility during serial testing of residents as well as whenever it was convenient to account for work schedules. Residents and HCP with positive test results were excluded from future serial testing. Starting in mid-March, HCP were screened daily for COVID-19–compatible symptoms, and symptomatic HCP were sent home per MDH and CDC guidance.§ Symptomatic residents and HCP were tested outside of scheduled serial testing. Data on symptoms, demographic characteristics, and HCP work assignment were collected from resident charts, MDH COVID-19 case interviews, and SNF administrator interviews. MDH and CDC provided frequent onsite IPC assessment to both facilities, including review of cohorting, hand hygiene practices, and use of PPE. Residents with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were moved to a COVID-19 care unit within each facility, and HCP with positive test results were excluded from work for at least 10 days (7). Whole genome sequencing was conducted by MDH-PHL on available¶ specimens using previously described methods (8). Phylogenetic relationships, including distinct clustering of viral whole genome sequences, were inferred based on nucleotide differences via IQ-TREE, using general time reversible substitution models (9) as a part of the Nextstrain workflow (10). Descriptive analyses were conducted using R (version 3.6.1; The R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.**

Facility A As of April 14, the census at facility A included 78 residents, with 156 HCP. Before serial testing (April 17–29), COVID-19 was laboratory-confirmed in 14 (18%) symptomatic residents. Facility A conducted three rounds of testing during April 30–May 18. During the first round of serial testing, 23 (43%) of 53 tested residents had positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results (Figure 1); 11 refused testing. Between the first and second rounds of testing, supplementary†† testing of residents at risk, including nine persons who refused the first round of testing, identified 12 confirmed cases among 18 persons tested. During the second and third rounds, 4% (one of 24) and 5% (one of 21) of residents, respectively, tested positive; ongoing clinical monitoring and testing of symptomatic residents did not detect additional cases. Overall, 51 (66%) of 77§§ residents tested had positive test results; 14 (27%) were hospitalized and 12 (24%) died. During April 15–29, 15 (10%) symptomatic HCP at facility A received diagnoses of confirmed COVID-19 by their health care providers (Figure 1). Among those 15 HCP, 14 (93%) worked on the third floor, where 12 of 14 residents with positive test results resided. During the first round of resident testing (April 30), specimens were collected from 43 HCP, eight (20%) of whom received a positive test result. During April 15–June 11, among 156 HCP, 108 (69%) were tested, 38 (35%) of whom had positive test results. Twenty-three (21%) HCP were tested more than once; among these, five (22%) had a positive test result after an initial negative test.

Facility B On April 29, the census at facility B included 183 residents with 324 HCP. Before serial testing (April 29–May 6), 24 (13%) residents had had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results after symptom onset or being tested as a roommate contact (Figure 1). Facility B conducted six rounds of testing during May 7–June 11. During the first, second, third, and fourth rounds, 24% (36 of 153), 25% (26 of 106), 16% (12 of 75), and 10% (six of 59) of residents, respectively, had positive test results. No new cases were identified among the 50 facility B residents tested in the last two rounds. Overall, among 182 residents tested, 114 (63%) COVID-19 cases were identified; 19 (17%) were hospitalized, and 40 (35%) died. An initial round of onsite HCP testing was offered in facility B during May 1–6; 30 (42%) of 71 HCP tested on site, and one HCP tested by a primary health care provider had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (Figure 1). Among the 31 HCP COVID-19 cases, 18 (58%) HCP worked on the first floor, where 21 (88%) of 24 infected residents were initially identified. During May 1–7, reporting of results was delayed up to 12 days for 124 HCP tested by a commercial laboratory, 44 (35%) of whom had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results; subsequently, a different laboratory was used. Overall, from May 1–June 12, 233 (72%) of 324 HCP were tested, 76 (33%) of whom had positive test results. A total of 124 (53%) results from initial HCP tests were delayed up to 12 days. Forty-nine (21%) HCP were tested more than once, including nine (18%) who had a positive test after initially testing negative.

Characteristics of COVID-19 Cases in Health Care Personnel Among 114 total HCP COVID-19 cases diagnosed at facilities A and B, 73 (64%) were in nurses or nursing assistants who provided direct resident care. Additional infections were identified among HCP not involved in direct care, including 13 dietary, six housekeeping, and eight social services staff members (Table). Among the 114 HCP cases, four (4%) were hospitalized, and two (2%) died. Fifty-eight (51%) persons were symptomatic on the day of testing. Among 65 HCP interviewed by MDH, 30 (46%) reported working on or after the date of their symptom onset before receiving positive test results.

Whole Genome Sequencing Specimens from 18 (35%) residents and seven (18%) HCP at facility A were sequenced (Figure 2). Strains from 17 residents and five HCP were genetically similar, including one collected from a dietary worker with limited resident contact. Specimens from two HCP and one resident at facility A had distinctly different virus sequences from the first cluster and from each other. At facility B, 75 (66%) resident specimens and five (7%) HCP specimens were sequenced, all of which were genetically similar. The observed viral diversity of specimens associated within the two facilities was less than that observed in all sequenced specimens sampled from Minnesota cases in the community during the same period, April–June 2020 (data not shown).

Discussion SARS-CoV-2 transmission was decreased by early identification of asymptomatic infections through introduction of facility-wide testing and prompt implementation of mitigation efforts, including cohorting of infected residents and exclusion of infected HCP in two SNFs in Minnesota. Challenges to case identification and outbreak control included delays in reporting of test results, HCP working while symptomatic, and low baseline knowledge of and experience with IPC and PPE use. Low HCP participation in serial testing limited complete identification of infections. Anecdotal reports from HCP included anxiety about receiving positive test results, including financial losses resulting from work exclusion, and concern about workplace and community stigma. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA sequences isolated from HCP and residents were genetically most similar to other strains associated with the same facility, suggesting transmission within the facility. Two HCP from facility A had genetically distinct strains, highlighting the additional risk for community-acquired infections among HCP and the potential for multiple introductions. Sequence similarity among resident and HCP specimens and high rates of HCP infection, including in HCP with limited resident contact, highlight the potential for transmission between HCP or indirect routes of HCP infection from residents. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, symptom status might have been misclassified because case investigation data were incomplete. Second, not all eligible residents participated in each testing round, and some results were indeterminate and required follow-up repeat testing; one participant at each facility refused all testing. Third, limited participation by HCP in serial testing could have biased identification of infections and limited interpretation of genomic sequencing. Finally, whole genome sequencing was conducted on available specimens, and few specimens from the early stages of outbreaks were available, limiting the description of genetic diversity. Serial testing of residents and all HCP, until no new cases are detected after 14 days (4), together with IPC strengthening, are critical strategies necessary to control COVID-19 outbreaks in SNFs. Because residents and HCP can sustain SARS-CoV-2 transmission and HCP present an ongoing risk for introducing SARS-CoV-2-from the community, barriers to HCP testing must be addressed and overcome for test-based approaches to successfully reduce COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality. HCP in SNFs are at high risk for infection, especially in outbreak settings. Testing, IPC education, flexible medical leave and PPE resources must be targeted to this at-risk workforce (4,5).

"Preventing COVID-19 Outbreaks in Long-Term Care Facilities Through Preemptive Testing of Residents and Staff Members — Fulton County, Georgia, March–May 2020","LTCFs in which testing was conducted after a confirmed case of COVID-19 were found to have significantly higher proportions of infected residents and staff members at initial testing and after 4 weeks of follow-up compared with those testing as a preventive measure. The majority of LTCFs testing as a preventive measure identified an infection, although initial prevalence was significantly lower and fewer cases occurred during follow-up.

Long-term care facility (LTCF) residents are at particularly high risk for morbidity and mortality associated with infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), given their age and high prevalence of chronic medical conditions, combined with functional impairment that often requires frequent, close contact with health care providers, who might inadvertently spread the virus to residents (1,2). During March–May 2020 in Fulton County, Georgia, >50% of COVID-19–associated deaths occurred among LTCF residents, although these persons represented <1% of the population (3,4). Mass testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been an effective strategy for identifying asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections in LTCFs (5). This analysis sought to evaluate the timing at which mass testing took place in relation to the known presence of a COVID-19 infection and the resulting number of infections that occurred. In 15 LTCFs that performed facility-wide testing in response to an identified case, high prevalences of additional cases in residents and staff members were found at initial testing (28.0% and 7.4%, respectively), suggesting spread of infection had already occurred by the time the first case was identified. Prevalence was also high during follow-up, with a total of 42.4% of residents and 11.8% of staff members infected overall in the response facilities. In comparison, 13 LTCFs conducted testing as a preventive strategy before a case was identified. Although the majority of these LTCFs identified at least one COVID-19 case, the prevalence was significantly lower at initial testing in both residents and staff members (0.5% and 1.0%, respectively) and overall after follow-up (1.5% and 1.7%, respectively). These findings indicate that early awareness of infections might help facilities prevent potential outbreaks by prioritizing and adhering more strictly to infection prevention and control (IPC) recommendations, resulting in fewer infections than would occur when relying on symptom-based screening (6,7).

Facility-wide testing in LTCFs (i.e., skilled nursing, memory care, and assisted living facilities) in Fulton County began when the first COVID-19 LTCF outbreak was identified in March 2020. Because SARS-CoV-2 test kits and staffing capacity were limited, facility-wide testing at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic focused on LTCFs that already had at least one known confirmed case of COVID-19 in a resident or staff member; these initial cases were detected through testing of symptomatic persons. Testing was carried out 1–5 days after identification of the index case,* depending on Fulton County Board of Health (FCBOH) field testing team availability. Mass testing in LTCFs without known infections began on April 29† when additional testing support was provided by the National Guard. A 1-day testing event for consenting residents and staff members was held at each LTCF during March 31–May 18 to identify the baseline infection prevalence, and symptom-based screening was conducted for 4 weeks thereafter to identify subsequent cases. Testing at 15 facilities was conducted in response to a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection identified through symptom-based screening; those tested at these 15 facilities were referred to as “the response group.” There were 13 LTCFs that conducted preemptive testing before any case had been identified§; those tested at these 13 facilities were referred to as “the preventive group.”

Trained health care staff members from FCBOH and the National Guard collected nasopharyngeal swab samples at 22 LTCFs. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at various Georgia laboratories; a confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as a positive RT-PCR test result. When test results were received from participating laboratories they were immediately reported to the facilities, and IPC guidance and implementation support was provided at sites where positive results were identified to mitigate further disease transmission (6). Six LTCFs (three in each group) contracted with private companies to collect nasopharyngeal swabs and perform RT-PCR testing; these results were reported to FCBOH. Sample collection, transportation, and testing were conducted in accordance with the most recent CDC guidelines (8). Staff members absent on the day of testing but who provided evidence of a positive RT-PCR test result were included in this analysis, and those employed and tested at multiple LTCFs were counted in each facility’s staff census and case count. One LTCF declined testing for all staff members. Each LTCF’s number and proportion of SARS-CoV-2–positive RT-PCR test results, hospitalizations, and deaths among residents and staff members were calculated based on the sum of cases identified through mass testing and throughout 4 weeks of follow-up symptom-based screening.¶ Fisher’s exact tests were used to test differences between facility groups; p-values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by the Georgia Department of Public Health and determined to be consistent with public health surveillance as described in Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46.102(1)(2).

Overall, 5,671 persons from 28 LTCFs were tested, including 2,868 (50.6%) residents and 2,803 (49.4%) staff members. During the facility-wide testing events, 637 (11.2%) persons received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, including 484 (16.9%) residents and 153 (5.5%) staff members.** At the end of the follow-up period, 348 additional positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were reported, for a total of 985 (17.4%) persons with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (residents = 740 [25.8%]; staff members = 245 [8.7%]). At the time of initial testing, resident prevalence was 28.0% in the response group and 0.5% in the preventive group (p<0.01). Among staff members, prevalence at initial testing was 7.4% in the response group and 1.0% in the preventive group (p<0.01). Eight (61.5%) LTCFs in the preventive group reported at least one COVID-19 infection at the time of initial testing. After 4 weeks of follow-up, the overall resident prevalence was 42.4% and 1.5% in the response and preventive LTCFs, respectively, and prevalence among staff members was 11.8% and 1.7% in the response and preventive groups, respectively (p<0.001 for both residents and staff members) (Table).

Among the 985 persons who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 during and after the facility-wide testing, 164 (16.6%) required hospitalization, and 113 (11.5%) died. Most hospitalizations (158; 96.3%) occurred in the response group, but the proportion of residents hospitalized because of COVID-19 did not differ significantly between the response (19.9%) and preventive (29.4%) groups (p = 0.36). Similarly, the proportion of residents in the response group who died (15.1%) was similar to that in the preventive group (17.6%) (p = 0.73); however, 109 (96.5%) of all 113 deaths occurred in the response group LTCFs; only one death occurred in a staff member, and that was in the preventive group.

"Association Between CMS Quality Ratings and COVID-19 Outbreaks in Nursing Homes — West Virginia, March 17–June 11, 2020","Nursing homes are high-risk settings for outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). During the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. health departments worked to improve infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in nursing homes to prevent outbreaks and limit the spread of COVID-19 in affected facilities; however, limited resources have hampered health departments’ ability to rapidly provide IPC support to all nursing homes within their jurisdictions. Since 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has published health inspection results and quality ratings based on their Five-Star Quality Rating System for all CMS-certified nursing homes (3); these ratings might be associated with facility-level risk factors for COVID-19 outbreaks. On April 17, 2020, West Virginia became the first state to mandate and conduct COVID-19 testing for all nursing home residents and staff members to identify and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in these settings (4). West Virginia’s census of nursing home outbreaks was used to examine associations between CMS star ratings and COVID-19 outbreaks. Outbreaks, defined as two or more cases within 14 days (with at least one resident case), were identified in 14 (11%) of 123 nursing homes. Compared with 1-star–rated (lowest rated) nursing homes, the odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were 87% lower among 2- to 3-star–rated facilities (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03–0.54) and 94% lower among 4- to 5-star–rated facilities (aOR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.006–0.39). Health departments could use star ratings to help identify priority nursing homes in their jurisdictions to inform the allocation of IPC resources. Efforts to mitigate outbreaks in high-risk nursing homes are necessary to reduce overall COVID-19 mortality and associated disparities. Moreover, such efforts should incorporate activities to improve the overall quality of life and care of nursing home residents and staff members and address the social and health inequities that have been recognized as a prominent feature of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (5).

COVID-19 surveillance data from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources were used to identify all nursing home outbreaks during March 14–June 11, 2020. These outbreaks were identified through routine COVID-19 surveillance and by universal nursing home testing, which was conducted per the governor’s executive order* during April 21–May 8, 2020 (4). For this report, an outbreak was defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases occurring within 14 days in a nursing home, with at least one of those cases in a resident.

Nursing home data were downloaded from the CMS Nursing Home Compare website† on June 11, 2020, and included data on all CMS-certified nursing homes (3). CMS-trained inspectors conduct annual unannounced health inspections of all nursing homes; inspection deficiencies are recorded, scored, and summarized into an overall five-star rating (1 star = lowest quality, 5 star = highest quality) that is adjusted based on nursing home staffing levels (e.g., nursing hours per resident) and quality of care measures (e.g., hospital readmissions). This analysis is based on star ratings from the most recent nursing home inspections in West Virginia, conducted during December 13, 2018–February 26, 2020, approximately 2 weeks before the first reported COVID-19 case in the state. Most inspections were conducted in 2019 (101 of 123; 82%) and 2020 (21; 17%); one inspection was conducted in 2018.

Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to evaluate continuous variables and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables, to compare facilities with and without COVID-19 outbreaks (outbreak- and nonoutbreak facilities) on several CMS survey measures, including ownership type, average daily number of residents, average daily staffing hours per resident, cumulative county-level COVID-19 incidence, and number of CMS inspection deficiencies, fines, and penalties. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between overall star ratings and COVID-19 outbreaks, adjusting for county-level COVID-19 incidence (analyzed as continuous cases per 100,000 population) and average daily number of facility residents (analyzed as continuous number of facility residents per day). To facilitate interpretation of the OR for county-level incidence and average daily number of facility residents, the variables were rescaled by a factor of 10 (i.e., divided by 10). The overall star rating was analyzed as a three-level variable (1-star, 2–3-star, and 4–5-star). The outcome of interest was experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak, and the reference group was 1-star–rated nursing homes. ORs and 95% CIs were estimated with R statistical software (version 3.6.1; The R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§

As of June 11, 2020, there were 123 CMS-certified nursing homes in West Virginia, including 18 (15%) rated as 5-star, 22 (18%) as 4-star, 28 (23%) as 3-star, 34 (28%) as 2-star, and 20 (16%) as 1-star; one (1%) nursing home was unrated (Table 1). Most (19 of 20, 95%) 1-star–rated nursing homes were for-profit operations and tended to have more residents than did higher rated nursing homes. Nurse staffing levels were generally lower in 1-star–rated facilities, compared with those in higher rated facilities (Table 1).

As of June 11, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported COVID-19 outbreaks in 14 (11%) nursing homes, with 226 cases among residents (median = 2.5 per nursing home, range = 1–71) and 140 cases among staff members (median = 4, range = 0–39). Average daily resident census in outbreak facilities (92) was higher than that in nonoutbreak facilities (76) (p = 0.03) (Table 2). Total nurse staffing hours per resident per day were similar in outbreak and nonoutbreak facilities, but mean number of nurse aide hours per resident per day in outbreak facilities (1.9) was lower than was that in nonoutbreak facilities (2.2) (p = 0.02). COVID-19 incidence was higher in counties where outbreak facilities were located (mean = 178 per 100,000) compared with that in counties where nonoutbreak facilities were located (105 per 100,000) (p = 0.001). The mean number of health deficiencies was higher in outbreak facilities (mean = 15) than in nonoutbreak facilities (mean = 11) (p = 0.03) (Table 3).

Seven (50%) of 14 outbreak facilities had 1-star ratings compared with 13 (12%) of 109 nonoutbreak facilities (Table 3). One outbreak facility was a CMS-designated Special Focus Facility and did not receive a star rating and was not included in regression analysis. Special Focus Facility designation is reserved for the lowest rated facilities in the state with a history of serious inspection deficiencies (i.e., potential to harm residents). In unadjusted analyses, the odds of a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing home increased by 5% for each additional 10 incident cases per 100,000 in the county (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.00–1.09) and by 14% for each additional 10 facility residents (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 0.98–1.33). Compared with 1-star–rated nursing homes, the unadjusted odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were significantly lower among 2- to 3-star–rated nursing homes (OR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.04-0.59) and 4- to 5-star–rated nursing homes (OR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.003). After adjusting for county-level COVID-19 incidence and the number of facility residents, odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were significantly lower in higher quality nursing homes, based on star rating. Compared with 1-star–rated nursing homes, the odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were 87% lower among 2- to 3-star–rated nursing homes (aOR = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.03–0.54) and 94% lower among 4- to 5-star–rated nursing homes (aOR = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.003–0.39); specifically, the odds of a COVID-19 outbreak among 1-star–rated nursing homes were approximately seven times higher than among 2- to 3-star–rated facilities and approximately 17 times higher than among 4- to 5-star–rated facilities after controlling for number of residents and county-level incidence.",9/17/20 0:00,
"Decreased Influenza Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic — United States, Australia, Chile, and South Africa, 2020","After recognition of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), by mid- to late February 2020, indicators of influenza activity began to decline in the Northern Hemisphere. These changes were attributed to both artifactual changes related to declines in routine health seeking for respiratory illness as well as real changes in influenza virus circulation because of widespread implementation of measures to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Data from clinical laboratories in the United States indicated a 61% decrease in the number of specimens submitted (from a median of 49,696 per week during September 29, 2019–February 29, 2020, to 19,537 during March 1–May 16, 2020) and a 98% decrease in influenza activity as measured by percentage of submitted specimens testing positive (from a median of 19.34% to 0.33%). Interseasonal (i.e., summer) circulation of influenza in the United States (May 17–August 8, 2020) is currently at historical lows (median = 0.20% tests positive in 2020 versus 2.35% in 2019, 1.04% in 2018, and 2.36% in 2017). Influenza data reported to the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) FluNet platform from three Southern Hemisphere countries that serve as robust sentinel sites for influenza from Oceania (Australia), South America (Chile), and Southern Africa (South Africa) showed very low influenza activity during June–August 2020, the months that constitute the typical Southern Hemisphere influenza season. In countries or jurisdictions where extensive community mitigation measures are maintained (e.g., face masks, social distancing, school closures, and teleworking), those locations might have little influenza circulation during the upcoming 2020–21 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The use of community mitigation measures for the COVID-19 pandemic, plus influenza vaccination, are likely to be effective in reducing the incidence and impact of influenza, and some of these mitigation measures could have a role in preventing influenza in future seasons. However, given the novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty of continued community mitigation measures, it is important to plan for seasonal influenza circulation in the United States this fall and winter. Influenza vaccination of all persons aged ≥6 months remains the best method for influenza prevention and is especially important this season when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus might cocirculate (1).

Data from approximately 300 U.S. clinical laboratories located throughout all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia that participate in virologic surveillance for influenza through either the U.S. WHO Collaborating Laboratories System or the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System* were used for this analysis. Clinical laboratories primarily test respiratory specimens for diagnostic purposes, and data from these laboratories provide useful information on the timing and intensity of influenza activity. The median number of specimens tested per week and the median percentage of samples testing positive for influenza during September 29, 2019–February 29, 2020 (surveillance weeks 40–9, the period before the March 1, 2020 declaration of a national emergency related to COVID-19†) were compared with those tested during March 1–May 16, 2020 (weeks 10–20 after the declaration); data from three previous influenza seasons are presented as a comparison. To assess influenza virus activity in the Southern Hemisphere, influenza laboratory data from clinical and surveillance platforms reported from Australia, Chile, and South Africa to WHO’s FluNet§ platform were analyzed. For each country, the percentage of samples testing positive for influenza for April–July (weeks 14–31) for four seasons (2017–2020) are presented. Selected measures implemented to respond to COVID-19 in these countries were ascertained from government websites. All data used were in the public domain.

In the United States, influenza activity (measured by percentage of respiratory specimens submitted for influenza testing that yielded positive results) began to increase in early November 2019, and >20% of specimens were positive during December 15, 2019–March 7, 2020 (weeks 51–10), after which activity declined sharply (Figure 1). Percent positivity peaked on week 6 at 30.25% and decreased 14.90% by week 9, compared with an 89.77% decrease during weeks 10–13. By the week of March 22, 2020 (week 13), when the number of samples tested remained very high, percent positivity dropped to 2.3%, and since the week of April 5, 2020 (week 15), has remained <1%. The median number of specimens tested for influenza each week decreased from 49,696 during September 29, 2019–February 29, 2020 (weeks 40–9), to 19,537 during March 1–May 16, 2020 (weeks 10–20), representing a 61% decrease. During these same two periods, influenza activity decreased 98%, from a median of 19.34% to 0.33% of submitted respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. Interseasonal circulation of influenza in the United States (May 17–August 8, 2020; weeks 21–32) is now at historical lows (weekly median 0.20% of samples testing positive in 2020 versus 2.35% in 2019, 1.04% in 2018 and 2.36% in 2017).

In the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, Chile, and South Africa, only 33 influenza positive test results were detected among 60,031 specimens tested in Australia, 12 among 21,178 specimens tested in Chile, and six among 2,098 specimens tested in South Africa, for a total of 51 influenza positive specimens (0.06%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04%–0.08%) among 83,307 tested in these three countries during April–July 2020 (weeks 14–31). In contrast, during April–July in 2017–2019, 24,512 specimens tested positive for influenza (13.7%, 95% CI = 13.6%–13.9%) among 178,690 tested in these three countries (Figure 2).

In the United States, the COVID-19 national emergency was declared on March 1, 2020, but states began implementing a range of COVID-19 mitigation measures in late February, including school closures, bans on mass gatherings, and stay-at-home orders (2). In addition, some emphasis was placed on individual measures, such as mask wearing, staying home while sick, and social distancing. In Australia, a 14-day mandatory hotel quarantine was introduced for all returned travelers on March 29; regional lockdowns began in early April, followed by a stay-at-home recommendation and bans on gatherings in mid-April. Some easing of measures began in late April.¶ In Chile, the president declared a state of emergency on March 18, which remains in effect into September. In addition, in mid-March an overnight curfew and a nationwide lockdown were implemented. Since then, the lockdown has been lifted regionally, based on disease activity; however, recommendations to stay at home and socially distance, as well as mandatory use of masks are all still in place.** In South Africa, a total lockdown was imposed on April 9, with some easing of measures starting on May 1.†† The community mitigation strategies implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including both community and individual-level measures, appear to have substantially reduced transmission of influenza in all these countries.",9/17/20 0:00,
"Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 Outbreaks Associated with Child Care Facilities — Salt Lake City, Utah, April–July 2020","On September 11, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

Reports suggest that children aged ≥10 years can efficiently transmit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). However, limited data are available on SARS-CoV-2 transmission from young children, particularly in child care settings (3). To better understand transmission from young children, contact tracing data collected from three COVID-19 outbreaks in child care facilities in Salt Lake County, Utah, during April 1–July 10, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed to explore attack rates and transmission patterns. A total of 184 persons, including 110 (60%) children had a known epidemiologic link to one of these three facilities. Among these persons, 31 confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred; 13 (42%) in children. Among pediatric patients with facility-associated confirmed COVID-19, all had mild or no symptoms. Twelve children acquired COVID-19 in child care facilities. Transmission was documented from these children to at least 12 (26%) of 46 nonfacility contacts (confirmed or probable cases). One parent was hospitalized. Transmission was observed from two of three children with confirmed, asymptomatic COVID-19. Detailed contact tracing data show that children can play a role in transmission from child care settings to household contacts. Having SARS-CoV-2 testing available, timely results, and testing of contacts of persons with COVID-19 in child care settings regardless of symptoms can help prevent transmission. CDC guidance for child care programs recommends the use of face masks, particularly among staff members, especially when children are too young to wear masks, along with hand hygiene, frequent cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces, and staying home when ill to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (4).

Contact tracing* data collected during April 1–July 10, 2020 through Utah’s National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (EpiTrax) were used to retrospectively construct transmission chains from reported COVID-19 child care facility outbreaks, defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases within 14 days among staff members or attendees at the same facility. EpiTrax maintains records of epidemiologic linkage between index patients and contacts (defined as anyone who was within 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes ≤2 days before the patient’s symptom onset) and captures data on demographic characteristics, symptoms, exposures, testing, and the monitoring/isolation period. A confirmed case was defined as receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result. A probable case was an illness with COVID-19–compatible symptoms,† epidemiologically linked to the outbreak, but with no laboratory testing. For this report, the index case was defined as the first confirmed case identified in a person at the child care facility, and the primary case was defined as the earliest confirmed case linked to the outbreak. Pediatric patients were aged <18 years; adults were aged ≥18 years.

Persons with confirmed or probable child care facility–associated COVID-19 were required to isolate upon experiencing symptoms or receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Contacts were required to quarantine for 14 days after contact with a person with a confirmed case. Facility attack rates were calculated by including patients with confirmed and probable facility-associated cases (including the index patient) in the numerator and all facility staff members and attendees in the denominator. Overall attack rates include facility-associated cases (including the index case) and nonfacility contact (household and nonhousehold) cases in the numerator and all facility staff members and attendees and nonfacility contacts in the denominator; the primary case and cases linked to the primary case are excluded.

During April 1–July 10, Salt Lake County identified 17 child care facilities (day care facilities and day camps for school-aged children; henceforth, facilities) with at least two confirmed COVID-19 cases within a 14-day period. This report describes outbreaks in three facilities that experienced possible transmission within the facility and had complete contact investigation information. A total of 184 persons, including 74 (40%) adults (median age = 30 years; range = 19–78 years) and 110 (60%) children (median age = 7 years; range = 0.2–16 years), had a known epidemiologic link to one of these three facilities with an outbreak; 54% were female and 40% were male. Among these persons, 31 confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred (Table 1); 18 (58%) cases occurred in adults and 13 (42%) in children. Among all contacts, nine confirmed and seven probable cases occurred; the remaining 146 contacts had either negative test results (50; 27%), were asymptomatic and were not tested (94; 51%) or had unknown symptoms and testing information (2; 1%).

Among the 101 facility staff members and attendees, 22 (22%) confirmed COVID-19 cases (10 adult and 12 pediatric) were identified (Table 2), accounting for 71% of the 31 confirmed cases; the remaining nine (29%) cases occurred in contacts of staff members or attendees. Among the 12 facility-associated pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19, nine had mild symptoms, and three were asymptomatic. Among 83 contacts of these 12 pediatric patients, 46 (55%) were nonfacility contacts, including 12 (26%) who had confirmed (seven) and probable (five) COVID-19. Six of these cases occurred in mothers and three in siblings of the pediatric patients. Overall, 94 (58%) of 162 contacts of persons with facility-associated cases had no symptoms of COVID-19 and were not tested. Staff members at two of the facilities had a household contact with confirmed or probable COVID-19 and went to work while their household contact was symptomatic. These household contacts represented the primary cases in their respective outbreaks.",9/17/20 0:00,
"SARS-CoV-2–Associated Deaths Among Persons Aged <21 Years — United States, February 12–July 31, 2020","Discussion

During February 12–July 31, 2020, a total of 391,814 cases of COVID-19 and MIS-C (representing approximately 8% of all reported cases) (1,2) and 121 deaths (approximately 0.08% of all deaths) (1,2) were identified among persons aged <21 years in the United States. Four important findings were identified. First, although Hispanic, Black, and AI/AN persons represent 41% of the U.S. population aged <21 years (4), these groups accounted for approximately 75% of deaths in persons aged <21 years. Second, deaths were more prevalent among males and among persons aged 10–20 years; young adults aged 18–20 years accounted for nearly half of all deaths in this population. Third, 75% of decedents had at least one underlying condition, and 45% had two or more underlying conditions. Fourth, a substantial proportion of out-of-hospital deaths in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred among all age groups in this analysis.

Among infants, children, and adolescents hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (5) and cases of MIS-C (6), persons from racial and ethnic minority groups are overrepresented. These racial/ethnic groups are also disproportionately represented among essential workers unable to work from their homes (7), resulting in higher risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with potential secondary transmission among household members, including infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. In addition, disparities in social determinants of health, such as crowded living conditions, food and housing insecurity, wealth and educational gaps, and racial discrimination, likely contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 and MIS-C incidence and outcomes (7). Finally, higher rates of adverse outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities are likely related to challenges in seeking care for various reasons, including difficulty and delays in accessing health care services because of lack of insurance, child care, transportation, or paid sick leave, and social determinants of health that contribute to higher prevalence of medical conditions (7).

Thirty-nine out-of-hospital SARS-CoV-2–associated deaths occurred at home or in the ED among persons aged <21 years. In the United States, significant reductions in ED visits (8) and childhood immunizations (9) occurred during March–April 2020, suggesting that necessary care might be delayed or deferred during the pandemic. Although infants, children, and adolescents are more likely to have milder COVID-19 illness than are adults (3), complications, including MIS-C (6) and respiratory failure (5,6), do occur in these populations. Persons infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should be followed closely so that clinical deterioration can be detected early. In this analysis, the number of deaths was highest in persons aged 14–20 years. Adolescents especially need patient-centered follow-up services that are developmentally appropriate (10).

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, case-based surveillance data††† underestimate cases of COVID-19 compared with aggregate case reports§§§ from states, and data for some variables in case-based surveillance (e.g., demographic variables) are missing. Therefore, data on cases and deaths by race/ethnicity are not comparable and case fatality rates by race/ethnicity cannot be calculated. Second, the possibility exists that all deaths were not recognized or reported, in part because of incomplete testing, failure to update vital status after death of a previously reported case of COVID-19 or MIS-C, or delays in reporting SARS-CoV-2–associated deaths because of the lengthy process for cause of death ascertainment. Third, autopsy findings and death certificates were not available to verify cause of death for this report. More detailed review of available medical and death records is currently underway in collaboration with public health jurisdictions. Fourth, although guidance for death certificate coding for COVID-19 is available,¶¶¶ a standard surveillance case definition for SARS-CoV-2–associated death is not in use in the United States; case ascertainment and data collection procedures were nonuniform among jurisdictions. Finally, during most of the time between February 12 and July 31, 2020, the majority of U.S. early child care providers, schools, and other educational institutions were closed, gatherings of children and adolescents were reduced, and testing and treatment protocols changed.**** As early child care providers, schools, and other educational institutions reopen for in-person learning and treatment protocols continue to evolve, the incidence of pediatric SARS-CoV-2–associated deaths might change, and pediatric case and death surveillance should continue.

Adolescents and young adults, Hispanic, Black, and AI/AN persons, and persons with underlying medical conditions are disproportionately represented among deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 in persons aged <21 years reported to CDC. Infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, particularly those from racial and ethnic minority groups at higher risk, those with underlying medical conditions, and their caregivers, need clear, consistent, and developmentally, linguistically, and culturally appropriate COVID-19 prevention messages (e.g., related to mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene). To ensure accurate surveillance, it is important that health care providers and health departments assure follow-up for infants, children, adolescents, and young adults infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and document and report underlying medical conditions and cause of death related to COVID-19. Health departments, in collaboration with school districts and the communities they serve, can evaluate and improve health promotion, health access, and health equity for all infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. Ultimately, health departments, health providers, and community partners can mobilize to remove systemic barriers that contribute to health disparities.††††",9/17/20 0:00,
"Prevalence of Underlying Medical Conditions Among Selected Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers — Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 31 States, 2017–2018","For all essential workers, and particularly those at high risk because of underlying medical conditions, prioritization of exposure controls and health care access is needed to reduce the potential for SARS-CoV-2 exposure and prevent and treat underlying conditions.

Certain underlying medical conditions are associated with higher risks for severe morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). Prevalence of these underlying conditions among workers differs by industry and occupation. Many essential workers, who hold jobs critical to the continued function of infrastructure operations (2), have high potential for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, because their jobs require close contact with patients, the general public, or coworkers. To assess the baseline prevalence of underlying conditions among workers in six essential occupations and seven essential industries, CDC analyzed data from the 2017 and 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys, the most recent data available.* This report presents unadjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for selected underlying conditions. Among workers in the home health aide occupation and the nursing home/rehabilitation industry, aPRs were significantly elevated for the largest number of conditions. Extra efforts to minimize exposure risk and prevent and treat underlying conditions are warranted to protect workers whose jobs increase their risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

BRFSS is an annual, state-based, random-digit–dialed landline and cellular telephone survey collecting demographic and health-related information among noninstitutionalized U.S residents aged ≥18 years. BRFSS includes standard core questions and optional modules, including an industry and occupation module. All participants are asked to report their height and weight and also asked “Has a doctor, nurse, or other health practitioner ever told you that you have…” followed by a list of underlying conditions.† In 2017 and 2018, 31 states§ administered the industry and occupation module for at least 1 year to currently or recently employed participants; the study sample comprised currently employed module respondents.¶ Open-ended responses to questions eliciting respondent industry and occupation** were coded to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2010 industry and occupation codes.†† Among states using the industry and occupation questions, the median overall survey response rate was 42.5% in 2017 §§ and 49.1% in 2018. ¶¶

Respondent demographic characteristics, as well as weighted, unadjusted prevalences and aPRs for selected underlying conditions, were obtained for a subset of critical infrastructure worker groups selected because of their inability to work from home or physically distance from others at work, and their potential exposure to infectious disease (3,4), as well as adequate sample size in the data set.*** Six occupation groups were selected: 1) health practitioners (licensed health care professionals except technicians/technologists), 2) health technicians and technologists, 3) other health care support (except home health), 4) patient and personal care aides in the home health industry (home health aides), 5) protective services (correctional officers, police, sheriffs, patrol officers, firefighters, and their supervisors), and 6) teachers (preschool through grade 12). Seven industry groups were selected: 1) ambulatory health care, 2) hospitals, 3) nursing homes (nursing and residential care facilities), 4) essential retail (grocery/other food stores, alcohol stores, pharmacies, and gas stations), 5) food manufacturing, 6) transit (bus service/urban transit, taxi/limousine, postal services, and couriers/messengers), and 7) trucking. Health conditions from the BRFSS core module with strong or mixed evidence of associations with severe outcomes from COVID-19 that were evaluated included asthma (current, ever diagnosed), cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), coronary heart disease (CHD; myocardial infarction, angina, or coronary heart disease), chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2, calculated from respondent’s self-reported height and weight), severe obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m2), and stroke. Hypertension questions were asked only in 2017.

For each occupation or industry, demographic distributions and unadjusted prevalences for each chronic condition were calculated using the SURVEYFREQ procedure in SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Logistic regression in SUDAAN (version 11.0.1; RTI International) was used to calculate aPRs to compare the prevalence of each condition in the occupation (or industry) of interest to its prevalence among workers from all other U.S. Census-coded occupations (or industries), essential and nonessential combined, except the group of interest. Adjustments were made for age group (18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, ≥70 years), sex (male, female), and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, Black, Asian, or other race, and Hispanic). aPRs with confidence intervals not spanning the null value were considered statistically significant. Data were weighted and analyzed in accordance with the survey’s complex sampling design.

The study population comprised 213,518 respondents meeting the analytic criteria (Table 1). At least 15% (weighted percentage) of workers in the health practitioner and home health aide occupations and the ambulatory health care, transit, and trucking industries were aged ≥60 years. Males comprised 85.2% of protective service workers and 89.2% of trucking industry workers. At least 25% of home health aide occupation, nursing home industry, and transit industry workers were non-Hispanic Black. The percentages of Hispanic workers were highest in the home health aide occupation (20%) and the food manufacturing industry (36%).

Prevalences of preexisting underlying conditions varied by occupation (Table 2) and industry (Table 3). Obesity and hypertension were the most common conditions in every essential worker group. Among occupations, home health aides had the highest unadjusted prevalence estimate for every chronic condition except severe obesity and had significantly elevated aPRs for five conditions (chronic kidney disease, COPD, diabetes, obesity, and severe obesity,). For health care support workers (other than home health), aPRs were significantly elevated for diabetes, obesity, and severe obesity. In contrast, among health practitioners, aPRs for many conditions were significantly below 1.0. Among workers in the nursing home industry, aPRs for CHD, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and severe obesity were significantly elevated. Non-health care industries with statistically significant elevations in aPRs for more than one underlying condition included transit (current asthma and diabetes) and trucking (COPD, obesity, and severe obesity).",9/10/20 0:00,
"Delay or Avoidance of Medical Care Because of COVID-19–Related Concerns — United States, June 2020","Discussion

As of June 30, 2020, an estimated 41% of U.S. adults reported having delayed or avoided medical care during the pandemic because of concerns about COVID-19, including 12% who reported having avoided urgent or emergency care. These findings align with recent reports that hospital admissions, overall emergency department (ED) visits, and the number of ED visits for heart attack, stroke, and hyperglycemic crisis have declined since the start of the pandemic (3–5), and that excess deaths directly or indirectly related to COVID-19 have increased in 2020 versus prior years (2). Nearly one third of adult respondents reported having delayed or avoided routine medical care, which might reflect adherence to community mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders, temporary closures of health facilities, or additional factors. However, if routine care avoidance were to be sustained, adults could miss opportunities for management of chronic conditions, receipt of routine vaccinations, or early detection of new conditions, which might worsen outcomes.

Avoidance of both urgent or emergency and routine medical care because of COVID-19 concerns was highly prevalent among unpaid caregivers for adults, respondents with two or more underlying medical conditions, and persons with disabilities. For caregivers who reported caring for adults at increased risk for severe COVID-19, concern about exposure of care recipients might contribute to care avoidance. Persons with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for severe COVID-19 (6) are more likely to require care to monitor and treat these conditions, potentially contributing to their more frequent report of avoidance. Moreover, persons at increased risk for severe COVID-19 might have avoided health care facilities because of perceived or actual increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, particularly at the onset of the pandemic. However, health care facilities are implementing important safety precautions to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients and personnel. In contrast, delay or avoidance of care might increase risk for life-threatening medical emergencies. In a recent study, states with large numbers of COVID-19–associated deaths also experienced large proportional increases in deaths from other underlying causes, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease (7). For persons with disabilities, accessing medical services might be challenging because of disruptions in essential support services, which can result in adverse health outcomes. Medical services for persons with disabilities might also be disrupted because of reduced availability of accessible transportation, reduced communication in accessible formats, perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk, and specialized needs that are difficult to address with routine telehealth delivery during the pandemic response. Increasing accessibility of medical and telehealth services¶¶¶ might help prevent delay of needed care.

Increased prevalences of reported urgent or emergency care avoidance among Black adults and Hispanic adults compared with White adults are especially concerning given increased COVID-19-associated mortality among Black adults and Hispanic adults (8). In the United States, the age-adjusted COVID-19 hospitalization rates are approximately five times higher among Black persons and four times higher among Hispanic persons than are those among White persons (9). Factors contributing to racial and ethnic disparities in SARS-CoV-2 exposure, illness, and mortality might include long-standing structural inequities that influence life expectancy, including prevalence and underlying medical conditions, health insurance status, and health care access and utilization, as well as work and living circumstances, including use of public transportation and essential worker status. Communities, health care systems, and public health agencies can foster equity by working together to ensure access to information, testing, and care to assure maintenance and management of physical and mental health.

The higher prevalence of medical care delay or avoidance among respondents with health insurance versus those without insurance might reflect differences in medical care-seeking behaviors. Before the pandemic, persons without insurance sought medical care much less frequently than did those with insurance (10), resulting in fewer opportunities for medical care delay or avoidance.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, self-reported data are subject to recall, response, and social desirability biases. Second, the survey did not assess reasons for COVID-19–associated care avoidance, such as adherence to public health recommendations; closure of health care provider facilities; reduced availability of public transportation; fear of exposure to infection with SARS-CoV-2; or availability, accessibility, and acceptance or recognition of telemedicine as a means of providing care in lieu of in-person services. Third, the survey did not assess baseline patterns of care-seeking or timing or duration of care avoidance. Fourth, perceptions of whether a condition was life-threatening might vary among respondents. Finally, although quota sampling methods and survey weighting were employed to improve cohort representativeness, this web-based survey might not be fully representative of the U.S. population for income, educational attainment, and access to technology. However, the findings are consistent with reported declines in hospital admissions and ED visits during the pandemic (3–5).

CDC has issued guidance to assist persons at increased risk for severe COVID-19 in staying healthy and safely following treatment plans**** and to prepare health care facilities to safely deliver care during the pandemic.†††† Additional public outreach in accessible formats tailored for diverse audiences might encourage these persons to seek necessary care. Messages could highlight the risks of delaying needed care, especially among persons with underlying medical conditions, and the importance of timely emergency care. Patient concerns related to potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in health care settings could be addressed by describing facilities’ precautions to reduce exposure risk.

Further exploration of underlying reasons for medical care avoidance is needed, including among persons with disabilities, persons with underlying health conditions, unpaid caregivers for adults, and those who face structural inequities. If care were avoided because of concern about SARS-CoV-2 exposure or if there were closures or limited options for in-person services, providing accessible telehealth or in-home health care could address some care needs. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, persons experiencing a medical emergency should seek and be provided care without delay (3).",9/10/20 0:00,
"Community and Close Contact Exposures Associated with COVID-19 Among Symptomatic Adults ≥18 Years in 11 Outpatient Health Care Facilities — United States, July 2020","Eating and drinking on-site at locations that offer such options might be important risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Efforts to reduce possible exposures where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain, such as when eating and drinking, should be considered to protect customers, employees, and communities.

Findings from a case-control investigation of symptomatic outpatients from 11 U.S. health care facilities found that close contact with persons with known COVID-19 or going to locations that offer on-site eating and drinking options were associated with COVID-19 positivity. Adults with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant than were those with negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.

Community and close contact exposures continue to drive the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CDC and other public health authorities recommend community mitigation strategies to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1,2). Characterization of community exposures can be difficult to assess when widespread transmission is occurring, especially from asymptomatic persons within inherently interconnected communities. Potential exposures, such as close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19, have primarily been assessed among COVID-19 cases, without a non-COVID-19 comparison group (3,4). To assess community and close contact exposures associated with COVID-19, exposures reported by case-patients (154) were compared with exposures reported by control-participants (160). Case-patients were symptomatic adults (persons aged ≥18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Control-participants were symptomatic outpatient adults from the same health care facilities who had negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. Close contact with a person with known COVID-19 was more commonly reported among case-patients (42%) than among control-participants (14%). Case-patients were more likely to have reported dining at a restaurant (any area designated by the restaurant, including indoor, patio, and outdoor seating) in the 2 weeks preceding illness onset than were control-participants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5–3.8). Restricting the analysis to participants without known close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19, case-patients were more likely to report dining at a restaurant (aOR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.9–4.3) or going to a bar/coffee shop (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.5–10.1) than were control-participants. Exposures and activities where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain, including going to places that offer on-site eating or drinking, might be important risk factors for acquiring COVID-19. As communities reopen, efforts to reduce possible exposures at locations that offer on-site eating and drinking options should be considered to protect customers, employees, and communities.

This investigation included adults aged ≥18 years who received a first test for SARS-CoV-2 infection at an outpatient testing or health care center at one of 11 Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the Critically Ill (IVY) Network sites* during July 1–29, 2020 (5). A COVID-19 case was confirmed by RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory specimens. Assays varied among facilities. Each site generated lists of adults tested within the study period by laboratory result; adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected by random sampling as case-patients. For each case-patient, two adults with negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results were randomly selected as control-participants and matched by age, sex, and study location. After randomization and matching, 615 potential case-patients and 1,212 control-participants were identified and contacted 14–23 days after the date they received SARS-CoV-2 testing. Screening questions were asked to identify eligible adults. Eligible adults for the study were symptomatic at the time of their first SARS-CoV-2 test.

CDC personnel administered structured interviews in English or five other languages† by telephone and entered data into REDCap software (6). Among 802 adults contacted and who agreed to participate (295 case-patients and 507 control-participants), 332 reported symptoms at the time of initial SARS-CoV-2 testing and were enrolled in the study. Eighteen interviews were excluded because of nonresponse to the community exposure questions. The final analytic sample (314) included 154 case-patients (positive SARS-CoV-2 test results) and 160 control-participants (negative SARS-CoV-2 test results). Among nonparticipants, 470 were ineligible (i.e., were not symptomatic or had multiple tests), and 163 refused to participate. This activity was reviewed by CDC and participating sites and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§

Data collected included demographic characteristics, information on underlying chronic medical conditions,¶ symptoms, convalescence (self-rated physical and mental health), close contact (within 6 feet for ≥15 minutes) with a person with known COVID-19, workplace exposures, mask-wearing behavior, and community activities ≤14 days before symptom onset. Participants were asked about wearing a mask and possible community exposure activities (e.g., gatherings with ≤10 or >10 persons in a home; shopping; dining at a restaurant; going to an office setting, salon, gym, bar/coffee shop, or church/religious gathering; or using public transportation) on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from “never” to “more than once per day” or “always”; for analysis, community activity responses were dichotomized as never versus one or more times during the 14 days before illness onset. For each reported activity, participants were asked to quantify degree of adherence to recommendations such as wearing a face mask of any kind or social distancing among other persons at that location, with response options ranging from “none” to “almost all.” Descriptive and statistical analyses were performed to compare case-patients with control-participants, assessing differences in demographic characteristics, community exposures, and close contact. Although an effort was made initially to match case-patients to control-participants based on a 1:2 ratio, not all potential participants were eligible or completed an interview, and therefore an unmatched analysis was performed. Unconditional logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations with exchangeable correlation structure correcting standard error estimates for site-level clustering were used to assess differences in community exposures between case-patients and control-participants, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and presence of one or more underlying chronic medical conditions. In each model, SARS-CoV-2 test result (i.e., positive or negative) was the outcome variable, and each community exposure activity was the predictor variable. The first model included the full analytic sample (314). A second model was restricted to participants who did not report close contact to a person with COVID-19 (89 case-patients and 136 control-participants). Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute).

Compared with case-patients, control-participants were more likely to be non-Hispanic White (p<0.01), have a college degree or higher (p<0.01), and report at least one underlying chronic medical condition (p = 0.01) (Table). In the 14 days before illness onset, 71% of case-patients and 74% of control-participants reported always using cloth face coverings or other mask types when in public. Close contact with one or more persons with known COVID-19 was reported by 42% of case-patients compared with 14% of control-participants (p<0.01), and most (51%) close contacts were family members.

Approximately one half of all participants reported shopping and visiting others inside a home (in groups of ≤10 persons) on ≥1 day during the 14 days preceding symptom onset. No significant differences were observed in the bivariate analysis between case-patients and control-participants in shopping; gatherings with ≤10 persons in a home; going to an office setting; going to a salon; gatherings with >10 persons in a home; going to a gym; using public transportation; going to a bar/coffee shop; or attending church/religious gathering. However, case-patients were more likely to have reported dining at a restaurant (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.5–3.8) in the 2 weeks before illness onset than were control-participants (Figure). Further, when the analysis was restricted to the 225 participants who did not report recent close contact with a person with known COVID-19, case-patients were more likely than were control-participants to have reported dining at a restaurant (aOR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.9–4.3) or going to a bar/coffee shop (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.5–10.1). Among 107 participants who reported dining at a restaurant and 21 participants who reported going to a bar/coffee shop, case-patients were less likely to report observing almost all patrons at the restaurant adhering to recommendations such as wearing a mask or social distancing (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively).",9/24/20 0:00,
"Characteristics of Health Care Personnel with COVID-19 — United States, February 12–April 9, 2020","Discussion

As of April 9, 2020, a total of 9,282 U.S. HCP with confirmed COVID-19 had been reported to CDC. This is likely an underestimation because HCP status was available for only 16% of reported cases nationwide. HCP with mild or asymptomatic infections might also have been less likely to be tested, thus less likely to be reported. Overall, only 3% (9,282 of 315,531) of reported cases were among HCP; however, among states with more complete reporting of HCP status, HCP accounted for 11% (1,689 of 15,194) of reported cases. The total number of COVID-19 cases among HCP is expected to rise as more U.S. communities experience widespread transmission. Compared with reports of COVID-19 patients in the overall populations of China and Italy (4,5), reports of HCP patients in the United States during February 12–April 9 were slightly younger, and a higher proportion were women; this likely reflects the age and sex distributions among the U.S. HCP workforce. Race and ethnicity distributions among HCP patients reported to CDC are different from those in the overall U.S. population but are more similar to those in the HCP workforce.¶,**

Among HCP patients who reported having contact with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient in health care, household, or community settings, the majority reported contact that occurred in health care settings. However, there were also known exposures in households and in the community, highlighting the potential for exposure in multiple settings, especially as community transmission increases. Further, transmission might come from unrecognized sources, including presymptomatic or asymptomatic persons (6,7). Together, these exposure possibilities underscore several important considerations for prevention. Done alone, contact tracing after recognized occupational exposures likely will fail to identify many HCP at risk for developing COVID-19. Additional measures that will likely reduce the risk for infected HCP transmitting the virus to colleagues and patients include screening all HCP for fever and respiratory symptoms at the beginning of their shifts, prioritizing HCP for testing, and ensuring options to discourage working while ill (e.g., flexible and nonpunitive medical leave policies). Given the evidence for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission (7), covering the nose and mouth (i.e., source control) is recommended in community settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.†† Assuring source control among all HCP, patients, and visitors in health care settings is another promising strategy for further reducing transmission. Even if everyone in a health care setting is covering their nose and mouth to contain their respiratory secretions, it is still critical that, when caring for patients, HCP continue to wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., gown, N95 respirator [or facemask if N95 is not available], eye protection, and gloves for COVID-19 patient care). Training of HCP on preventive measures, including hand hygiene and PPE use, is another important safeguard against transmission in health care settings.

Among HCP with COVID-19 whose age status was known, 8%–10% were reported to be hospitalized. This is lower than the 21%–31% of U.S. COVID-19 cases with known hospitalization status described in a recent report (8) and might reflect the younger median age (42 years) of HCP patients compared with that of reported COVID-19 patients overall, as well as prioritization of HCP for testing, which might identify less severe illness. Similar to earlier findings (8), increasing age was associated with a higher prevalence of severe outcomes, although severe outcomes, including death, were observed in all age groups. Preliminary estimates of the prevalence of underlying health conditions among all patients with COVID-19 reported to CDC through March 2020 (9) suggested that 38% had at least one underlying condition, the same percentage found in this HCP patient population. Older HCP or those with underlying health conditions (8,9) should consider consulting with their health care provider and employee health program to better understand and manage their risks regarding COVID-19. The increased prevalence of severe outcomes in older HCP should be considered when mobilizing retired HCP to increase surge capacity, especially in the face of limited PPE availability§§; one consideration is preferential assignment of retired HCP to lower-risk settings (e.g., telemedicine, administrative assignments, or clinics for non–COVID-19 patients).

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, approximately 84% of patients were missing data on HCP status. Thus, the number of cases in HCP reported here must be considered a lower bound because additional cases likely have gone unidentified or unreported. Second, among cases reported in HCP, the amount of missing data varied across demographic groups, exposures, symptoms, underlying conditions, and health outcomes; cases with available information might differ systematically from those without available information. Therefore, additional data are needed to confirm findings about the impact of potentially important factors (e.g., disparities in race and ethnicity or underlying health conditions among HCP). Third, additional time will be necessary for full ascertainment of outcomes, such as hospitalization status or death. Fourth, details of occupation and health care setting were not routinely collected through case-based surveillance and, therefore, were unavailable for this analysis. Finally, among HCP patients who reported contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient in a health care setting, the nature of this contact, including whether it was with a patient, visitor, or other HCP, and the details of potential occupational exposures, including whether HCP were unprotected (i.e., without recommended PPE) or were present during high risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) are unknown (10).

It is critical to make every effort to ensure the health and safety of this essential national workforce of approximately 18 million HCP, both at work and in the community. Surveillance is necessary for monitoring the impact of COVID-19-associated illness and better informing the implementation of infection prevention and control measures. Improving surveillance through routine reporting of occupation and industry not only benefits HCP, but all workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.",4/16/20 0:00,
"Hospitalization Rates and Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized with Laboratory-Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 — COVID-NET, 14 States, March 1–30, 2020","Discussion

During March 1–28, 2020, the overall laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated hospitalization rate was 4.6 per 100,000 population; rates increased with age, with the highest rates among adults aged ≥65 years. Approximately 90% of hospitalized patients identified through COVID-NET had one or more underlying conditions, the most common being obesity, hypertension, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.

Using the existing infrastructure of two respiratory virus surveillance platforms, COVID-NET was implemented to produce robust, weekly, age-stratified hospitalization rates using standardized data collection methods. These data are being used, along with data from other surveillance platforms (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview.html), to monitor COVID-19 disease activity and severity in the United States. During the first month of surveillance, COVID-NET hospitalization rates ranged from 0.1 per 100,000 population in persons aged 5–17 years to 17.2 per 100,000 population in adults aged ≥85 years, whereas cumulative influenza hospitalization rates during the first 4 weeks of each influenza season (epidemiologic weeks 40–43) over the past 5 seasons have ranged from 0.1 in persons aged 5–17 years to 2.2–5.4 in adults aged ≥85 years (6). COVID-NET rates during this first 4-week period of surveillance are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution; given the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, rates are expected to increase as additional cases are identified and as SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity in the United States increases.

In the COVID-NET catchment population, approximately 49% of residents are male and 51% of residents are female, whereas 54% of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations occurred in males and 46% occurred in females. These data suggest that males may be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 compared with females. Similarly, in the COVID-NET catchment population, approximately 59% of residents are white, 18% are black, and 14% are Hispanic; however, among 580 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with race/ethnicity data, approximately 45% were white, 33% were black, and 8% were Hispanic, suggesting that black populations might be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. These findings, including the potential impact of both sex and race on COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates, need to be confirmed with additional data.

Most of the hospitalized patients had underlying conditions, some of which are recognized to be associated with severe COVID-19 disease, including chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus (5). COVID-NET does not collect data on nonhospitalized patients; thus, it was not possible to compare the prevalence of underlying conditions in hospitalized versus nonhospitalized patients. Many of the documented underlying conditions among hospitalized COVID-19 patients are highly prevalent in the United States. According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, hypertension prevalence among U.S. adults is 29% overall, ranging from 7.5%–63% across age groups (7), and age-adjusted obesity prevalence is 42% (range across age groups = 40%–43%) (8). Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, hypertension prevalence was 50% (range across age groups = 18%–73%), and obesity prevalence was 48% (range across age groups = 41%–59%). In addition, the prevalences of several underlying conditions identified through COVID-NET were similar to those for hospitalized influenza patients identified through FluSurv-NET during influenza seasons 2014–15 through 2018–19: 41%–51% of patients had cardiovascular disease (excluding hypertension), 39%–45% had chronic metabolic disease, 33%–40% had obesity, and 29%–31% had chronic lung disease (6). Data on hypertension are not collected by FluSurv-NET. Among women aged 15–49 years hospitalized with COVID-19 and identified through COVID-NET, 9% were pregnant, which is similar to an estimated 9.9% of the general population of women aged 15–44 years who are pregnant at any given time based on 2010 data.†† Similar to other reports from the United States (9) and China (1), these findings indicate that a high proportion of U.S. patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are older and have underlying medical conditions.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, hospitalization rates by age and COVID-NET site are preliminary and might change as additional cases are identified from this surveillance period. Second, whereas minimum case data to produce weekly age-stratified hospitalization rates are usually available within 7 days of case identification, availability of detailed clinical data are delayed because of the need for medical chart abstractions. As of March 30, chart abstractions had been conducted for approximately 200 COVID-19 patients; the frequency and distribution of underlying conditions during this time might change as additional data become available. Clinical course and outcomes will be presented once the number of cases with complete medical chart abstractions are sufficient; many patients are still hospitalized at the time of this report. Finally, testing for SARS-CoV-2 among patients identified through COVID-NET is performed at the discretion of treating health care providers, and testing practices and capabilities might vary widely across providers and facilities. As a result, underascertainment of cases in COVID-NET is likely. Additional data on testing practices related to SARS-CoV-2 will be collected in the future to account for underascertainment using described methods (10).

Early data from COVID-NET suggest that COVID-19–associated hospitalizations in the United States are highest among older adults, and nearly 90% of persons hospitalized have one or more underlying medical conditions. These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain) to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions. Ongoing monitoring of hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized patients will be important to better understand the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States and the clinical spectrum of disease, and to help guide planning and prioritization of health care system resources.",4/16/20 0:00,
What is coronavirus and Covid-19? An explainer,"""Novel coronavirus"" is the proper term for this brand-new virus wreaking havoc on our unprepared world.

But you can also call this nasty villain by its scientific name: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2 for short.

Becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 can trigger a potentially deadly respiratory disease called Covid-19, an illness which presents with three main acute symptoms: fever, a deep, dry cough and a shortness of breath which can become quickly life-threatening. Other symptoms can mimic a cold or the flu.

Covid-19 seems to strike the elderly and immunocompromised the hardest, along with any of us with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart and lung disease. But the young shouldn't take anything for granted -- there have been numerous deaths among people aged 20 to 50, as well as a very few among children.

Covid-19 can also present with mild symptoms very similar to a typical cold or flu -- or no symptoms at all, which makes controlling the spread of the virus causing Covid-19 very difficult.

What is a coronavirus?

All viruses are like zombies -- they try to take over people's bodies -- but they aren't really alive. Outside the host's body they are dormant, surviving without living. Once touched or inhaled and brought inside, their ancient machinery springs into action, using proteins to latch onto and invade human cells.

There they set up shop, producing millions of copies of themselves and causing those cells to rupture. Like the famous scene from the movie ""Alien,"" the viral offspring shoot out into the bloodstream, with the goal of invading more and more cells.

As they multiply, humans began to spit them out into the universe with each exhalation, making us contagious days before we begin to cough, sneeze or have diarrhea -- all symptoms the virus creates to ensure it can leap from human to human, thus ensuring its survival.

This ""virus zombie invasion"" comes in all sort of shapes, sizes and genetic strategies. All coronaviruses are covered with pointy spires of protein, giving them the appearance of having a crown or ""corona"" -- hence the name. Coronaviruses use these spikes to latch onto and pierce our cells.

Coronaviruses are part of the RNA brigade of viruses, which are much less stable than their DNA-based comrades. Why is that important? Because instability leads to mistakes in copying genetic code.

That leads to mutations -- thousands, millions, billions of mutations. Sooner or later, one mutation hits pay dirt and allows the virus to cross the great divide between different species. A few million/billion/trillion more mistakes creates another mutation that allows that virus to spread easily. Now the virus is both in its new host and it is contagious.

It's that type of mutation which gives humanity viruses like SARS-CoV-2.

Where did the novel coronavirus come from?

The animal kingdom is teeming with coronaviruses. They are found in cats and dogs, pigs and cattle, turkey and chickens, mice, rats, rabbits and of course, humans. Insects too.

Some of those coronviruses can cross species, such as between pigs, cats and dogs, but for the most part coronaviruses stay loyal to their original hosts. Until, of course, they become that lucky mutation.

""Usually viruses from one animal really don't effectively transmit to other animal species or even to people,"" said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

""So usually if a virus goes from an animal to a human, it's sort of dead end. That person gets sick but it doesn't spread further,"" said Williams, who has studied coronaviruses for decades.

Besides the newly hatched novel coronavirus, there are actually six additional coronaviruses that infect humans -- four of them cause the common cold.

Two more can be deadly. MERS-CoV is the villian behind Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, which has killed over 800 people worldwide since it first appeared in 2012.

SARS-CoV causes a serious form of pneumonia that can also be life-threatening. Globally, it killed 774 people between 2002 and 2004. No other cases have been reported worldwide since. {To put that into context, the death toll of the novel coronavirus since it burst on the scene in December is approaching 40,000).

The coronaviruses that cause MERS and SARS are though to have crossed from mammals to humans, where they mutated to become contagious. MERS-CoV first appeared in Jordon and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and it's thought to have crossed over to humans from dromedary camels in Africa, the Middle East and southern Asia.

""MERS is extremely deadly, about 30% of people who are infected with MERS will die,"" Williams said. ""So the virus got over one of the barriers -- it's able to infect humans, grow in them and cause disease -- but thankfully it really doesn't spread well person to person, other than very, very close contacts.""

SARS has been more difficult to pin down.

Because one of the most common carriers for coronaviruses are bats, it's thought that the virus may have started there. Then it supposedly mutated to the masked palm civet, a small cat-like mammal eaten in some parts of China. But even that theory is disputed

""SARS caused death in about 10% of people that became infected and it did spread person to person but not super effectively,"" Williams said. ""There weren't many people walking around without symptoms or with mild symptoms, who could be spreading it.

""This new virus, SARS-CoV-2, has overcome more barriers,"" Williams added. ""It spreads easily person to person and a lot of people can have either mild disease or they might not even have symptoms, yet they can have the virus and spread it.""

The novel coronavirus appears to have originated in bats. study published in February found the coronavirus found in bats shared 96% of the same genetic makeup as the novel coronavirus. But it wasn't a direct link, so the bat had to have infected another species, which then infected humans.

Early reports pointed to snakes bought at a ""wet market"" in China were people buy live animals to eat. A recent report of the initial cases of coronavirus in China debunks the ""snake flu"" theory, reporting that in 13 of the 41 early cases the infected patients had no link to the wet market.

A recent hypothesis claimed the intermediate host was the pangolin, an endangered scaly, ant-eating creature beloved for its meat and scales, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. But critics have been skeptical, sending genetic scientists back to their labs to continue the search.

At this time, scientists don't know where the novel coronavirus began.

""These things are more difficult than [identifying] dinosaurs, because there's no fossil record of a virus,"" Williams said. ""For example, the main virus I study, human metapneumovirus, is clearly a virus that has circulated in humans for decades if not a few centuries.

That's what we think. But it isn't impossible that a human virus jumped to birds and became established there.""",3/31/20 0:00,
COVID-19: Potential Implications for Individuals with Substance Use Disorders | National Institute on Drug Abuse,"Image Image by CDC/ Alissa Eckert, MS; Dan Higgins, MAMS This illustration, created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reveals ultrastructural morphology exhibited by coronaviruses. Note the spikes that adorn the outer surface of the virus, which impart the look of a corona surrounding the virion, when viewed electron microscopically. A novel coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China in 2019. The illness caused by this virus has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As people across the U.S. and the rest of the world contend with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the research community should be alert to the possibility that it could hit some populations with substance use disorders (SUDs) particularly hard. Because it attacks the lungs, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 could be an especially serious threat to those who smoke tobacco or marijuana or who vape. People with opioid use disorder (OUD) and methamphetamine use disorder may also be vulnerable due to those drugs’ effects on respiratory and pulmonary health. Additionally, individuals with a substance use disorder are more likely to experience homelessness or incarceration than those in the general population, and these circumstances pose unique challenges regarding transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. All these possibilities should be a focus of active surveillance as we work to understand this emerging health threat.

NIH has posted a compilation of updates for applicants and grantees, including a Guide Notice on administrative flexibilities and accompanying FAQs

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 is believed to have jumped species from other mammals (likely bats) to first infect humans in Wuhan, capital of China’s Hubei province, in late 2019. It attacks the respiratory tract and appears to have a higher fatality rate than seasonal influenza. The exact fatality rate is still unknown, since it depends on the number of undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases, and further analyses are needed to determine those figures. Thus far, deaths and serious illness from COVID-19 seem concentrated among those who are older and who have underlying health issues, such as diabetes, cancer, and respiratory conditions. It is therefore reasonable to be concerned that compromised lung function or lung disease related to smoking history, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), could put people at risk for serious complications of COVID-19.

Co-occurring conditions including COPD, cardiovascular disease, and other respiratory diseases have been found to worsen prognosis in patients with other coronaviruses that affect the respiratory system, such as those that cause SARS and MERS. According to a case series published in JAMA based on data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), the case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 was 6.3 percent for those with chronic respiratory disease, compared to a CFR of 2.3 percent overall. In China, 52.9 percent of men smoke, in contrast to just 2.4 percent of women; further analysis of the emerging COVID-19 data from China could help determine if this disparity is contributing to the higher mortality observed in men compared to women, as reported by China CDC. While data thus far are preliminary, they do highlight the need for further research to clarify the role of underlying illness and other factors in susceptibility to COVID-19 and its clinical course.

Vaping, like smoking, may also harm lung health. Whether it can lead to COPD is still unknown, but emerging evidence suggests that exposure to aerosols from e-cigarettes harms the cells of the lung and diminishes the ability to respond to infection. In one NIH-supported study, for instance, influenza virus-infected mice exposed to these aerosols had enhanced tissue damage and inflammation.

People who use opioids at high doses medically or who have OUD face separate challenges to their respiratory health. Since opioids act in the brainstem to slow breathing, their use not only puts the user at risk of life-threatening or fatal overdose, it may also cause a harmful decrease in oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia). Lack of oxygen can be especially damaging to the brain; while brain cells can withstand short periods of low oxygen, they can suffer damage when this state persists. Chronic respiratory disease is already known to increase overdose mortality risk among people taking opioids, and thus diminished lung capacity from COVID-19 could similarly endanger this population.

A history of methamphetamine use may also put people at risk. Methamphetamine constricts the blood vessels, which is one of the properties that contributes to pulmonary damage and pulmonary hypertension in people who use it. Clinicians should be prepared to monitor the possible adverse effects of methamphetamine use, the prevalence of which is increasing in our country, when treating those with COVID-19.

Other risks for people with substance use disorders include decreased access to health care, housing insecurity, and greater likelihood for incarceration. Limited access to health care places people with addiction at greater risk for many illnesses, but if hospitals and clinics are pushed to their capacity, it could be that people with addiction—who are already stigmatized and underserved by the healthcare system—will experience even greater barriers to treatment for COVID-19. Homelessness or incarceration can expose people to environments where they are in close contact with others who might also be at higher risk for infections. The prospect of self-quarantine and other public health measures may also disrupt access to syringe services, medications, and other support needed by people with OUD.

We know very little right now about COVID-19 and even less about its intersection with substance use disorders. But we can make educated guesses based on past experience that people with compromised health due to smoking or vaping and people with opioid, methamphetamine, cannabis, and other substance use disorders could find themselves at increased risk of COVID-19 and its more serious complications—for multiple physiological and social/environmental reasons. The research community should thus be alert to associations between COVID-19 case severity/mortality and substance use, smoking or vaping history, and smoking- or vaping-related lung disease. We must also ensure that patients with substance use disorders are not discriminated against if a rise in COVID-19 cases places added burden on our healthcare system.

As we strive to confront the major health challenges of opioid and other drug overdoses—and now the rising infections with COVID-19—NIDA encourages researchers to request supplements that will allow them to obtain data on the risks for COVID-19 in individuals experiencing substance use disorders.

San Francisco Issues New Policy on Face Coverings,"San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced that everyone in San Francisco will be required to wear face coverings when they are outside of their homes for essential needs, including waiting in line for or inside of a grocery store or on public transportation. Additionally, transportation workers and other employees who interact with the public must also cover their face while doing essential work. A full list of the requirements of the Health Order is listed below.

By strengthening this method of protection, San Franciscans will be less likely to transmit the coronavirus to one another. Face coverings help to stop droplets that may be infectious, even if the person wearing the mask has no or mild symptoms.

“Today’s Order is part of our broader strategy to protect public health and slow the spread of the coronavirus in our community,” said Mayor Breed. “By covering your face when you go pick up food or ride Muni, you are helping reduce the risk of infecting those around you. As we look to a time where we can begin to ease the Stay Home Order, we know that face coverings will be part of that future – and we want San Franciscans to become more comfortable with this new normal. We know it will take some time to get used to, but it will help save lives.”

The requirement is a Health Order by Dr. Tomás Aragón, Health Officer of the City and County of San Francisco. The Order is effective at 11:59 p.m. on April 17, 2020, but it will not be enforced until 8:00 a.m. on April 22, 2020. It is informed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Previously, the City recommended face coverings on April 2nd, and this order makes it a requirement.

“My mask protects you, and your mask protects me,” said Dr. Colfax. “Covering your face is a great way to show you care for your neighbors, friends and family. We are going to have to continue to work together to slow down the virus and reduce transmission. The virus is still out there, and we need to be vigilant.”

Wearing a face covering is not a substitute for staying home, staying 6 feet apart and frequent handwashing. These activities must be continued faithfully as part of the City’s coronavirus response.

Face coverings should cover the nose and mouth and fit securely. They can be a manufactured or homemade mask, a bandanna, scarf, towel, neck gaiter or similar item. Cloth face coverings should be cleaned frequently with soap and water.

Face coverings do not need to be N-95 or surgical masks to help prevent the spread of the virus to others. Please refrain from buying hospital-grade masks so that those are available for health care workers and first responders.

Compliance is not anticipated to be an issue, as the vast majority of San Franciscans have been adhering to the Stay Home Order and social distancing. Many people already are wearing face coverings outside. However, the order does carry the force of law, and noncompliance is a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.

Summary of the new requirements

For the public, face coverings will be required:

While inside or waiting in line to enter an essential businesses, like a grocery store or pharmacy.

When seeking health care.

When waiting for or riding transit.

When entering facilities allowed to operate under the Stay Home Order (such as government buildings.)

Businesses must:

Inform customers about the need to wear a face covering, including posting signs;

Take reasonable steps to keep people who are not wearing a face covering from entering their business, and

Refuse service to anyone not wearing a face covering.

For essential workers and transportation workers:

All workers and volunteers at essential businesses, operating public transportation, or operating other types of shared transportation must wear a face covering when at work in most settings, when interacting with the public or co-workers.

Workers doing minimum basic operations, like security or payroll, essential infrastructure work, or government functions must wear a face covering when others are nearby or when they are in areas that the public regularly visits.

Face coverings are not required to be worn when by people who are:

At home.

In their cars alone or with members of their household.

Outdoors, walking, hiking, bicycling, or running. However, people are recommended to have a face covering with them and readily accessible when exercising, even if they’re not wearing it at that moment.

Children 12 years old or younger. Children age 2 and under must not wear a face covering due to the risk of suffocation. Children age 3 to 12 are not required to wear a face covering, but if they do, they should be supervised by an adult.

San Francisco Issues New Public Health Order Requiring Residents Stay at Home Except for Essential Needs,"Restaurants limited to take-out and delivery only; bars, gyms, and non-essential stores to close

San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced that the Health Officer of the City and County of San Francisco has issued a Public Health Order requiring that residents remain in place, with the only exception being for essential needs. This measure is necessary to slow the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the community. The Order is effective as of midnight on Tuesday, March 17th and is effective until April 7th, 2020, or until it is extended.

“We know these measures will significantly disrupt people’s day to day lives, but they are absolutely necessary,” said Mayor Breed. “This is going to be a defining moment for our City and we all have a responsibility to do our part to protect our neighbors and slow the spread of this virus by staying at home unless it is absolutely essential to go outside. I want to encourage everyone to remain calm and emphasize that all essential needs will continue to be met. San Francisco has overcome big challenges before and we will do it again, together.”

The Order directs all residents to remain at their place of residence, except to conduct Essential Activities , Essential Businesses , and Essential Government Functions (defined below). When conducting an allowed activity, people must maintain at least 6 feet of social distancing from everyone other than household members.

All businesses, other than Essential Businesses and Essential Government Functions, are required to cease all operations. All public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a single family or living unit are prohibited, except for the exemptions listed below.

All travel, including but not limited to walking, biking, driving, or taking public transit is prohibited, except to perform Essential Activities, operate Essential Businesses, or to maintain Essential Government Functions. Individuals may go on a walk, get exercise, or take a pet outside to go to the bathroom, as long as at least six feet of social distancing is maintained. People riding on public transit must maintain at least six feet of social distancing from other passengers.

Homeless individuals are not subject to the shelter in place order but are encouraged to seek shelter, and the City will be working with the State, following up on the Governor’s announcement yesterday, to maximize available resources for the homeless population.

Essential Activities (exemptions to the shelter in place order) include :

Tasks essential to maintain health and safety, such as obtaining medicine or seeing a doctor;

Getting necessary services or supplies for themselves or their family or household members, such as getting food and supplies, pet food, and getting supplies necessary for staying at home;

Roles required for any Essential Business to “maintain basic operations,” which include security, payroll, and similar activities.



Perform an Essential Government Function:

This includes all services needed to ensure the continuing operation of the government agencies and provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public.

“As the coronavirus situation continues to change rapidly in our city and region, I want to make sure that all San Franciscans understand that we are entering a new phase in our response. Our response has been grounded in data, science, and facts,” said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. “Based on what we can predict, now is the time to do everything we can to prevent the situation from getting much worse in a matter of days or weeks. Every hour counts. We need and appreciate the cooperation of everyone who lives and works in San Francisco—and across the Bay Area—to act immediately.”

The Department of Public Health urges people not to rush to urgent care or emergency rooms for COVID-19 testing or non-emergency needs. Do not overwhelm the health system or the emergency response system at this time. We need it to care for those who are seriously ill. If you are otherwise sick or concerned you may have coronavirus, contact your health care provider.

The Department of Public Health has issued aggressive recommendations to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community. The recommendations for social distancing are intended to disrupt the spread of the virus and protect community health. These are systemic as well as individual changes that will make a difference in people’s lives. Although the recommendations cause inconvenience, they are necessary and worthwhile to reduce the spread of the virus and interrupt its transmission from person to person.

Public Health Orders and recommendations from DPH can be found at sfdph.org/dph/alerts/coronavirus.asp. Mayoral Declarations regarding COVID-19 can be found at sfmayor.org/mayoral-declarations-regarding-covid-19. You can also call 311 and sign up for the City’s alert service for official updates: text COVID19SF to 888-777.

Remember, these are the best ways for all San Franciscans to reduce their risk of getting sick, and preventing COVID-19:

Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze.

Stay home if you are sick.

Avoid touching your face.

Try alternatives to shaking hands, like a wave.

If you have recently returned from a country, state or region with ongoing COVID-19 infections, monitor your health and follow the instructions of public health officials.

There is no recommendation to wear masks at this time to prevent yourself from getting sick.

You can also prepare for the possible disruption caused by an outbreak:

Prepare to work from home if that is possible for your job, and your employer.

Make sure you have a supply of all essential medications for your family.

Prepare a child care plan if you or a caregiver are sick.

Make arrangements about how your family will manage school closures.

Plan for how you can care for a sick family member without getting sick yourself.

Take care of each other and check in by phone with friends, family and neighbors that are vulnerable to serious illness or death if they get COVID-19.

Keep common spaces clean to help maintain a healthy environment for you and others. Frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned regularly with disinfecting sprays, wipes or common household cleaning products.

"Severe Outcomes Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) — United States, February 12–March 16, 2020","On March 18, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

COVID-19 can result in severe disease, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, and death, especially among older adults. Everyone can take actions, such as social distancing, to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults from severe illness.

This first preliminary description of outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in the United States indicates that fatality was highest in persons aged ≥85, ranging from 10% to 27%, followed by 3% to 11% among persons aged 65–84 years, 1% to 3% among persons aged 55-64 years, <1% among persons aged 20–54 years, and no fatalities among persons aged ≤19 years.

Globally, approximately 170,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, including an estimated 7,000 deaths in approximately 150 countries (1). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness and death than are younger persons (3). Although the majority of reported COVID-19 cases in China were mild (81%), approximately 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged ≥60 years; only one (0.1%) death occurred in a person aged ≤19 years (3). In this report, COVID-19 cases in the United States that occurred during February 12–March 16, 2020 and severity of disease (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], and death) were analyzed by age group. As of March 16, a total of 4,226 COVID-19 cases in the United States had been reported to CDC, with multiple cases reported among older adults living in long-term care facilities (4). Overall, 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths associated with COVID-19 were among adults aged ≥65 years with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged ≥85 years. In contrast, no ICU admissions or deaths were reported among persons aged ≤19 years. Similar to reports from other countries, this finding suggests that the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in older age groups.

Data from cases reported from 49 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories (5) to CDC during February 12–March 16 were analyzed. Cases among persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and from Japan (including patients repatriated from cruise ships) were excluded. States and jurisdictions voluntarily reported data on laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 using previously developed data collection forms (6). The cases described in this report include both COVID-19 cases confirmed by state or local public health laboratories as well as those with a positive test at the state or local public health laboratories and confirmation at CDC. No data on serious underlying health conditions were available. Data on these cases are preliminary and are missing for some key characteristics of interest, including hospitalization status (1,514), ICU admission (2,253), death (2,001), and age (386). Because of these missing data, the percentages of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths (case-fatality percentages) were estimated as a range. The lower bound of these percentages was estimated by using all cases within each age group as denominators. The corresponding upper bound of these percentages was estimated by using only cases with known information on each outcome as denominators.

As of March 16, a total of 4,226 COVID-19 cases had been reported in the United States, with reports increasing to 500 or more cases per day beginning March 14 (Figure 1). Among 2,449 patients with known age, 6% were aged ≥85, 25% were aged 65–84 years, 18% each were aged 55–64 years and 45–54 years, and 29% were aged 20–44 years (Figure 2). Only 5% of cases occurred in persons aged 0–19 years.

Among 508 (12%) patients known to have been hospitalized, 9% were aged ≥85 years, start highlight36%end highlight were aged 65–84 years, 17% were aged 55–64 years, 18% were 45–54 years, and 20% were aged 20–44 years. Less than 1% of hospitalizations were among persons aged ≤19 years (Figure 2). The percentage of persons hospitalized increased with age, from 2%–3% among persons aged start highlight≤19end highlight years, to ≥31% among adults aged ≥85 years. (Table).

Among 121 patients known to have been admitted to an ICU, 7% of cases were reported among adults ≥85 years, 46% among adults aged 65–84 years, 36% among adults aged 45–64 years, and 12% among adults aged 20–44 years (Figure 2). No ICU admissions were reported among persons aged ≤19 years. Percentages of ICU admissions were lowest among adults aged 20–44 years (2%–4%) and highest among adults aged 75–84 years (11%–31%) (Table).

Among 44 cases with known outcome, 15 (34%) deaths were reported among adults aged ≥85 years, 20 (46%) among adults aged 65–84 years, and nine (20%) among adults aged 20–64 years. Case-fatality percentages increased with increasing age, from no deaths reported among persons aged ≤19 years to highest percentages (10%–27%) among adults aged ≥85 years (Table) (Figure 2).",3/26/20 0:00,
"Community Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at Two Family Gatherings — Chicago, Illinois, February–March 2020","On April 8, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

Investigation of COVID-19 cases in Chicago identified a cluster of 16 confirmed or probable cases, including three deaths, likely resulting from one introduction. Extended family gatherings including a funeral and a birthday party likely facilitated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in this cluster.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the world since it was first recognized in late 2019. Most early reports of person-to-person SARS-CoV-2 transmission have been among household contacts, where the secondary attack rate has been estimated to exceed 10% (1), in health care facilities (2), and in congregate settings (3). However, widespread community transmission, as is currently being observed in the United States, requires more expansive transmission events between nonhousehold contacts. In February and March 2020, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) investigated a large, multifamily cluster of COVID-19. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 and their close contacts were interviewed to better understand nonhousehold, community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This report describes the cluster of 16 cases of confirmed or probable COVID-19, including three deaths, likely resulting from transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at two family gatherings (a funeral and a birthday party). These data support current CDC social distancing recommendations intended to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. U.S residents should follow stay-at-home orders when required by state or local authorities.

During January 1–March 20, 2020, specimens that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at hospital, commercial, or public health laboratories were reported to CDPH; each triggered an epidemiologic investigation. Contact tracing interviews were conducted with patients with confirmed COVID-19 using a structured questionnaire designed to identify the date of symptom onset and any person with whom the patient had close contact since that date. The type of contact and setting in which the contact occurred were recorded. Close contacts of patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19 were interviewed and enrolled in active symptom monitoring using Research Electronic Data Capture software (REDCap, version 8.8.0, Vanderbilt University, 2020). Patients were classified as having confirmed COVID-19 if SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen. Patients were classified as having probable COVID-19 if they developed new symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath within 14 days of contact with a patient with confirmed or probable COVID-19 but did not undergo laboratory testing (consistent with CDC recommendations,* the Illinois Department of Public Health prioritizes testing for hospitalized patients and other high-risk groups).

In February 2020, a funeral was held for a decedent with a non-COVID-19, nonrespiratory cause of death. A close friend of the bereaved family (patient A1.1) attended the funeral; patients in this investigation were referred to by their family cluster letter (A or B), then by the assumed transmission generation (1–4), and finally, in sequence order within each generation (1–7)† (Figure 1). Patient A1.1 had recently traveled out of state and was experiencing mild respiratory symptoms; he was only tested later as part of the epidemiologic investigation and received a diagnosis of confirmed COVID-19. The evening before the funeral (investigation day 1), patient A1.1 shared a takeout meal, eaten from common serving dishes, with two family members of the decedent (patients B2.1 and B2.2) at their home. At the meal, which lasted approximately 3 hours, and the funeral, which lasted about 2 hours and involved a shared “potluck-style” meal, patient A1.1 also reported embracing family members of the decedent, including patients B2.1, B2.2, B2.3, and B3.1, to express condolences.

Patients B2.1 and B2.2 subsequently developed confirmed COVID-19 with onset of symptoms 2 and 4 days, respectively, after the funeral; patient B2.3 developed probable COVID-19 with symptom onset 6 days after the funeral (investigation day 8). Patient B2.1 was hospitalized on investigation day 11, required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for acute repiratory failure, and died on investigation day 28. Patients B2.2 and B2.3 were managed as outpatients, and both recovered.

During investigation days 11–14, another family member who had close physical contact with patient A1.1 at the funeral (patient B3.1) visited patient B2.1 on the acute medical inpatient ward, embraced patient B2.1, and provided limited personal care, while wearing no personal protective equipment (PPE). Patient B3.1 developed signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, including a fever and cough on investigation day 17, 3 days after last visiting B2.1. Patient B3.1 had also attended the funeral 15 days before symptom onset but described more extensive exposure while visiting patient B2.1 in the hospital.

Three days after the funeral, on investigation day 5, patient A1.1, who was still experiencing mild respiratory symptoms, attended a birthday party attended by nine other family members, hosted in the home of patient A2.1. Close contact between patient A1.1 and all other attendees occurred; patient A1.1 embraced others and shared food at the 3-hour party. Seven party attendees subsequently developed COVID-19 3–7 days after the event (Figure 2), including three with confirmed cases (patients A2.1, A2.2, and A2.3) and four with probable cases (patients A2.4, A2.5, A2.6, and A2.7). Two patients with confirmed COVID-19 (A2.1 and A2.2) were hospitalized; both required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, and both died. One patient with a confirmed case (A2.3) experienced mild symptoms of cough and subjective low-grade fever, as did the four others who received diagnoses of probable COVID-19. Two attendees did not develop symptoms within 14 days of the birthday party.

Two persons who provided personal care for patient A2.1 without using PPE, including one family member (patient A3.1) and a home care professional (patient C3.1), both developed probable COVID-19. It is likely that patient A3.1 subsequently transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to a household contact (patient A4.1), who did not attend the birthday party, but developed a new onset cough 3 days following unprotected, close contact with patient A3.1 while patient A3.1 was symptomatic.

Three symptomatic birthday party attendees with probable COVID-19 (patients A2.5, A2.6, and A2.7) attended church 6 days after developing their first symptoms (investigation day 17). Another church attendee (patient D3.1, a health care professional) developed confirmed COVID-19 following close contact with patients A2.5, A2.6, and A2.7, including direct conversations, sitting within one row for 90 minutes, and passing the offering plate.

The patients described in this report ranged in age from 5 to 86 years. The three patients who died (patients A2.1, B2.1 and A2.2) were aged >60 years, and all had at least one underlying cardiovascular or respiratory medical condition.",4/16/20 0:00,
Confirmation of COVID-19 in Two Pet Cats in New York,"Washington, D.C. April 22, 2020 – The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) today announced the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection in two pet cats. These are the first pets in the United States to test positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The cats live in two separate areas of New York state. Both had mild respiratory illness and are expected to make a full recovery. SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in very few animals worldwide, mostly in those that had close contact with a person with COVID-19.

At this time, routine testing of animals is not recommended. Should other animals be confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, USDA will post the findingsexternal icon. State animal health and public health officials will take the lead in making determinations about whether animals should be tested for SARS-CoV-2.

In the NY cases announced today, a veterinarian tested the first cat after it showed mild respiratory signs. No individuals in the household were confirmed to be ill with COVID-19. The virus may have been transmitted to this cat by mildly ill or asymptomatic household members or through contact with an infected person outside its home.

Samples from the second cat were taken after it showed signs of respiratory illness. The owner of the cat tested positive for COVID-19 prior to the cat showing signs. Another cat in the household has shown no signs of illness.

Both cats tested presumptive positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a private veterinary laboratory, which then reported the results to state and federal officials. The confirmatory testing was conducted at NVSL and included collection of additional samples. NVSL serves as an international reference laboratory and provides expertise and guidance on diagnostic techniques, as well as confirmatory testing for foreign and emerging animal diseases. Such testing is required for certain animal diseases in the U.S. in order to comply with national and international reporting procedures. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) considers SARS-CoV-2 an emerging disease, and therefore USDA must report confirmed U.S. animal infections to the OIE.

Public health officials are still learning about SARS-CoV-2, but there is no evidence that pets play a role in spreading the virus in the United States. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals that may compromise their welfare. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including pets, could be affected.

Until we know more, CDC recommends the following:

Do not let pets interact with people or other animals outside the household.

Keep cats indoors when possible to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.

Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet from other people and animals.

Avoid dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.

If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed by a test), restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would around other people.

When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.

Avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.

If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with them.

While additional animals may test positive as infections continue in people, it is important to note that performing this animal testing does not reduce the availability of tests for humans. The U.S. government remains committed to increasing nationwide COVID-19 testing for Americans. In fact, the United States has conducted more than four million COVID-19 tests for humans, which is more tests than the following nations combined: France, the UK, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada.

"""Immunity passports"" in the context of COVID-19","WHO has published guidance on adjusting public health and social measures for the next phase of the COVID-19 response.1 Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis for an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate” that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection. There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.

The measurement of antibodies specific to COVID-19

The development of immunity to a pathogen through natural infection is a multi-step process that typically takes place over 1-2 weeks. The body responds to a viral infection immediately with a non-specific innate response in which macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells slow the progress of virus and may even prevent it from causing symptoms. This non-specific response is followed by an adaptive response where the body makes antibodies that specifically bind to the virus. These antibodies are proteins called immunoglobulins. The body also makes T-cells that recognize and eliminate other cells infected with the virus. This is called cellular immunity. This combined adaptive response may clear the virus from the body, and if the response is strong enough, may prevent progression to severe illness or re-infection by the same virus. This process is often measured by the presence of antibodies in blood.

WHO continues to review the evidence on antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.2-17 Most of these studies show that people who have recovered from infection have antibodies to the virus. However, some of these people have very low levels of neutralizing antibodies in their blood,4 suggesting that cellular immunity may also be critical for recovery. As of 24 April 2020, no study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans.

Laboratory tests that detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in people, including rapid immunodiagnostic tests, need further validation to determine their accuracy and reliability. Inaccurate immunodiagnostic tests may falsely categorize people in two ways. The first is that they may falsely label people who have been infected as negative, and the second is that people who have not been infected are falsely labelled as positive. Both errors have serious consequences and will affect control efforts. These tests also need to accurately distinguish between past infections from SARS-CoV-2 and those caused by the known set of six human coronaviruses. Four of these viruses cause the common cold and circulate widely. The remaining two are the viruses that cause Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. People infected by any one of these viruses may produce antibodies that cross-react with antibodies produced in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Many countries are now testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the population level or in specific groups, such as health workers, close contacts of known cases, or within households.21 WHO supports these studies, as they are critical for understanding the extent of – and risk factors associated with – infection. These studies will provide data on the percentage of people with detectable COVID-19 antibodies, but most are not designed to determine whether those people are immune to secondary infections.

Other considerations

At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate.” People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice. The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission. As new evidence becomes available, WHO will update this scientific brief.

Advice on the use of point-of-care immunodiagnostic tests for COVID-19,"In response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic and shortages of laboratory-based molecular testing capacity and reagents, multiple diagnostic test manufacturers have developed and begun selling rapid and easy-to-use devices to facilitate testing outside of laboratory settings. These simple test kits are based either on detection of proteins from the COVID-19 virus in respiratory samples (e.g. sputum, throat swab) or detection, in blood or serum, of human antibodies generated in response to infection.



WHO applauds the efforts of test developers to innovate and respond to the needs of the population.



However, before these tests can be recommended, they must be validated in the appropriate populations and settings. Inadequate tests may miss patients with active infection or falsely categorize patients as having the disease when they do not, further hampering disease control efforts. At present, based on current evidence, WHO recommends the use of these new point-of-care immunodiagnostic tests only in research settings. They should not be used in any other setting, including for clinical decision-making, until evidence supporting use for specific indications is available.



WHO continues to evaluate available immunodiagnostics tests for COVID-19 and will update this scientific brief when necessary.



Rapid diagnostic tests based on antigen detection

One type of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) detects the presence of viral proteins (antigens) expressed by the COVID-19 virus in a sample from the respiratory tract of a person. If the target antigen is present in sufficient concentrations in the sample, it will bind to specific antibodies fixed to a paper strip enclosed in a plastic casing and generate a visually detectable signal, typically within 30 minutes. The antigen(s) detected are expressed only when the virus is actively replicating; therefore, such tests are best used to identify acute or early infection.

How well the tests work depends on several factors, including the time from onset of illness, the concentration of virus in the specimen, the quality of the specimen collected from a person and how it is processed, and the precise formulation of the reagents in the test kits. Based on experience with antigen-based RDTs for other respiratory diseases such as influenza, in which affected patients have comparable concentrations of influenza virus in respiratory samples as seen in COVID-19, the sensitivity of these tests might be expected to vary from 34% to 80%.1

Based on this information, half or more of COVID-19 infected patients might be missed by such tests, depending on the group of patients tested. These assumptions urgently require further study to understand whether they are accurate. Additionally, false-positive results – that is, a test showing that a person is infected when they are not – could occur if the antibodies on the test strip also recognize antigens of viruses other than COVID-19, such as from human coronaviruses that cause the common cold. If any of the antigen detection tests that are under development or commercialized demonstrate adequate performance, they could potentially be used as triage tests to rapidly identify patients who are very likely to have COVID-19, reducing or eliminating the need for expensive molecular confirmatory testing.

With the limited data now available, WHO does not currently recommend the use of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for patient care, although research into their performance and potential diagnostic utility is highly encouraged.



Rapid diagnostic tests based on host antibody detection

There is another, more common type of rapid diagnostic test marketed for COVID-19; a test that detects the presence of antibodies in the blood of people believed to have been infected with COVID-19.2-5 Antibodies are produced over days to weeks after infection with the virus. The strength of antibody response depends on several factors, including age, nutritional status, severity of disease, and certain medications or infections like HIV that suppress the immune system.6-8 In some people with COVID-19, disease confirmed by molecular testing (e.g. reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction: RT-PCR), weak, late or absent antibody responses have been reported.6,7,9 Studies suggest that the majority of patients develop antibody response only in the second week after onset of symptoms.2,6,7,10-14 This means that a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection based on antibody response will often only be possible in the recovery phase, when many of the opportunities for clinical intervention or interruption of disease transmission have already passed. Antibody detection tests targeting COVID-19 may also cross-react with other pathogens, including other human coronaviruses.7,15,16 and give false-positive results. Lastly, there has been discussion about whether RDTs detecting antibodies could predict whether an individual was immune to reinfection with the COVID-19 virus. There is no evidence to date to support this.



Tests to detect antibody responses to COVID-19 in the population will be critical to support the development of vaccines, and to add to our understanding of the extent of infection among people who are not identified through active case finding and surveillance efforts, the attack rate in the population, and the infection fatality rate. For clinical diagnosis, however, such tests have limited utility because they cannot quickly diagnose acute infection to inform actions needed to determine the course of treatment. Some clinicians have used these tests for antibody responses to make a presumptive diagnosis of recent COVID-19 disease in cases where molecular testing was negative but where there was a strong epidemiological link to COVID-19 infection and paired blood samples (acute and convalescent) showing rising antibody levels.



Based on current data, WHO does not recommend the use of antibody-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for patient care but encourages the continuation of work to establish their usefulness in disease surveillance and epidemiologic research.

Next steps



Molecular (e.g. PCR) testing of respiratory tract samples is the recommended method for the identification and laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 molecular diagnostic products are being evaluated for quality and safety through the WHO Prequalification Emergency Use Listing Procedures and through a collaboration with the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND). WHO guidance documents for detection of COVID-19 have been published: WHO Guidance on Laboratory testing for COVID-19 in suspected human cases. In addition, guidance on how testing might be rationalized when lack of reagents or testing capacity necessitates prioritization of certain populations or individuals for testing is also available.



To inform WHO policy on the use of immunodiagnostic rapid tests for COVID-19, WHO is working with our global laboratory expert network, and closely reviewing the results of laboratory and clinical studies planned and implemented by reference laboratories, academic groups and non-governmental organizations.



Target product profiles for desired COVID-19 diagnostics to inform research and development efforts are in development.



WHO will continue to work with research groups, other agencies, and Member States to develop and interpret data that might indicate specific areas where such tests can be useful for clinical management of cases, epidemiologic understanding, and/or infection control.

NIAID

A new study has begun recruiting at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, to determine how many adults in the United States without a confirmed history of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have antibodies to the virus. The presence of antibodies in the blood indicates a prior infection. In this “serosurvey,” researchers will collect and analyze blood samples from as many as 10,000 volunteers to provide critical data for epidemiological models. The results will help illuminate the extent to which the novel coronavirus has spread undetected in the United States and provide insights into which communities and populations are most affected.

The study will be conducted by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), with additional support from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), all parts of NIH.

“This study will give us a clearer picture of the true magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States by telling us how many people in different communities have been infected without knowing it, because they had a very mild, undocumented illness or did not access testing while they were sick,” said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., NIAID director. “These crucial data will help us measure the impact of our public health efforts now and guide our COVID-19 response moving forward.”

Investigators will test participants’ blood samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies , proteins the immune system produces to fight a specific infectious agent. A positive test result indicates previous infection. To date, reporting of U.S. cases of COVID-19 has mostly relied on molecular tests that determine the presence of the virus in a person’s airways using a noninvasive cotton swab. While these cotton swab-based tests rapidly and effectively identify active infection, they do not determine whether a person was previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and recovered.

“An antibody test is looking back into the immune system’s history with a rearview mirror,” said Matthew J. Memoli, M.D., M.S., principal investigator of the study and director of NIAID’s Laboratory of Infectious Diseases Clinical Studies Unit. “By analyzing an individual’s blood, we can determine if that person has encountered SARS-CoV-2 previously.”

Investigators will analyze blood samples for two types of antibodies, anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG and IgM, using an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) developed by researchers at NIAID and NIBIB. In blood samples found to contain antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, researchers may perform additional tests to evaluate the volunteers’ immune responses to the virus. These data may provide insight as to why these cases were less severe than those that lead to hospitalization.

NIBIB

Healthy volunteers over the age of 18 from anywhere in the United States can participate and will be asked to consent to enrollment over the telephone. Individuals with a confirmed history of COVID-19 or current symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are not eligible to participate.

After enrollment, study participants will attend a virtual clinic visit, complete a health assessment questionnaire and provide basic demographic information—including race, ethnicity, sex, age and occupation—before submitting samples in one of two ways. Participants working at the NIH Bethesda campus will have blood drawn at the NIH Clinical Center. Other volunteers will participate in at-home blood sampling. Neoteryx, a medical device firm based in Torrance, California, will supply at-home blood collection kits. Researchers will ship each study participant a Mitra®Home Blood Collection Kit and provide detailed instructions on collecting a microsample of blood and mailing it back for future analysis in the laboratory.

“Researchers have considerable experience using these at-home blood collection kits to track the spread of other infectious diseases like influenza, and this method is safe, effective and easy-to-use,” said Kaitlyn Sadtler, Ph.D., study lead for laboratory testing and chief of NIBIB’s Section for Immunoengineering. “With a small finger-pick, volunteers can help scientists fight COVID-19 from their homes.”

New coronavirus stable for hours on surfaces,"New coronavirus stable for hours on surfaces

SARS-CoV-2 stability similar to original SARS virus.

NIAID-RML

What

The virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is stable for several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces, according to a new study from National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton University scientists in The New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists found that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The results provide key information about the stability of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, and suggests that people may acquire the virus through the air and after touching contaminated objects. The study information was widely shared during the past two weeks after the researchers placed the contents on a preprint server to quickly share their data with colleagues.

The NIH scientists, from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Montana facility at Rocky Mountain Laboratories, compared how the environment affects SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, which causes SARS. SARS-CoV-1, like its successor now circulating across the globe, emerged from China and infected more than 8,000 people in 2002 and 2003. SARS-CoV-1 was eradicated by intensive contact tracing and case isolation measures and no cases have been detected since 2004. SARS-CoV-1 is the human coronavirus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2. In the stability study the two viruses behaved similarly, which unfortunately fails to explain why COVID-19 has become a much larger outbreak.

The NIH study attempted to mimic virus being deposited from an infected person onto everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting, such as through coughing or touching objects. The scientists then investigated how long the virus remained infectious on these surfaces.

The scientists highlighted additional observations from their study:

If the viability of the two coronaviruses is similar, why is SARS-CoV-2 resulting in more cases? Emerging evidence suggests that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 might be spreading virus without recognizing, or prior to recognizing, symptoms. This would make disease control measures that were effective against SARS-CoV-1 less effective against its successor.

In contrast to SARS-CoV-1, most secondary cases of virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be occurring in community settings rather than healthcare settings. However, healthcare settings are also vulnerable to the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces likely contributes to transmission of the virus in healthcare settings.

The findings affirm the guidance from public health professionals to use precautions similar to those for influenza and other respiratory viruses to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

"Best Practices for Retail Food Stores, Restaurants, and Food Pick-Up/Delivery Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic","FDA is sharing information about best practices to operate retail food stores, restaurants, and associated pick-up and delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic to safeguard workers and consumers.

This addresses key considerations for how foods offered at retail can be safely handled and delivered to the public, as well as key best practices for employee health, cleaning and sanitizing, and personal protective equipment (PPE). This is not a comprehensive list. We encourage consulting the references and links provided below by CDC, FDA, EPA, and OSHA for more detailed information. This will be updated as FDA receives further information and inquiries.

On April 10, 2020, FDA held a call with industry members to discuss these best practices. Listen to a recording of the call (5MB, MP3) or download the transcript (66KB, PDF).

For additional resources, see Food Safety and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Personal Hygiene for Employees

Emphasize effective hand hygiene including washing hands for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

Always wash hands with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and avoid working with unwrapped or exposed foods.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Use gloves to avoid direct bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods.

Before preparing or eating food, always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash hands after.

Managing Operations in a Foodservice Establishment or Retail Food Store Continue to follow established food safety protocols and best practices for retail food establishments and important COVID-19 recommendations, including the following: Follow the 4 key steps to food safety: Always — Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill.

Wash, rinse, and sanitize food contact surfaces dishware, utensils, food preparation surfaces, and beverage equipment after use.

Frequently disinfect surfaces repeatedly touched by employees or customers such as door knobs, equipment handles, check-out counters, and grocery cart handles, etc.

Frequently clean and disinfect floors, counters, and other facility access areas using EPA-registered disinfectants.

Prepare and use sanitizers according to label instructions.

When changing your normal food preparation procedures, service, delivery functions, or making staffing changes, apply procedures that ensure: Cooked foods reach the proper internal temperatures prior to service or cooling. Hot foods are cooled rapidly for later use – check temperatures of foods being cooled in refrigerators or by rapid cooling techniques such as ice baths and cooling wands. The time foods being stored, displayed, or delivered are held in the danger zone (between 41°F and 135°F) is minimized. Proper training for food employees with new or altered duties and that they apply the training according to established procedures.

Help customers maintain good infection control and social distancing by: Discontinuing operations, such as salad bars, buffets, and beverage service stations that require customers to use common utensils or dispensers. Finding ways to encourage spacing between customers while in line for service or check out in accordance with the applicable State or local requirements. Discouraging customers from bringing pets — except service animals — into stores or waiting areas.

Continue to use sanitizers and disinfectants for their designed purposes.

Verify that your ware-washing machines are operating at the required wash and rinse temperatures and with the appropriate detergents and sanitizers.

Remember that hot water can be used in place of chemicals to sanitize equipment and utensils in manual ware-washing machines.

If you donate food to food recovery or charitable organizations, check for State and local guidelines. You can also find further information at Conference for Food Protection. Managing Food Pick-Up and Delivery

Observe established food safety practices for time/temp control, preventing cross contamination, cleaning hands, no sick workers, and storage of food, etc.

Have employees wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing, or after touching high touch surfaces, e.g., doorknobs, and doorbells. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. See, CDC’s How to Protect Yourself & Others.

Increase the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces such as counter tops and touch pads and within the vehicle, by wiping down surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Make sure to read the label and follow manufacturer’s instructions on use.

Establish designated pick-up zones for customers to help maintain social distancing.

Practice social distancing when delivering food, e.g., offering “no touch” deliveries and sending text alerts or calling when deliveries have arrived.

Conduct an evaluation of your facility to identify and apply operational changes in order to maintain social distancing if offering take-out/carry-out option by maintaining a 6-foot distance from others, when possible.

Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold by storing in appropriate transport vessels. Keep cold foods cold by keeping enough coolant materials, e.g., gel packs. Keep hot foods hot by ensuring insulated cases are properly functioning.

Keep foods separated to avoid cross contamination, e.g., keeping raw foods separated from cooked and ready-to-eat foods.

Ensure that any wrapping and packaging used for food transport is done so that contamination of the food is prevented.

Routinely clean and sanitize coolers and insulated bags used to deliver foods.

"Why do some COVID-19 patients infect many others, whereas most don’t spread the virus at all?","Why do some COVID-19 patients infect many others, whereas most don’t spread the virus at all?

Science ’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Pulitzer Center.

When 61 people met for a choir practice in a church in Mount Vernon, Washington, on 10 March, everything seemed normal. For 2.5 hours the chorists sang, snacked on cookies and oranges, and sang some more. But one of them had been suffering for 3 days from what felt like a cold—and turned out to be COVID-19. In the following weeks, 53 choir members got sick, three were hospitalized, and two died, according to a 12 May report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that meticulously reconstructed the tragedy.

Many similar “superspreading events” have occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic. A database by Gwenan Knight and colleagues at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) lists an outbreak in a dormitory for migrant workers in Singapore linked to almost 800 cases; 80 infections tied to live music venues in Osaka, Japan; and a cluster of 65 cases resulting from Zumba classes in South Korea. Clusters have also occurred aboard ships and at nursing homes, meatpacking plants, ski resorts, churches, restaurants, hospitals, and prisons. Sometimes a single person infects dozens of people, whereas other clusters unfold across several generations of spread, in multiple venues.

Other infectious diseases also spread in clusters, and with close to 5 million reported COVID-19 cases worldwide, some big outbreaks were to be expected. But SARS-CoV-2, like two of its cousins, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), seems especially prone to attacking groups of tightly connected people while sparing others. It’s an encouraging finding, scientists say, because it suggests that restricting gatherings where superspreading is likely to occur will have a major impact on transmission, and that other restrictions—on outdoor activity, for example—might be eased.

“If you can predict what circumstances are giving rise to these events, the math shows you can really, very quickly curtail the ability of the disease to spread,” says Jamie Lloyd-Smith of the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied the spread of many pathogens. But superspreading events are ill-understood and difficult to study, and the findings can lead to heartbreak and fear of stigma in patients who touch them off.

Most of the discussion around the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has concentrated on the average number of new infections caused by each patient. Without social distancing, this reproduction number (R) is about three. But in real life, some people infect many others and others don’t spread the disease at all. In fact, the latter is the norm, Lloyd-Smith says: “The consistent pattern is that the most common number is zero. Most people do not transmit.”

That’s why in addition to R, scientists use a value called the dispersion factor (k), which describes how much a disease clusters. The lower k is, the more transmission comes from a small number of people. In a seminal 2005 Nature paper, Lloyd-Smith and co-authors estimated that SARS—in which superspreading played a major role—had a k of 0.16. The estimated k for MERS, which emerged in 2012, is about 0.25. In the flu pandemic of 1918, in contrast, the value was about one, indicating that clusters played less of a role.

Estimates of k for SARS-CoV-2 vary. In January, Julien Riou and Christian Althaus at the University of Bern simulated the epidemic in China for different combinations of R and k and compared the outcomes with what had actually taken place. They concluded that k for COVID-19 is somewhat higher than for SARS and MERS. That seems about right, says Gabriel Leung, a modeler at the University of Hong Kong. “I don’t think this is quite like SARS or MERS, where we observed very large superspreading clusters,” Leung says. “But we are certainly seeing a lot of concentrated clusters where a small proportion of people are responsible for a large proportion of infections.” But in a recent preprint, Adam Kucharski of LSHTM estimated that k for COVID-19 is as low as 0.1. “Probably about 10% of cases lead to 80% of the spread,” Kucharski says.

That could explain some puzzling aspects of this pandemic, including why the virus did not take off around the world sooner after it emerged in China, and why some very early cases elsewhere—such as one in France in late December 2019, reported on 3 May—apparently failed to ignite a wider outbreak. If k is really 0.1, then most chains of infection die out by themselves and SARS-CoV-2 needs to be introduced undetected into a new country at least four times to have an even chance of establishing itself, Kucharski says. If the Chinese epidemic was a big fire that sent sparks flying around the world, most of the sparks simply fizzled out.

Why coronaviruses cluster so much more than other pathogens is “a really interesting open scientific question,” says Christophe Fraser of the University of Oxford, who has studied superspreading in Ebola and HIV. Their mode of transmission may be one factor. SARS-CoV-2 appears to transmit mostly through droplets, but it does occasionally spread through finer aerosols that can stay suspended in the air, enabling one person to infect many. Most published large transmission clusters “seem to implicate aerosol transmission,” Fraser says.

Individual patients’ characteristics play a role as well. Some people shed far more virus, and for a longer period of time, than others, perhaps because of differences in their immune system or the distribution of virus receptors in their body. A 2019 study of healthy people showed some breathe out many more particles than others when they talk. (The volume at which they spoke explained some of the variation.) Singing may release more virus than speaking, which could help explain the choir outbreaks. People’s behavior also plays a role. Having many social contacts or not washing your hands makes you more likely to pass on the virus.

The factor scientists are closest to understanding is where COVID-19 clusters are likely to occur. “Clearly there is a much higher risk in enclosed spaces than outside,” Althaus says. Researchers in China studying the spread of the coronavirus outside Hubei province—ground zero for the pandemic—identified 318 clusters of three or more cases between 4 January and 11 February, only one of which originated outdoors. A study in Japan found that the risk of infection indoors is almost 19 times higher than outdoors. (Japan, which was hit early but has kept the epidemic under control, has built its COVID-19 strategy explicitly around avoiding clusters, advising citizens to avoid closed spaces and crowded conditions.)

Some situations may be particularly risky. Meatpacking plants are likely vulnerable because many people work closely together in spaces where low temperature helps the virus survive. But it may also be relevant that they tend to be loud places, Knight says. The report about the choir in Washington made her realize that one thing links numerous clusters: They happened in places where people shout or sing. And although Zumba classes have been connected to outbreaks, Pilates classes, which are not as intense, have not, Knight notes. “Maybe slow, gentle breathing is not a risk factor, but heavy, deep, or rapid breathing and shouting is.”

Probably about 10% of cases lead to 80% of the spread. Adam Kucharski, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine

Timing also plays a role. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 patients are most infectious for a short period of time. Entering a high-risk setting in that period may touch off a superspreading event, Kucharski says; “Two days later, that person could behave in the same way and you wouldn’t see the same outcome.”

Countries that have beaten back the virus to low levels need to be especially vigilant for superspreading events, because they can easily undo hard-won gains. After South Korea relaxed social distancing rules in early May, a man who later tested positive for COVID-19 visited several clubs in Seoul; public health officials scrambled to identify thousands of potential contacts and have already found 170 new cases.

If public health workers knew where clusters are likely to happen, they could try to prevent them and avoid shutting down broad swaths of society, Kucharski says. “Shutdowns are an incredibly blunt tool,” he says. “You’re basically saying: We don’t know enough about where transmission is happening to be able to target it, so we’re just going to target all of it.”

But studying large COVID-19 clusters is harder than it seems. Many countries have not collected the kind of detailed contact tracing data needed. And the shutdowns have been so effective that they also robbed researchers of a chance to study superspreading events. (Before the shutdowns, “there was probably a 2-week window of opportunity when a lot of these data could have been collected,” Fraser says.)

The research is also prone to bias, Knight says. People are more likely to remember attending a basketball game than, say, getting a haircut, a phenomenon called recall bias that may make clusters seem bigger than they are. Clusters that have an interesting social angle—such as prison outbreaks—may get more media coverage and thus jump out to researchers, while others remain hidden. Clusters of mostly asymptomatic infections may be missed altogether.

Privacy is another concern. Untangling the links between patients can reveal who was at the origin of a cluster or expose information about people’s private lives. In its report about the chorus, CDC left out a seating map that could show who brought the virus to the practice. Some clubs involved in the new South Korean cluster were gay venues, which resulted in an antigay backlash and made contact tracing harder.

Fraser, who is tracking HIV transmission in Africa by sequencing virus isolates, says it is a difficult trade-off, but one that can be managed through good oversight and engagement with communities. Epidemiologists have “a duty” to study clusters, he says: “Understanding these processes is going to improve infection control, and that’s going to improve all of our lives.”",2020-05-19 17:25:00-04:00,
Identifying airborne transmission as the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19,"Significance We have elucidated the transmission pathways of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in the three epicenters. Our results show that the airborne transmission route is highly virulent and dominant for the spread of COVID-19. The mitigation measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the trends of the pandemic. This protective measure significantly reduces the number of infections. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. Our work also highlights the necessity that sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and future public health pandemics.

Abstract Various mitigation measures have been implemented to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including widely adopted social distancing and mandated face covering. However, assessing the effectiveness of those intervention practices hinges on the understanding of virus transmission, which remains uncertain. Here we show that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease. By analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, from January 23 to May 9, 2020, we illustrate that the impacts of mitigation measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the pandemic trends in the three epicenters. This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 75,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work also highlights the fact that sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and future public health pandemics.

The novel coronavirus outbreak, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, has infected over 4 million people and caused nearly 300,000 fatalities over 188 countries (1). Intensive effort is ongoing worldwide to establish effective treatments and develop a vaccine for the disease. The novel coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belongs to the family of the pathogen that is responsible for respiratory illness linked to the 2002–2003 outbreak (SARS-CoV-1) (2). The enveloped virus contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry of ∼120 nm. There exist several plausible pathways for viruses to be transmitted from person to person. Human atomization of virus-bearing particles occurs from coughing/sneezing and even from normal breathing/talking by an infected person (3⇓⇓–6). These mechanisms of viral shedding produce large droplets and small aerosols (3), which are conventionally delineated at a size of 5 μm to characterize their distinct dispersion efficiencies and residence times in air as well as the deposition patterns along the human respiratory tract (3, 7). Virus transmission occurs via direct (deposited on persons) or indirect (deposited on objects) contact and airborne (droplets and aerosols) routes (3). Large droplets readily settle out of air to cause person/object contamination; in contrast, aerosols are efficiently dispersed in air. While transmission via direct or indirect contact occurs in a short range, airborne transmission via aerosols can occur over an extended distance and time. Inhaled virus-bearing aerosols deposit directly along the human respiratory tract.

Previous experimental and observational studies on interhuman transmission have indicated a significant role of aerosols in the transmission of many respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (8⇓⇓–11). For example, airborne coronavirus MERS-CoV exhibited strong capability of surviving, with about 64% of microorganisms remaining infectious 60 min after atomization at 25 °C and 79% relative humidity (RH) (9). On the other hand, rapid virus decay occurred, with only 5% survival over a 60-min procedure at 38 °C and 24% RH, indicative of inactivation. Recent experimental studies have examined the stability of SARS-CoV-2, showing that the virus remains infectious in aerosols for hours (12) and on surfaces up to days (12, 13).

Several parameters likely influence the microorganism survival and delivery in air, including temperature, humidity, microbial resistance to external physical and biological stresses, and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation (8). Transmission and infectivity of airborne viruses are also dependent on the size and number concentration of inhaled aerosols, which regulate the amount (dose) and pattern for respiratory deposition. With typical nasal breathing (i.e., at a velocity of ∼1 m⋅s−1) (4), inhalation of airborne viruses leads to direct and continuous deposition into the human respiratory tract. In particular, fine aerosols (i.e., particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm, or PM 2.5 ) penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and even reach other vital organs (14, 15). In addition, viral shedding is dependent on the stages of infection and varies between symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. A recent finding (16) showed that the highest viral load in the upper respiratory tract occurs at the symptom onset, suggesting the peak of infectiousness on or before the symptom onset and substantial asymptomatic transmission for SARS-CoV-2.

The COVID-19 outbreak is significantly more pronounced than that of the 2002/2003 SARS, and the disease continues to spread at an alarming rate worldwide, despite extreme measures taken by many countries to constrain the pandemic (1). The enormous scope and magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak reflect not only a highly contagious nature but also exceedingly efficient transmission for SARS-CoV-2. Currently, the mechanisms to spread the virus remain uncertain (17), particularly considering the relative contribution of the contact vs. airborne transmission routes to this global pandemic. Available epidemiological (1) and experimental (12, 18) evidence, however, implicates airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols as a potential route for the spreading of the disease.

Distinct Pandemic Trends in the Three Epicenters To gain insight into the mechanism of the virus transmission routes and assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures, we analyzed the trend of the pandemic worldwide from January 23 to May 9, 2020 (Fig. 1). The COVID-19 outbreak initially emerged during December 2019 in Wuhan, China (1). The numbers of confirmed infections and fatalities in China dominated the global trend during January and February 2020 (Fig. 1 A and B), but the increases in the newly confirmed cases and fatalities in China have exhibited sharp declines since February (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the curve flattening in China, those numbers in other countries have increased sharply since the beginning of March. The epicenter shifted from Wuhan to Italy in early March and to New York City (NYC) in early April. By April 30, the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively, reached over 200,000 and 27,000 in Italy and over 1,000,000 and 52,000 in the United States, compared to about 84,000 and 4,600 in China (Fig. 1B). Notably, the curves in Italy exhibit a slowing trend since mid-April, while the numbers in the world and the United States continue to increase. Remarkably, the recent trends in the numbers of infections and fatalities in the world and in the United States exhibit striking linearity since the beginning of April (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1. Distinct global trends of the COVID-19 pandemic. (A) Confirmed infections and fatalities worldwide. (B) Comparison of the confirmed infections and fatalities between China, Italy, and United States. (C) Linear regression of the confirmed infections and fatalities worldwide and in United States from April 1 to May 9, 2020; the linear regression is, respectively, y = 79,398x + 810,167 (R2 = 0.999) for infections and y = 6,075x + 39,409 (R2 = 0.998) for fatalities worldwide and y = 28,971x + 201,187 (R2 = 0.999) for infections and y = 2,059x + 243 (R2 = 0.995) for fatalities in the United States. The left axis and black color correspond to the numbers of confirmed infections, and the right axis and red color represent the confirmed fatalities. We interpreted the differences in the pandemic trends by considering the mitigation measures implemented worldwide. The curve flattening in China can be attributed to extensive testing, quarantine, and contact tracing; other aggressive measures implemented in China include lockdown of all cities and rural areas in the whole country, isolation of residents having close contact with infected people, and mandated wearing of face masks in public. However, the effectiveness of those mitigation measures has yet to be rigorously evaluated. Differentiation of the effects of those mitigation measures in China is challenging (19), since the implementation occurred almost simultaneously in January 2020. While similar quarantine, isolation, and city lockdown measures were also implemented on March 9 in Italy after the country became the second epicenter, the curve of infections has yet to show complete flattening. In the United States, guidelines for social distancing, quarantine, and isolation were issued by the federal government on March 16, and stay-at-home orders were implemented by many state and local governments starting, for example, between March 19 and April 3 and on March 22 in NYC. The social distancing measures implemented in the United States include staying at least 6 feet (∼2 m) away from other people, no gathering in groups, staying out of crowded places, and avoiding mass gatherings (20). Obviously, the continuous rise in the US infected numbers casts doubt on the effectiveness of those preventive measures alone (Fig. 1 B and C). In contrast to China, wearing of face masks was not mandated and was unpopular in most of the western world during the early outbreak of the pandemic. Advice on the use of face masks was not issued until April 6, 2020 by the WHO (1), claiming that it is important only to prevent infected persons from viral transmission by filtering out droplets but that it is unimportant to prevent uninfected persons from breathing virus-bearing aerosols. The regions heavily plagued by COVID-19 in northern Italy, such as Lombard, ordered face covering in public starting on April 6, and the Italian authorities required nationwide mandatory use of face masks on May 4. All New Yorkers were mandated to use face covering in public starting on April 17, when social distancing was not possible. With measures implemented in the United States seemingly comparable to those in China, social distancing, quarantine, and isolation exhibited little impact on stopping the spreading of the disease in the United States, as reflected by the linearity from April 1 to May 9 (Fig. 1C). It is possible, however, that these measures alter the slope of the infection curve, that is, by reducing the rate of infections during the early stage of the pandemic (Fig. 1). Notably, the recommended physical separation for social distancing is beneficial to prevent direct contact transmission but is insufficient (without face masks) to protect inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols (or even small droplets at intermediate proximity), owing to rapid air mixing (7).

Understanding the Impacts of Face Covering Compared to the simultaneous implementation of measures in China, intervention measures were successively implemented in the western world (Fig. 2A), providing an opportunity for assessing their relative effectiveness. We quantified the effects of face covering by projecting the number of infections based on the data prior to implementing the use of face masks in Italy on April 6 and NYC on April 17 (Fig. 2A; see Methods). Such projections are reasonable considering the excellent linear correlation for the data prior to the onset of mandated face covering (Fig. 2 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Our analysis indicates that face covering reduced the number of infections by over 75,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and by over 66,000 in NYC from April 17 to May 9. In addition, varying the correlation from 15 d to 30 d prior to the onset of the implementation reveals little difference in the projection for both places, because of the high correlation coefficients (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Notably, the trends of the infection curves in Italy and NYC contrast to those in the world and in the United States (Fig. 1C), which show little deviation from the linearity due to the nonimplementation of face-covering measures globally and nationally, respectively. The inability of social distancing, quarantine, and isolation alone to curb the spread of COVID-19 is also evident from the linearity of the infection curve prior to the onset of the face-covering rule in Italy on April 6 and in NYC on April 17 (Fig. 2 B and C). Hence, the difference made by implementing face covering significantly shapes the pandemic trends worldwide. Fig. 2. The evolving epicenter from Wuhan, to Italy, to NYC. (A) Comparison of the trends and mitigation measures between Wuhan, Italy, and NYC in 2020. The vertical lines mark the date for implementing mitigation measures. The two black circles label the dates when face covering was implemented: April 6 in northern Italy and April 17 in NYC. The black dashed lines represent the projection without face covering based on linear regression of 26-d data prior to implementing this measure. (B) Linear regression of the number of confirmed infections for 26-d data prior to implementing face covering in Italy. The shaded vertical line denotes the date when face covering was implemented on April 6 in northern Italy. (C) Linear regression of the number of confirmed infections for 26-d data prior to implementing face covering in NYC. The shaded vertical line denotes the date when face covering was implemented on April 17 in NYC. In B and C, the circles are reported values, and the dotted line represents fitting and projection of the confirmed infections before and after face-covering, respectively. We further compared the numbers of daily new cases between NYC and the United States (excluding the data in New York State) from March 1 to May 9 (Fig. 3). The daily numbers of newly confirmed infections in NYC and the United States show a sharp increase in late March and early April. There exists a slower increase in the number after implementation of the stay-at-home order (about 14 d in NYC and shortly after April 3 in the United States), which is attributable to the impacts of this measure. After April 3, the only difference in the regulatory measures between NYC and the United States lies in face covering on April 17 in NYC. We applied linear regression to the data between April 17 and May 9 in NYC and between April 5 and May 9 in the United States. While the daily numbers of newly confirmed infections fluctuate considerably, the slope of the regression unambiguously reflects the trend in both data. The daily new infection in NYC decreases with a slope of 106 cases per day after April 17, corresponding to a decreasing rate of ∼3% per day (relative to April 17). For comparison, the daily new infections in the United States (excluding New York State) increase, with a slope of 70 cases per day after April 4, corresponding to an increasing trend of ∼0.3% per day (relative to April 5). Hence, the decreasing rate in the daily new infections in NYC with mandated face covering is in sharp contrast to that in the United States with only social-distancing and stay-at-home measures, further confirming the importance of face covering in intervening the virus transmission. Fig. 3. Contrasting the trends of new infections between NYC and the United States. Daily new confirmed infections in (A) NYC and (B) the United States. The dotted lines represent linear fitting to the data between April 17 and May 9 in NYC and between April 4 and May 9 in the United States. In B, the number in New York State was subtracted from that in the United States. The vertical lines label the dates for social distancing, stay-at-home orders (the shaded area for the range of implementing dates for different states), and mandated face-covering.

Dominant Airborne Transmission We further elucidated the contribution of airborne transmission to the COVID-19 outbreak by comparing the trends and mitigation measures during the pandemic worldwide and by considering the virus transmission routes (Fig. 4). Face covering prevents both airborne transmission by blocking atomization and inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols and contact transmission by blocking viral shedding of droplets. On the other hand, social distancing, quarantine, and isolation, in conjunction with hand sanitizing, minimize contact (direct and indirect) transmission but do not protect against airborne transmission. With social distancing, quarantine, and isolation in place worldwide and in the United States since the beginning of April, airborne transmission represents the only viable route for spreading the disease, when mandated face covering is not implemented. Similarly, airborne transmission also contributes dominantly to the linear increase in the infection prior to the onset of mandated face covering in Italy and NYC (Fig. 2 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Hence, the unique function of face covering to block atomization and inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols accounts for the significantly reduced infections in China, Italy, and NYC (Figs. 1–3), indicating that airborne transmission of COVID-19 represents the dominant route for infection. Fig. 4. Transmission of COVID-19. Human atomization of viruses arises from coughing or sneezing of an infected person, producing virus-containing droplets (>5 μm) and aerosols (<5 μm). Virus transmission from person to person occurs through direct/indirect contact and airborne aerosol/droplet routes. Large droplets mainly settle out of air to cause person/object contamination, while aerosols are efficiently dispersed in air. Direct and airborne transmissions occur in short range and extended distance/time, respectively. Inhaled airborne viruses deposit directly into the human respiration tract. Recent measurements identified SARS-Cov-2 RNA on aerosols in Wuhan’s hospitals (18) and outdoor in northern Italy (21), unraveling the likelihood of indoor and outdoor airborne transmission. Within an enclosed environment, virus-bearing aerosols from human atomization are readily accumulated, and elevated levels of airborne viruses facilitate transmission from person to person. Transmission of airborne viruses in open air is subject to dilution, although virus accumulation still occurs due to stagnation under polluted urban conditions (7, 22). Removal of virus-bearing particles from human atomization via deposition is strongly size dependent, with the settling velocities ranging from 2.8 × 10−5 m⋅s−1 to 1.4 × 10−3 m⋅s−1 for the sizes of 1 and 10 μm, respectively (7). For comparison, typical wind velocity is about 1 m⋅s−1 to 3 m⋅s−1 indoors (23) and is ∼1 m⋅s−1 horizontally and 0.1 m⋅s−1 vertically in stable air (7, 22). Under those indoor and outdoor conditions, the residence time of virus-bearing aerosols reaches hours, due to air mixing (7). We also examined ambient conditions relevant to the outbreaks in Wuhan, Italy, and NYC. The initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan coincided with the winter haze season in China (7, 22), during which high levels of PM 2.5 were prevalent in air (SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3). On the other hand, the daily average PM 2.5 concentrations were much lower during the outbreaks in Rome, Italy, and in NYC (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). The airborne transmission pathways (i.e., indoor or outdoor) as well as the effects of ambient PM 2.5 levels on virus transmission may be variable among urban cities. For example, the winter haze conditions in China likely exacerbated outdoor virus spreading (24, 25), because of low UV radiation, air stagnation (lacking ventilation on the city scale), and low temperature (7, 22). Also, there may exist a synergetic effect of simultaneous exposure to the virus and PM 2.5 to enhance the infectivity, severity, and fatalities of the disease (14, 26). In addition, nascent virus-bearing aerosols produced from human atomization likely undergo transformation in air, including coagulation with ambient preexisting PM and/or growth on a time scale of a few hours in typical urban air (27⇓–29). Such transformation, as recently documented on coarse PM in Italy (21), may mitigate virus inactivation (9, 12), by providing a medium to preserve its biological properties and elongating its lifetimes. However, key questions remain concerning transformation and transmission of virus-bearing aerosols from human atomization in air. Specifically, what are the impacts of transformation of human-atomized aerosols on viral surviving and infectivity in air? While the humidity effect on viral surviving is uncertain (3, 9), the conditions during the outbreaks in Wuhan, Rome, and NYC correspond to high RH yet low absolute humidity because of low temperature (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Early experimental work (9) showed remarkable survival for the analogous coronavirus MERS-CoV at the RH level characteristic of the COVID-19 outbreaks in Wuhan, Rome, and NYC. For comparison, indoor temperature and RH typically range from 21 °C to 27 °C and 20 to 70%, respectively (23). Of particular importance are the considerations that render airborne SARS-CoV-2 the most efficient among all transmission routes. Even with normal nasal breathing, inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols results in deep and continuous deposition into the human respiratory tract, and this transmission route typically requires a low dose (8). Also, airborne viruses have great mobility and sufficiently long surviving time for dispersion (9, 12), and residents situated in densely populated environments are highly vulnerable. In addition, nascent micrometer-size aerosols produced from coughing/sneezing of infected people have the potential of containing many viruses, particularly for asymptomatic carriers (16). Future research is critically needed to assess the transmission, transformation, and dispersion of virus-bearing aerosols from human atomization under different environmental conditions, as well as the related impacts on virus infectivity. It is equally important to understand human atomization of airborne viruses: What are the number and size distributions of nascent aerosols as well as the viral load per particle from coughing/sneezing? It is also imperative to evaluate human inhalation of airborne viruses: How are aerosols deposited along the respiratory tract, and what is the minimum dose of airborne viruses required for infection? It is also important to evaluate the performance of face masks to quantify the efficiency to filtrate airborne viruses relevant to human atomization and inhalation. Elucidation of these mechanisms requires an interdisciplinary effort.

A Policy Perspective The governments’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have so far differed significantly worldwide. Swift actions to the initial outbreak were undertaken in China, as reflected by nearly simultaneous implementation of various aggressive mitigation measures. On the other hand, the response to the pandemic was generally slow in the western world, and implementation of the intervention measures occurred only consecutively. Clearly, the responsiveness of the mitigation measures governed the evolution, scope, and magnitude of the pandemic globally (Figs. 1 and 2). Curbing the COVID-19 relies not only on decisive and sweeping actions but also, critically, on the scientific understanding of the virus transmission routes, which determines the effectiveness of the mitigation measures (Fig. 5). In the United States, social distancing and stay-at-home measures, in conjunction with hand sanitizing (Fig. 5, path A), were implemented during the early stage of the pandemic (20). These measures minimized short-range contact transmission but did not prevent long-range airborne transmission, responsible for the inefficient containing of the pandemic in the United States (Figs. 1 and 3). Mandated face covering, such as those implemented in China, Italy, and NYC, effectively prevented airborne transmission by blocking atomization and inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols and contact transmission by blocking viral shedding of droplets. While the combined face-covering and social distancing measures offered dual protection against the virus transmission routes, the timing and sequence in implementing the measures also exhibited distinct outcomes during the pandemic. For example, social distancing measures, including city lockdown and stay-at-home orders, were implemented well before face covering was mandated in Italy and NYC (Fig. 5, path B), and this sequence left an extended window (28 d in Italy and 32 d in NYC) for largely uninterrupted airborne transmission to spread the disease (Figs. 2 and 3). The simultaneous implementation of face covering and social distancing (Fig. 5, path C), such as that undertaken in China, was most optimal, and this configuration, in conjunction with extensive testing and contact tracing, was responsible for the curve flattening in China (Fig. 1). Also, there likely existed remnants of virus transmission after the implementation of regulatory measures, because of circumstances when the measures were not practical or were disobeyed and/or imperfection of the measures. Such limitations, which have been emphasized by the WHO (1), spurred on controversial views on the validity of wearing face masks to prevent the virus transmission during the pandemic (30). However, it is implausible that the limitations of mitigation measures alone contributed dominantly to the global pandemic trend, as exemplified by the success in China. Our work suggests that the failure in containing the propagation of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide is largely attributed to the unrecognized importance of airborne virus transmission (1, 20). Fig. 5. Mitigation paradigm. Scenarios of virus transmission under the distancing/quarantine/isolation measure only (path A), the measures with distancing/quarantine/isolation followed by face covering (path B), and the measures with simultaneous face covering and distancing/quarantine/isolation (path C). The short-dashed arrows label possible remnants of virus transmission due to circumstances when the measure is not possible or disobeyed and/or imperfection of the measure.

Conclusions The inadequate knowledge on virus transmission has inevitably hindered development of effective mitigation policies and resulted in unstoppable propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic (Figs. 1–3). In this work, we show that airborne transmission, particularly via nascent aerosols from human atomization, is highly virulent and represents the dominant route for the transmission of this disease. However, the importance of airborne transmission has not been considered in establishment of mitigation measures by government authorities (1, 20). Specifically, while the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have emphasized the prevention of contact transmission, both WHO and CDC have largely ignored the importance of the airborne transmission route (1, 20). The current mitigation measures, such as social distancing, quarantine, and isolation implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the trends of the pandemic worldwide. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with extensive testing, quarantine, and contact tracing, poses the most probable fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, prior to the development of a vaccine. It is also important to emphasize that sound science should be effectively communicated to policy makers and should constitute the prime foundation in decision-making amid this pandemic. Implementing policies without a scientific basis could lead to catastrophic consequences, particularly in light of attempts to reopen the economy in many countries. Clearly, integration between science and policy is crucial to formulation of effective emergency responses by policy makers and preparedness by the public for the current and future public health pandemics.

Methods Projection of the pandemic trend without implementing face covering in Italy and NYC was performed first by establishing the linear correlation between the infection number and date. We considered the data for both 15 and 26 d prior to the onset of face covering (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). The slope and the reported infection number were used for the projections. The avoided infection number due the face covering was determined from the difference between the projected and reported values on May 9, 2020. The data for accumulative confirmed infections and fatalities in Wuhan, Italy, and NYC were taken from the reports by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/), European CDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en), and NYC government (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page), respectively. The data of accumulative confirmed infections and fatalities worldwide were taken from WHO COVID-19 situation report (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) (1), and the numbers in China, Italy, and United States were from taken from European CDC. Ground-based measurements of PM 2.5 and RH in Wuhan were taken from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre (http://beijingair.sinaapp.com/). The PM 2.5 data in NYC were taken from US Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data). The PM 2.5 data in Rome were taken were from Centro Regionale della Qualità dell’aria (http://www.arpalazio.net/main/aria/). The RH data in Rome and NYC were taken from the 6-hourly interim reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5). We used spaceborne measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to characterize the regional aerosol pollution during the COVID-19 outbreak (January 23 to February 10, 2020) in China. The green band AODs at 0.55 μm are available from Terra and Aqua combined Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Version 6 Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd19a2v006/). The Level-2 product has daily global coverage with 1-km pixel resolution. The AOD retrieval is only available for the clear sky. Data Availability.

Coronavirus: Kidney Damage Caused by COVID-19,"Coronavirus: Kidney Damage Caused by COVID-19

Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest Print

Featured Experts:

COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus that’s led to the global pandemic —is known to damage the lungs. But, as more people become infected, more understanding of the disease emerges. Doctors and researchers are finding that this coronavirus — officially called SARS-CoV-2—can also cause severe and lasting harm in other organs, including the heart and kidneys. C. John Sperati, M.D., M.H.S., an expert in kidney health, discusses how the new coronavirus might affect kidney function as the illness develops and afterward as a person recovers.

COVID-19 Kidney Damage: A Possible Complication Some people suffering with severe cases of COVID-19 are showing signs of kidney damage, even those who had no underlying kidney problems before they were infected with the coronavirus. Early reports say that up to 30% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in China and New York developed moderate or severe kidney injury. Reports from doctors in New York are saying the percentage could be higher. Signs of kidney problems in patients with COVID-19 include high levels of protein in the urine and abnormal blood work. The kidney damage is, in some cases, severe enough to require dialysis. Some hospitals experiencing surges of patients who are very ill with COVID-19 have reported they are running short on the machines and sterile fluids needed to perform these kidney procedures. “Many patients with severe COVID-19 are those with co-existing, chronic conditions, including high blood pressure and diabetes. Both of these increase the risk of kidney disease,” Sperati says. But Sperati and other doctors are also seeing kidney damage in people who did not have kidney problems before they got infected with the virus.

How does COVID-19 damage the kidneys? The impact of COVID-19 on the kidneys isn’t yet clear. Here are some possibilities doctors and researchers are exploring: Coronavirus might target kidney cells The virus itself infects the cells of the kidney. Kidney cells have receptors that enable the new coronavirus to attach to them, invade, and make copies of itself, potentially damaging those tissues. Similar receptors are found on cells of the lungs and heart, where the new coronavirus has been shown to cause injury. Too little oxygen can cause kidneys to malfunction Another possibility is that kidney problems in patients with the coronavirus are due to abnormally low levels of oxygen in the blood, a result of the pneumonia commonly seen in severe cases of the disease. Cytokine storms can destroy kidney tissue The body’s reaction to the infection may be responsible as well. The immune response to the new coronavirus can be extreme in some people, leading to what is called a cytokine storm. When that happens, the immune system sends a rush of cytokines into the body. Cytokines are small proteins that help the cells communicate as the immune system fights an infection. But this sudden, large influx of cytokines can cause severe inflammation. In trying to kill the invading virus, this inflammatory reaction can destroy healthy tissue, including that of the kidneys. COVID-19 causes blood clots that might clog the kidneys The kidneys are like filters that screen out toxins, extra water and waste products from the body. COVID-19 can cause tiny clots to form in the bloodstream, which can clog the smallest blood vessels in the kidney and impair its function.

Johns Hopkins Team Develops Method to Make Dialysis Fluid for Patients with COVID-19 When New York-based hospitals started running out of dialysis fluid for the type of dialysis used in intensive care, a team from Johns Hopkins answered the call. Read more

Coronavirus Kidney Damage: A Serious Sign Organ systems like the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys rely on and support one another's’ functions, so when the new coronavirus causes damage in one area, others might be at risk. The kidneys’ essential functions have an impact on the heart, lungs and other systems. That may be why doctors note that kidney damage arising in patients with COVID-19 is a possible warning sign of a serious, even fatal course of the disease. Can kidneys recover after COVID-19? As of yet, Sperati says, it’s uncertain how many people with COVID-19-related kidney damage regain their kidney function. He says, “Patients with acute kidney injury due to COVID-19 who do not require dialysis will have better outcomes than those who need dialysis, and we have seen patients at Johns Hopkins who recover kidney function. We have even had patients in the ICU with acute kidney injury who have required dialysis, and subsequently regained their kidney function. How often that occurs is still not known, but without question, the need for dialysis is a worrisome development in patients with COVID-19.” Should I keep taking my high blood pressure medication? Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a common cause of kidney problems. Hypertension damages the blood vessels of the kidneys and affects their ability to filter the blood. Kidneys also help to regulate blood pressure, so kidney damage can make hypertension worse. Over time, hypertension can cause kidney failure. If you are living with hypertension, you might take medication for the problem. You may be reading news reports questioning the safety of taking certain prescription medicines to manage their condition: ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Sperati says that patients should stay on their medications and discuss concerns with their doctors. “Right now there are two sides debating this issue. One side is saying, based on animal studies, that these medications might be harmful, increasing risk of infection. The other says these same drugs might protect against lung damage and other problems associated with COVID-19. “But all of the professional societies have published articles recommending that you not change your medications,” he says. Staying the course with your prescriptions, he adds, can lower the risk of heart and kidney damage from unchecked high blood pressure. Sperati does recommend that patients with kidney issues stay away from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen. These can raise blood pressure and increase fluid volume in the body, which puts strain on the kidneys.

Research is revealing more about SARS-CoV-2 kidney damage While kidney damage in COVID-19 is still not well understood, more data will reveal how this occurs. Sperati, who also conducts research on kidney disease, says the Johns Hopkins Division of Nephrology is exploring exactly how SARS-CoV-2 — and the body’s response to it — is affecting kidney health. He says that patients with COVID-19-related kidney damage should follow up with their doctors to ensure kidney function is returning to normal. Lasting kidney damage might require dialysis or other therapies even after recovery from COVID-19. Mostly, Sperati stresses the importance of adhering to guidelines around physical distancing and hand-washing, the basics of prevention. “For everyone, especially people with underlying chronic disease, avoiding infection with COVID-19 for as long as you can is crucial,” he says. “Right now, we don’t have a treatment or vaccine for this disease. The longer a person can go without getting infected, the better chance they have of benefiting from a future therapy.”

Race gaps in COVID-19 deaths are even bigger than they appear,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been like the flash of an X-ray, exposing the deep fractures in U.S. society – not least by race. New data from CDC shows that the death rates among Black and Hispanic/Latino people are much higher than for white people, in all age categories:

Stark inequalities in COVID outcomes exist for the American Indian and Alaska Native population as well, however information on death rates for these groups is incomplete. Here, we focus on the three largest racial/ethnic groups, white, Black, and Hispanic/Latino, for which data are more reliable and which account for 93% of all COVID deaths reported by the CDC (through June 6).[1]

Death rates among Black people between 55-64 years are higher than for white people aged 65-74, and death rates are higher for Blacks aged 65-74 than for whites aged 75-84, and so on. In every age category, Black people are dying from COVID at roughly the same rate as white people more than a decade older. Age-specific death rates for Hispanic/Latino people fall in between.

These disparities can be observed at all ages, but are especially marked in somewhat younger age groups. These disparities can be seen more clearly by comparing the ratio of death rates among Black and Hispanic/Latino people to the rate for white people in each age category. Among those aged 45-54, for example, Black and Hispanic/Latino death rates are at least six times higher than for whites:

Whites comprise 62% of people in the U.S. between ages 45-54. In that age group, 1,013 white people have died from COVID-19 (22% of the total) compared to 1,448 Black people and 1,698 Hispanic/Latino people.

What’s behind the race gap in Covid-19 deaths?

A number of factors are likely contributing to the substantial race gaps in mortality rates. These factors may be influencing the risk of infection and/or the risk of death among those infected. Infection rates could be higher among Black and Hispanic/Latino people because of occupations, less social distancing – and especially geography. The parts of the country hit hardest so far by COVID-19 have larger Black and Hispanic/Latino populations. The CDC has produced data showing the percentage of reported deaths by race compared to the population weighted by the geography of the pandemic. These data suggest that Black and white people account for a slightly higher share of the COVID-19 deaths than of the population of locations where the pandemic hit hardest, while Hispanic/Latino people account for a smaller share. Critically, however, these data do not take age into account. (There are concerns about data quality with regard to COVID-19 in general, including the attribution of deaths to the virus, testing rates, and so on; but problems with the data are unlikely to account for these stark differences by race shown here). While geography may be part of the explanation for the race gaps, it does not look to be the main one.

Black and Hispanic/Latino people may also more vulnerable to COVID-19 if they become infected, because of less access to health care or greater prevalence of co-morbidities such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and lung disease – which in turn reflect broader racial inequalities. Our colleague Rashawn Ray has unpacked the structural conditions that may be causing racial inequalities in COVID-19 deaths.

Looking harder at age and race

As we argued in a previous analysis on gender, the need to take age into account is paramount, given the huge age gradient in vulnerability to COVID-19. That is why we focused on age-specific death rates above. It bears underlining that a much higher percentage of the white population is in older age groups. Older people are more likely to die from COVID-19 (shown in the black line below), and whites are much more likely to be in the oldest age groups (shown in the bars), where the COVID-19 death rates are highest. For example, 9% of white people are over 75, compared to 4% of Black people and 3% of Hispanic/Latino people:

Age-adjusted death rates, which account for these differences in the age distributions by race, present a more accurate picture of the differential impact of COVID-19. We calculate the crude COVID-19 death rates and age-adjusted COVID-19 death rates. As expected, the disparities for the age-adjusted death rates are even larger than the substantial disparities in the crude death rates:

The crude death rate (the bars on the left) for Black people is twice that for whites, and the crude death rate for Hispanic/Latinos is similar to that of whites. But accounting for the fact that the Black and especially Hispanic/Latino populations are much younger (the bars on the right), the age-adjusted death rates show larger gaps.. The age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate for Black people is 3.6 times that for whites, and the age-adjusted death rate for Hispanic/Latino people is 2.5 times that for whites.[2]

Racial justice is about health, too

The issue of racial injustice has rightfully joined the pandemic at the top of the national agenda. Protests against the metronomic killing of Black people, especially at the hands of police, are taking place across the country. At the same time, race gaps in vulnerability to COVID-19 highlight the accumulated, intersecting inequities facing Americans of color (but especially Black people) in jobs, housing, education, criminal justice – and in health.

As our former colleague Dayna Bowen Matthew, author of Just Medicine: A Cure for Racial Inequality in American Health Care, puts it: “What we politely call a ‘health disparity’ is killing people of color daily. It is causing people of color to live sicker and die quicker, because of the color of their skin.” The data on COVID-19 provide the latest proof of this enduring fact.

[1] We use the CDC race/ethnicity definitions, so the white and Black categories exclude Hispanic/Latinos, and Hispanic/Latino refers to Hispanic/Latino of any race.

[2] Note that these age-adjusted rates are meant to facilitate comparisons across groups and should not be confused with actual death rates for these populations. But they provide a useful window into understanding the differential impact of COVID-19 by race and ethnicity.",6/16/20 0:00,
"CDC updates, expands list of people at risk of severe COVID-19 illness","Based on a detailed review of available evidence to date, CDC has updated and expanded the list of who is at increased risk for getting severely ill from COVID-19.

Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions remain at increased risk for severe illness, but now CDC has further defined age- and condition-related risks.

As more information becomes available, it is clear that a substantial number of Americans are at increased risk of severe illness – highlighting the importance of continuing to follow preventive measures.

“Understanding who is most at risk for severe illness helps people make the best decisions for themselves, their families, and their communities,” said CDC Director Robert Redfield MD. “While we are all at risk for COVID-19, we need to be aware of who is susceptible to severe complications so that we take appropriate measures to protect their health and well-being.”

COVID-19 risk related to age

CDC has removed the specific age threshold from the older adult classification. CDC now warns that among adults, risk increases steadily as you age, and it’s not just those over the age of 65 who are at increased risk for severe illness.

Recent data, including an MMWR published last week, has shown that the older people are, the higher their risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Age is an independent risk factor for severe illness, but risk in older adults is also in part related to the increased likelihood that older adults also have underlying medical conditions.

COVID-19 risk related to underlying medical conditions

CDC also updated the list of underlying medical conditions that increase risk of severe illness after reviewing published reports, pre-print studies, and various other data sources. CDC experts then determined if there was clear, mixed, or limited evidence that the condition increased a person’s risk for severe illness, regardless of age.

There was consistent evidence (from multiple small studies or a strong association from a large study) that specific conditions increase a person’s risk of severe COVID-19 illness:

Chronic kidney disease

COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)

Obesity (BMI of 30 or higher)

Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant

Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies

Sickle cell disease

Type 2 diabetes

These changes increase the number of people who fall into higher risk groups. An estimated 60 percent of American adults have at least one chronic medical condition. Obesity is one of the most common underlying conditions that increases one’s risk for severe illness – with about 40 percent of U.S. adults having obesity. The more underlying medical conditions people have, the higher their risk.

CDC also clarified the list of other conditions that might increase a person’s risk of severe illness, including additions such as asthma, high blood pressure, neurologic conditions such as dementia, cerebrovascular disease such as stroke, and pregnancy. An MMWR published today further adds to the growing body of research on risk by comparing data on pregnant and nonpregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pregnant women were significantly more likely to be hospitalized, admitted to the intensive care unit, and receive mechanical ventilation than nonpregnant women; however, pregnant women were not at greater risk for death from COVID-19.

Protecting yourself, your family, and your community

Every activity that involves contact with others has some degree of risk right now. Knowing if you are at increased risk for severe illness and understanding the risks associated with different activities of daily living can help you make informed decisions about which activities to resume and what level of risk you will accept. This information is especially critical as communities begin to reopen.

Everyone should continue to do their part to implement prevention strategies, such as focusing on activities where social distancing can be maintained, washing your hands frequently, limiting contact with and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces or shared items, and wearing a cloth face covering when you are around people you do not live with, especially when it is difficult to stay 6 feet apart or when people are indoors. By taking these steps, you can help protect yourself, your loved ones, and others around you, including those most vulnerable to severe illness.

CDC will continue to update and share information about risk for severe illness as more information becomes available. For more information on how to prevent getting sick with COVID-19, visit CDC’s website at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/index.html.",,
Serology Testing for COVID-19 at CDC,"CDC has developed a laboratory test to help estimate how many people in the United States have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Clinicians and researchers refer to this as a serology test, and many commercial laboratories call it an antibody test. CDC is using this serologic (antibody) test to evaluate the performance of commercial antibody tests. CDC will develop guidance for the use of antibody tests in clinical and public health settings.

An antibody test looks for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections. Antibodies are detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection; they show an immune response to the infection. Antibody test results are especially important for detecting previous infections in people who had few or no symptoms.

We do not know if the antibodies that result from SARS-CoV-2 infection will provide someone with protection (immunity) from getting infected again. If antibodies do provide immunity, we don’t know how much antibody is protective or how long protection might last. CDC scientists are currently conducting studies to answer these questions.

CDC’s serologic test has been designed and validated for surveillance and research purposes. It is designed to estimate the percentage of the U.S. population previously infected with the virus – information needed to guide the response to the pandemic and protect the public’s health.

The CDC test is not currently designed to test individuals who want to know if they have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Commercial tests are available to provide test results to individuals.

CDC is evaluating the performance of commercial antibody tests

Commercially manufactured antibody tests check for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in individuals and are available through healthcare providers and commercial laboratories. CDC is evaluating the performance of these tests in collaboration with the following federal organizations:

Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

National Institutes of Health

Department of Defense

White House Office of Science and Technology Policy

Results from the initial federal evaluation are included in FDA’s EUA Authorized Serology Test Performanceexternal icon and will be updated as more tests are evaluated.

Read CDC’s interim guidelines for using antibody tests in clinical and public health settings.

About CDC’s serologic test

CDC’s serologic test is an ELISA-based testexternal icon to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or plasma components of blood. It uses purified SARS-CoV-2 S protein (no live virus) as antigen (designed by the Vaccine Research Centerexternal icon at the National Institutes of Health).

CDC’s serologic test is designed to detect antibodies produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 and minimize cross-reactivity to antibodies generated to other common coronaviruses that cause less severe illnesses, such as colds. However, potential cross-reactivity cannot be completely ruled out.

CDC’s serologic test has a specificity of greater than 99% and a sensitivity of 96% based on initial performance evaluations. It can be used to identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection in people who were infected at least 1 to 3 weeks previously.

CDC serology surveillance strategy

CDC has a strategy for using antibody testing as part of surveillance efforts to better understand how much of the U.S. population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and how the virus is spreading through the population over time.

COVID-19 Considerations for Cleaner Air Shelters and Cleaner Air Spaces to Protect the Public from Wildfire Smoke,"This document provides interim guidance to reduce the risk of introducing and transmitting SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for causing COVID-19) in cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces. Cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces are public spaces where people can seek relief from wildfire smoke. This interim guidance is intended for use by federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions in the United States. It should be used in conjunction with existing cleaner air shelter information, procedures, guidance, and resources.

Overview

Wildfire smoke is a public health concern in the United States. Exposure to wildfire smoke can lead to eye and respiratory tract irritation, exacerbations of existing respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, and premature death.

Cleaner air shelters are used by many communities to provide spaces where people can shelter overnight or for extended periods of time. School gymnasiums, buildings at public fairgrounds, and civic auditoriums are examples of spaces used as cleaner air shelters during wildfires. Cleaner air spaces are used by many communities to provide temporary relief from wildfire smoke; they are often used by individuals who cannot create spaces with adequately clean air in their homes. Examples of cleaner air spaces include libraries, museums, shopping malls, senior centers, and other indoor areas with effective particle filtration and air conditioning.

The use of cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces can result in congregating of groups of people, including older adults and those with heart or lung conditions. Congregation of people in cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces can potentially provide a route for the transmission of SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among individuals using the facilities, staff, and volunteers.

Preparedness Activities and Potential Intervention Strategies

Screening and Alternative Sites for Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Individuals

If resources are available, consider implementing verbal screening or temperature checks upon arrival at cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces and regularly thereafter. If possible, provide separate spaces for those showing symptoms of COVID-19 (i.e., cough, fever, shortness of breath). Separate spaces may include separate rooms within cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces or separate locations that can be used to accommodate individuals with symptoms of COVID-19. Most persons with COVID-19 infections will likely have mild symptoms, or no symptoms, and not require hospital care. Be prepared to contact emergency officials (call 911) in the case of severe illness requiring medical assistance.

Physical Distancing

Maintain social (physical) distancing within cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces. Spaces should be arranged so that there can be at least six feet between individuals, regardless of whether they show symptoms of COVID-19. Consider separation of furniture and creating partitioned spaces for individual family units (families who live together do not need to maintain physical distancing in a cleaner air shelter or cleaner air space). Floor markings, such as with tape, can be used to mark distances between partitioned spaces. Smaller facilities can limit the number of individuals using the cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces, in accordance with state and local guidelines that limit the size of gatherings. This could lower capacity, so consider setting up a larger number of smaller cleaner air shelters or cleaner air spaces. Communities might consider partnering with closed businesses, such as movie theaters, that might serve as alternative cleaner air spaces.

Preparation of Cleaner Air Shelters and Cleaner Air Spaces

Cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces should be prepared using existing information about the identification and preparation of spaces to protect the public from wildfire smoke. Minimum requirements for air conditioning and air filtration are described in Appendix B of Wildfire Smoke: A Guide for Public Health Officialspdf iconexternal icon. At minimum, facilities should have central air conditioning with filtration that is medium or high efficiency, especially at the fresh (outdoor) air intake. Facilities should continue to provide air filtration that is adequate for the expected number of occupants in the space. Portable air cleaners can be used in spaces that can achieve a smoke clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 2/3 of the room volume. Air filtration should not be relied on for controlling the spread of COVID-19; air filtration guidelines are primarily for reducing indoor concentrations of wildfire smoke.

If separate spaces in the same building are needed to separate individuals with and without COVID-19 symptoms, it is important to ensure that air does not flow from the space sheltering individuals with COVID-19 to the space sheltering others. To do so, it may be necessary to work with a qualified heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) professional.

Cleaning

Follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cleaning and disinfection guidelines for community facilities, and information about cleaning and disinfecting buildings and facilities if someone is sick. Even individuals with no symptoms can transmit SARS-CoV-2 and the virus can survive for several days on hard (non-porous) surfaces. Therefore, it is important to continue routine cleaning and disinfection at least every day with a focus on high touch surfaces, including those in common areas and bathrooms, using an EPA-registered disinfectant on List Nexternal icon or a properly diluted bleach solution.

Communication

Enhance onsite communication about COVID-19. Use health messages and materials developed by credible public health sources, such as your state and local public health departments and CDC. Read more about everyday preventive actions. Share or post COVID-19 posters and fact sheets to keep people informed about public health recommendations to prevent disease spread. Messaging may include:

Posting signs at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on: Cloth face coverings Cough etiquette pdf icon Handwashing, especially after coughing, sneezing, and touching a mask or cloth face covering Physical distancing

Providing educational materials about COVID-19 for non-English speakers, as needed

Encouraging ill staff and volunteers to stay home (or to go home if they develop symptoms while at the facility) to prevent transmitting the infection to others

Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to staff, volunteers, and individuals using the cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures.

Prevention Supplies

If available, provide COVID-19 prevention supplies onsite at cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces. Have supplies, such as soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol, tissues, and trash baskets on hand. Staff, volunteers, and individuals using the cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces should wear a cloth face covering, or if supplies are available, be given a clean disposable facemaskpdf icon, even if they are not showing any symptoms. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under 2 years of age, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Place posters that encourage handwashing at the entrance to the facility, at sinks in restrooms, and in other areas where they are likely to be seen. If water bottles are distributed, ensure that bottles or glasses are not shared.

Utility Assistance

Consider implementing or expanding programs that provide utility assistance, such as the low-income home energy assistance program (LIHEAP) or similar methods that provide financial assistance for home air conditioner use. A temporary ban on utility shut offs during wildfires would allow people to continue using home air conditioning and portable air cleaners. This strategy could lower the number of people who cannot stay in their homes during wildfire smoke events and the number of people using cleaner air shelters and cleaner air spaces.

Staff and Volunteers

Plan for staff and volunteer absences. Develop flexible attendance and sick-leave policies. Staff and volunteers should follow CDC interim guidance to prevent workplace exposures and stay home when they are sick. They may also need to stay home when they are caring for a sick household member or their children during school dismissals. Identify critical job functions and positions, and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training cleaner air shelter and cleaner air space staff and volunteers.

All of Us will make data gathered through these activities broadly accessible to approved researchers over time, in future releases of its data platform, the Researcher Workbench, now in beta testing. Analyses may help reveal the origins of entry, spread and impact of COVID-19 in the United States.

“With our nearly 350,000 participant partners across the country, All of Us will enable the research community to answer some of today’s most critical questions and inform future preparedness efforts,” said Josh Denny, M.D., All of Us’s chief executive officer.

Antibody Testing

All of Us will test blood samples from 10,000 or more participants who joined the program most recently, starting with samples from March 2020 and working backward until positive tests are no longer found. The tests will show the prevalence of novel coronavirus exposure among All of Us participants, and help researchers assess varying rates across regions and communities.

Study collaborators include the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, supported by the National Cancer Institute; the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Quest Diagnostics.

Antibody testing, which uses blood samples, is different than the nasal swab tests health care providers commonly use to detect active infection. Antibody tests are generally done with people who do not currently have symptoms, to find out if they had the virus in the past.

The program will look for a certain kind of antibody produced in response to infection, IgG antibodies, using a test approved for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration. Positive samples will potentially undergo further testing to determine if the positive finding is due to the new coronavirus specifically and to assess the level of the immune system’s response.

COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) Survey

In addition to antibody testing, All of Us has deployed a new online survey to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on participants’ physical and mental health. This 20- to 30-minute survey is designed both for participants who have been ill with COVID-19 and those who have not, and includes questions on COVID-19 symptoms, stress, social distancing and economic impacts.

Participants are invited to take the survey each month until the pandemic ends, so researchers can study the effects of COVID-19 over time and better understand how and why COVID-19 affects people differently.

Electronic Health Records

To round out its COVID-19 research efforts, All of Us is rapidly collecting relevant information from participants’ electronic health records. More than 200,000 participants have shared their electronic health records with the program so far, offering a rich dataset for analysis. A number of participants have either been diagnosed with COVID-19 or sought health care for related symptoms. The program is working to standardize EHR information to help researchers look for patterns and learn more about COVID-19 symptoms and associated health problems, as well as the effects of different medicines and treatments.

“Collectively, these efforts are an important step toward helping researchers learn more about COVID-19 and its impact on different communities across the United States,” said Kelly Gebo, M.D., M.P.H., All of Us’s chief medical and scientific officer. “We are grateful to our participants for so generously sharing their information, which will allow us to support research on COVID-19 and other diseases.”

All of Us, which launched national enrollment in 2018, is building a massive research resource with data and samples shared by participants for use in thousands of studies, spanning many different aspects of health and disease.

While the program has temporarily halted in-person biosample collection, new participants can still sign up at JoinAllofUs.org. Participants can complete most program activities online, including answering survey questions and agreeing to share electronic health records. The program removes personal identifiers from this information and stores it in a central platform, with safeguards in place to protect participant privacy. Over the course of the program, participants will receive information back about themselves and about studies that use All of Us data.

“For many, the importance of research has never been more clear,” said Denny. “Our participants share a common hope and sense of purpose--to improve the health of their communities and future generations. None of this work would be possible without them.”

NIH launches analytics platform to harness nationwide COVID-19 patient data to speed treatments,"NIH launches analytics platform to harness nationwide COVID-19 patient data to speed treatments

The National Institutes of Health has launched a centralized, secure enclave to store and study vast amounts of medical record data from people diagnosed with coronavirus disease across the country. It is part of an effort, called the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), to help scientists analyze these data to understand the disease and develop treatments. This effort aims to transform clinical information into knowledge urgently needed to study COVID-19, including health risk factors that indicate better or worse outcomes of the disease, and identify potentially effective treatments.

The N3C is funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of NIH. The initiative will create an analytics platform to systematically collect clinical, laboratory and diagnostic data from health care provider organizations nationwide. It will then harmonize the aggregated information into a standard format and make it available rapidly for researchers and health care providers to accelerate COVID-19 research and provide information that may improve clinical care. A demonstration of the platform can be viewed at ncats.nih.gov/n3c.

Having access to a centralized enclave of this magnitude will help researchers and health care providers answer clinically important questions they previously could not, such as, “Can we predict who might need dialysis because of kidney failure?” or “Who might need to be on a ventilator because of lung failure?” and “Are there different patient responses to coronavirus infection that require distinct therapies?”

“NCATS initially supported the development of this innovative collaborative technology platform to speed the process of understanding the course of diseases, and identifying interventions to effectively treat them,” said NCATS Director Christopher P. Austin, M.D. “This platform was deployed to stand up this important COVID-19 effort in a matter of weeks, and we anticipate that it will serve as the foundation for addressing future public health emergencies.”

Data access will be open to all approved users, regardless of whether they contribute data. The data are being provided to NCATS as a Limited Data Set (LDS) that retains only two of 18 HIPAA-defined elements: patient zip code and dates of service.

NCATS, which is serving as stewards of the data, is taking multiple security and privacy measures. For example, NCATS oversees the use of N3C through user registration, federated login, data use agreements with institutions and data use requests with users. The data reside and remain in NCATS’ secure, cloud-based database certified through the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, which provides standardized assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services ensuring the validity of the data while protecting patient privacy. Approved users must analyze data within the platform. In addition, the N3C data will be used only for COVID-19 research purposes, including clinical and translational research and public health surveillance.

The information available via the N3C enclave will be rich in scope and scale. There currently are 35 collaborating sites across the country and the platform contains diverse data from individuals tested for COVID-19. A key component is the harmonization of data, which translates the different ways that contributing hospitals store patient data into a single, common format to enable combined ‘apples to apples’ analyses. Contributing sites add demographics, symptoms, medications, lab test results, and outcomes data regularly over a five-year period, enabling both the immediate and long-term study of the impact of COVID-19 on health outcomes.

The platform is built to enable machine learning approaches and rigorous statistical analyses, identifying connections and patterns more quickly than can be done through traditional methodologies. These advanced analytics approaches require large, robust datasets to generate statistically valid results and can lead to the simultaneous exploration of multiple questions – and the revealing of likely answers – on a powerful scale.

“The exciting transformation this platform represents is in providing an environment where data and the power of the analytics can be used by researchers and clinicians to quickly examine and answer new COVID-19 hypotheses,” said Warren A. Kibbe, Ph.D., chief of Translational Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics and chief data officer for the Duke Cancer Institute.

The N3C harnesses the extensive resources of the NCATS-funded Clinical and Translational Sciences Awards (CTSA) Program and its Center for Data to Health (CD2H). “By leveraging our collective data resources, unparalleled analytics expertise, and medical insights from expert clinicians, we can catalyze discoveries that address this pandemic that none of us could enable alone,” said Melissa Haendel, Ph.D., director of CD2H at the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine and Director of Translational Data Science at Oregon State University.

NIH-funded study to investigate pregnancy outcomes resulting from COVID-19 pandemic,"NIH-funded study to investigate pregnancy outcomes resulting from COVID-19 pandemic

What

The National Institutes of Health has launched a multipronged study to understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during and after pregnancy. Researchers will analyze the medical records of up to 21,000 women to evaluate whether changes to healthcare delivery that were implemented as a result of the pandemic have led to higher rates of pregnancy-related complications and cesarean delivery. They also seek to establish the risk of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection transmitting the virus to their fetus. Newborns will be monitored and assessed until they are discharged from the hospital.

In addition, the study will track more than 1,500 pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 infection, monitoring their health for six weeks after childbirth.

The study will be conducted by researchers in the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network, a group of 12 U.S. clinical centers funded by NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). MFMU Network sites cover more than 160,000 deliveries a year, and their racial, ethnic, and geographic diversity allows researchers to generalize their study findings to the U.S. population.

MFMU Network investigators plan to contribute data collected from the current study to a larger registry to help inform future studies of how COVID-19 affects maternal health and pregnancy.

NIAID

What

To respond to the generational public health crisis caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, a swift, coordinated effort across many sectors of society is necessary, say National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., and Johnson & Johnson Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels, M.D. In a Viewpoint published today in JAMA, Drs. Collins and Stoffels outline the innovative efforts of Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV), a public-private initiative organized by NIH and the Foundation for the NIH. ACTIV’s partners, which include at least 18 leading biopharmaceutical companies, multiple U.S. federal agencies, and the European Medicines Agency, are developing an international strategy for an integrated research response to COVID-19.

Noting that never has a public-private biomedical research effort of this scope and scale come together with such speed and determination, Drs. Collins and Stoffels describe how ACTIV has established a collaborative framework to prioritize therapeutic and vaccine candidates; to streamline human clinical trials and tap into existing trial networks; and to coordinate regulatory processes and leverage assets among all partners. The authors point out that ACTIV’s industry partners have taken unprecedented steps to support a prioritization of therapeutic and vaccine candidates, no matter who has developed them, and have indicated willingness to contribute their respective clinical trial capacities, irrespective of the agent to be studied.

ACTIV has established four working groups, each with one co-chair from NIH and one from industry. They are:

The Preclinical Working Group . Charged with standardizing and sharing preclinical evaluation resources and methods, and with accelerating testing of candidate therapies and vaccines to support entry into clinical trials.

Investigational ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine protects monkeys against COVID-19 pneumonia,"Investigational ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine protects monkeys against COVID-19 pneumonia

Study provided data for clinical testing to commence.

NIAID

What

A single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, an investigational vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, has protected six rhesus macaques from pneumonia caused by the virus, according to National Institutes of Health scientists and University of Oxford collaborators. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The researchers posted their data to the preprint server bioRxiv. The findings are not yet peer-reviewed but are being shared to assist the public health response to COVID-19. Based on these data, a Phase 1 trial of the candidate vaccine began on April 23 in healthy volunteers in the United Kingdom.

The vaccine was developed at the University of Oxford Jenner Institute. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus to deliver a SARS-CoV-2 protein to induce a protective immune response. ChAdOx1 has been used to develop investigational vaccines against several pathogens, including a closely related coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The scientists quickly adapted the platform to SARS-CoV-2 when the first cases of COVID-19 emerged. They showed that the vaccine rapidly induced immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and rhesus macaques. They then conducted vaccine efficacy testing on the macaques at NIAID’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, Montana. Six animals that received the investigational vaccine 28 days before being infected with SARS-CoV-2 were compared with three control animals that did not receive the vaccine. The vaccinated animals showed no signs of virus replication in the lungs, significantly lower levels of respiratory disease and no lung damage compared to control animals.

Oxford University has entered into a partnership with UK-based global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for the further development, large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of the vaccine.

NIH begins clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to treat COVID-19,"NIH begins clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to treat COVID-19

Study enrolling adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 in the United States.

NIAID

A clinical trial has begun to evaluate whether the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, given together with the antibiotic azithromycin, can prevent hospitalization and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is sponsoring the trial, which is being conducted by the NIAID-funded AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG). Teva Pharmaceuticals is donating medications for the study.

The Phase 2b trial will enroll approximately 2,000 adults at participating ACTG sites across the United States. Study participants must have confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and be experiencing fever, cough and/or shortness of breath. The investigators anticipate that many of those enrolled will be 60 years of age or older or have a comorbidity associated with developing serious complications from COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive short-term treatment with either hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or matching placebos. People living with HIV and pregnant and breastfeeding women also are eligible to participate in the study. The first participant enrolled today in San Diego, California.

“We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. Repurposing existing drugs is an attractive option because these medications have undergone extensive testing, allowing them to move quickly into clinical trials and accelerating their potential approval for COVID-19 treatment,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “Although there is anecdotal evidence that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may benefit people with COVID-19, we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes.”

As of May 13, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 4.17 million cases of and 287,399 deaths from COVID-19 worldwide. In the United States, 1.36 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 82,246 deaths have been reported as of May 13, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Currently, there are no specific therapeutics approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people with COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine is FDA-approved to prevent and treat malaria, as well as to treat the autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Some preliminary reports have suggested that hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with the FDA-approved antibiotic azithromycin, may benefit people with COVID-19. Numerous clinical trials are planned or underway, including a recently launched study supported by NIH’s National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute evaluating the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of adults hospitalized with COVID-19. On March 28, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow hydroxychloroquine and medical-grade chloroquine to be distributed from the Strategic National Stockpile and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized adolescents and adults with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible.

Participants in the ACTG study, called A5395, will receive oral medications to take at home. Those randomly assigned to the experimental treatment group will take 400 milligrams (mg) of hydroxychloroquine twice on the first day and 200 mg twice daily for an additional six days. They also will take 500 mg of azithromycin on the first day and 250 mg daily for an additional four days. The control group will receive equivalent numbers of placebo pills. Neither the participants nor the study team will know who received experimental treatment or placebo until the end of the trial.

Participants will record their symptoms, adherence to treatment, and major events such as hospitalizations in a diary for 20 days. Study staff will follow up with participants by telephone during this period. When possible, participants will come to the clinical research site for an in-person visit at day 20. Additional follow-ups will be conducted by telephone three and six months after treatment starts.

The main objective of the study is to determine whether hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can prevent hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. Additionally, investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the experimental treatment for people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are both considered safe in most people, they can cause side effects ranging from headache and nausea to, rarely, heart rhythm problems that can be life-threatening. Because of the risk of heart problems when hydroxychloroquine is used alone or combined with azithromycin, FDA cautions that use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 should be limited to clinical trials or for treating certain hospitalized patients under EUA so clinicians can monitor patients for adverse effects.

“This study will provide key data to aid responses to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said ACTG Chair Judith Currier, M.D., of the University of California, Los Angeles. “We are pleased to be able to leverage ACTG’s existing infrastructure for HIV treatment clinical trials to quickly implement this important study.”

The study team is led by Protocol Chair Davey Smith, M.D., of the University of California, San Diego. David Wohl, M.D., of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Kara W. Chew, M.D., and Eric S. Daar, M.D., both of the University of California, Los Angeles, serve as protocol vice-chairs. The trial is expected to enroll quickly given the high incidence of COVID-19, and initial results may be available later this year.

NIAID

What

A harmonized and collaborative approach to the clinical testing, scale-up and distribution of candidate vaccines to prevent COVID-19 is essential, scientific leaders write in a perspective published today in Science. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, government, industry and academia have introduced a variety of vaccine candidates. The authors note that more than one effective vaccine approach likely will be required to successfully protect the global community from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. They describe a strategic approach to research and development that would generate essential data for multiple vaccine candidates in parallel.

National Institutes of Health Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., Lawrence Corey, M.D., professor in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and John R. Mascola, M.D., director of NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center are the co-authors of the commentary.

The perspective discusses diverse vaccine candidates and key considerations for development, including the characteristics of various vaccine platforms in terms of prior commercial experience, scalability, and the types of immune responses generated. It also emphasizes that no single vaccine or vaccine platform is likely to meet the global need, highlighting the need for a coordinated strategic approach to vaccine development.

The authors stress that researchers need to learn more about what constitutes a durable protective immune response against COVID-19. They review considerations for vaccine efficacy trials, explaining how trials for several candidate vaccines can be conducted in parallel to generate essential safety and efficacy data and accelerate the licensure and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. The authors propose specific approaches to harmonizing the clinical testing of multiple vaccine products, including using common clinical trials designs, clinical endpoints, standardized immune assays and a common Data Safety and Monitoring Board.

The authors emphasize that developing COVID-19 vaccines will require unprecedented cooperation from governments, academic institutions, industry, and global philanthropic partners. The ACTIV (Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines) public-private partnership spearheaded by NIH aims to facilitate such collaboration with discussions and collaborations on trial designs and data sharing.

Protecting the entire global community from COVID-19 through vaccination will require significant manufacturing capacity, according to the authors. They emphasize the need to fund the necessary biomanufacturing infrastructure and note possible hurdles in the eventual delivery of vaccines, including cost, distribution systems and cold chain requirements. The authors conclude that strategic collaboration among public and private sectors to effectively accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development is essential.

NIH clinical trial testing antiviral remdesivir plus anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib for COVID-19 begins,"NIH clinical trial testing antiviral remdesivir plus anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib for COVID-19 begins

NIAID

A randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a treatment regimen of the investigational antiviral remdesivir plus the anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun. The trial is now enrolling hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in the United States. The trial is expected to open at approximately 100 U.S. and international sites. Investigators currently anticipate enrolling more than 1,000 participants. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is sponsoring the trial.

The clinical trial is the next iteration of NIAID’s Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT), which began on Feb. 21 to evaluate remdesivir, an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. That trial closed to enrollment on April 19 after recruiting 1,063 participants at 47 U.S. and 21 international sites. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) overseeing the trial met on April 27 and shared their preliminary analysis with the study sponsor, NIAID. Their analysis showed that patients who received remdesivir had a statistically significant shorter time to recovery compared to patients who received placebo. More detailed information about the trial results, including more comprehensive data, will be available in a forthcoming report. In this next trial with baricitinib, called ACTT 2, all participants will receive remdesivir or remdesivir with baricitinib.

“We now have solid data showing that remdesivir diminishes to a modest degree the time to recovery for people hospitalized with COVID-19,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “ACTT 2 will examine if adding an anti-inflammatory agent to the remdesivir regimen can provide additional benefit for patients, including improving mortality outcomes.”

Baricitinib, a product licensed to Eli Lilly and Company by Incyte and marketed under the brand name Olumiant, is approved in the U.S. and in more than 65 additional countries as a treatment for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Some people with COVID-19 experience acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in which inflammation of the lungs leads to shortness of breath and rapid breathing. Baricitinib, taken orally, inhibits cytokine signaling in the body that play roles in causing inflammatory responses. The putative benefit of baricitinib for COVID-19 has been described in a case series of critically ill patients who recovered from COVID-19. The combination of remdesivir and baricitinib for COVID-19 has not been evaluated in a large, randomized controlled treatment trial.

In accordance with standard clinical research protocols, eligible patients who provide informed consent will participate in ACTT 2. Participants in the trial must have laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and evidence of lung involvement, including a need for supplemental oxygen, abnormal chest X-rays, or illness requiring mechanical ventilation. Individuals with confirmed infection who have mild symptoms, or no apparent symptoms, will not be included in the study. Eligible study participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 to a treatment arm:

Arm 1: participants receive baricitinib tablets orally and intravenous (IV) remdesivir

Arm 2: participants receive placebo tablets orally and IV remdesivir

The study is double-blind, meaning neither trial investigators nor participants know who is receiving which treatment regimen. Remdesivir is administered as one 200-milligram (mg) IV dose followed by a 100-mg once-daily IV dose for the duration of hospitalization up to a 10-day total course of treatment. Baricitinib is administered as a 4-mg oral dose (or crushed and given through a nasogastric tube, if necessary) for the duration of hospitalization up to a 14-day total course of treatment. The placebo tablets resemble baricitinib but contain only inactive ingredients.

Investigators will evaluate whether time to recovery is shorter in the combination arm (baricitinib plus remdesivir), relative to remdesivir alone. Recovery is defined as the participant being well enough for hospital discharge, meaning the participant either no longer requires supplemental oxygen or ongoing medical care in the hospital, or is no longer hospitalized (with or without some limitation on activities). Recovery is evaluated up until day 29. A key secondary goal of the study is to compare patient outcomes at day 15 using an ordinal eight-point scale ranging from fully recovered to death. The trial will also compare other secondary outcome variables between treatment groups, including mortality alone.

An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will monitor ongoing results to ensure patient well-being and safety as well as study integrity.

NIH-supported research survey to examine impact of COVID-19 on rare diseases community,"NIH-supported research survey to examine impact of COVID-19 on rare diseases community

NIAID

For the millions of people living with a rare disease, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 presents challenges, from potential reduced access to needed medical care to possible heightened anxiety and stress. A new online survey launched by the National Institutes of Health-supported Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) aims to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers. Results will help the rare disease research community shed light on the needs of people with rare diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and other potential health crises, in addition to informing future research efforts.

The RDCRN, led by NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), in collaboration with nine other NIH Institutes and Centers, currently is made up of 20 recently funded clinical research consortia focused on better understanding how rare diseases progress and developing improved approaches for diagnosis and treatment. Scientists from different disciplines at hundreds of clinical sites around the world work together with about 140 patient advocacy groups to study more than 200 rare diseases, including immune system disorders, heart, lung and kidney disorders, brain development diseases and more.

“As a leader in fostering innovative, collaborative clinical research to improve the lives of individuals with rare diseases, the RDCRN is uniquely positioned to carry out a survey like this,” said Anne Pariser, M.D., director of the NCATS Office of Rare Diseases Research, which oversees the RDCRN. “The network has the necessary infrastructure, disease expertise, and access to patients through patient organizations to find answers to important questions.”

Though individually rare, affecting only a few hundred to several thousand people, rare diseases collectively affect an estimated 30 million people in the United States. Many rare diseases are life-threatening, and about half of those affected are children.

The research survey, developed and led by the RDCRN Data Management and Coordinating Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, is one of the first efforts nationwide to quantify the impact of a health crisis on the rare disease community. It is seeking responses from at least 5,000 people with a rare disease or caring for someone who has a rare disease. The survey will be distributed online to participants. In addition, some RDCRN-funded scientists plan to incorporate survey results into natural history studies, which follow patients to chart the progression and course of a disease. The survey is open to anyone with a rare disease, along with family and caregivers, and is not limited to the diseases studied within the RDCRN.

The impetus for the survey began through conversations among network researchers and patient advocacy organizations. Patients, families and caregivers were worried about how COVID-19 might affect them.

“People affected by a rare disease, and families and caregivers, initially asked how to avoid the virus,” said RDCRN Program Director Tiina Urv, Ph.D. “Then they became concerned about access to medicines and maintaining medical care during the pandemic, and the status of clinical trials. They were concerned about meeting the medical challenges that they face every day. We were hearing enough anecdotally that we wanted to get a clearer picture of the problem.”

As consortia scientists and clinicians engaged with patient groups and patients, sharing information and advice, a plan came together over several weeks to conduct a scientific research study to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on those in the rare disease community.

Questions in the research survey focus on a range of topics, from a patient’s ability to get proper care for a rare disease or condition to mental and emotional health. The survey asks what their concerns are as a person with a rare disease, or as family members and caregivers. Groups of people with different rare diseases and the community will have different needs and concerns, whether it is how to get needed medications or physical therapy to navigating an emergency room in a medical crisis.

“We hope the study questionnaire will help us better estimate the proportion of rare disease patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and find out how they are affected whether or not they had COVID-19,” said project principal investigator Maurizio Macaluso, M.D., Dr.P.H. at Cincinnati Children’s. “This survey provides an opportunity for the rare disease community to get timely data on the challenges they face.”

The researchers also think the survey data may help them tease out answers to many other questions. For example, do some subgroups of people with rare disease fare better or worse with the virus? Are certain individuals more prone to infection because of their underlying rare condition or disease?

Ultimately, the researchers hope the survey will help determine how the RDCRN can respond to the rare disease community’s concerns by providing information and advice through its network of medical experts and patient advocacy groups.

“This survey is a great example of how the consortia and patient groups are working together as a network to make a difference for the entire rare disease community,” Urv said.

Study to determine incidence of novel coronavirus infection in U.S. children begins,"Study to determine incidence of novel coronavirus infection in U.S. children begins

NIH-funded study also will ascertain percentage of infected children who develop COVID-19.

NIAID

A study to help determine the rate of novel coronavirus infection in children and their family members in the United States has begun enrolling participants. The study, called Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS), also will help determine what percentage of children infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, develop symptoms of the disease. In addition, the HEROS study will examine whether rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection differ between children who have asthma or other allergic conditions and children who do not. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is sponsoring and funding the HEROS study.

“One interesting feature of this novel coronavirus pandemic is that very few children have become sick with COVID-19 compared to adults,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “Is this because children are resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2, or because they are infected but do not develop symptoms? The HEROS study will help us begin to answer these and other key questions.”

The HEROS study team will rapidly enroll 6,000 people from 2,000 U.S. families already participating in NIH-funded pediatric research studies in 11 cities. Study participants will include both healthy children and children with asthma or other allergic conditions. The study team will prospectively follow these children and their families for six months to determine who gets infected with SARS-CoV-2, whether the virus is transmitted to other family members, and which family members with the virus develop COVID-19.

Leading the HEROS study is Tina V. Hartert, M.D., M.P.H. Dr. Hartert is director of the Center for Asthma and Environmental Sciences Research, vice president for translational research, the Lulu H. Owen Chair in Medicine and a professor of medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.

“So far, data on the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the U.S. population have been limited to people who physically interact with the healthcare system: those who are tested―especially those who test positive―and those with severe disease,” said Dr. Hartert. “These data provide real-time guidance in a setting of limited test availability, but they don’t enable us to understand the full extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the entire population. The HEROS study will help fill this knowledge gap and inform public health interventions.”

Preliminary evidence suggests that having an allergic condition paradoxically may reduce a person’s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease. A NIAID-funded study recently examined upper and lower airway cells for the expression of ACE2, the gene that codes for the receptor that the coronavirus uses to infect cells. ACE2 expression is necessary for a cell to make this receptor, but additional steps also are involved. In both children and adults, respiratory allergy, asthma and controlled allergen exposure were associated with significantly reduced ACE2 expression. The expression of ACE2 was lowest in people with high levels of both asthma and sensitivity to allergens.

The HEROS study will further clarify whether reduced ACE2 gene expression in airway cells of children with allergic diseases correlates with a lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.

The study will be conducted completely remotely. Every two weeks, a caregiver in participating families will collect nasal swabs from the child who is the primary study participant and all other family members who are enrolled in the study, and will mail the samples to a laboratory for analysis. On the same day as the nasal swab, the caregiver will complete online questionnaires about each participant’s current symptoms, social distancing practices, recent activities outside the home, and recent exposure to people who are sick.

In addition, if any member of the household develops symptoms of a viral illness, the caregiver will fill out another online questionnaire designed to determine the likelihood that the illness is COVID-19. If COVID-19 is likely, the caregiver will collect nasal swabs from all study participants and a stool sample from the symptomatic participant within 24 hours.

Laboratory analyses of nasal swabs will test for SARS-CoV-2 and assess gene expression in the collected airway-surface cells. Investigators hope that these gene expression studies will reveal patterns that correlate with higher or lower risk of infection, COVID-19 symptom development and SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

A caregiver also will collect a blood sample from each study participant two weeks, 18 weeks and 24 weeks after enrollment as well as three weeks after the family’s first likely case of COVID-19, if there is one. The blood will be collected using a new, nearly painless device that extracts a small quantity of blood through the surface of the skin. The blood will be analyzed for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 once an appropriate antibody test becomes available.

"COVID-19–Associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children — United States, March–July 2020","On August 7, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

Distinguishing MIS-C from other severe infectious or inflammatory conditions poses a challenge to clinicians caring for children and adolescents. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand in many jurisdictions, health care provider awareness of MIS-C will facilitate early recognition, early diagnosis, and prompt treatment.

Most cases of MIS-C have features of shock, with cardiac involvement, gastrointestinal symptoms, and significantly elevated markers of inflammation, with positive laboratory test results for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 565 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, all had a positive test result by RT-PCR or serology.

In April 2020, during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe, a cluster of children with hyperinflammatory shock with features similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome was reported in England* (1). The patients’ signs and symptoms were temporally associated with COVID-19 but presumed to have developed 2–4 weeks after acute COVID-19; all children had serologic evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). The clinical signs and symptoms present in this first cluster included fever, rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and elevated markers of inflammation and cardiac damage (1). On May 14, 2020, CDC published an online Health Advisory that summarized the manifestations of reported multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), outlined a case definition,† and asked clinicians to report suspected U.S. cases to local and state health departments. As of July 29, a total of 570 U.S. MIS-C patients who met the case definition had been reported to CDC. A total of 203 (35.6%) of the patients had a clinical course consistent with previously published MIS-C reports, characterized predominantly by shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers, and almost all had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. The remaining 367 (64.4%) of MIS-C patients had manifestations that appeared to overlap with acute COVID-19 (2–4), had a less severe clinical course, or had features of Kawasaki disease.§ Median duration of hospitalization was 6 days; 364 patients (63.9%) required care in an intensive care unit (ICU), and 10 patients (1.8%) died. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand in many jurisdictions, clinicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of MIS-C and report suspected cases to their state or local health departments; analysis of reported cases can enhance understanding of MIS-C and improve characterization of the illness for early detection and treatment.

Local and state health departments reported suspected MIS-C patients to CDC using CDC’s MIS-C case report form, which included information on patient demographics, clinical findings, and laboratory test results. Patients who met the MIS-C case definition and were reported to CDC as of July 29, 2020, were included in the analysis. Latent class analysis (LCA), a statistical modeling technique that can divide cases into groups by underlying similarities, was used to identify and describe differing manifestations in patients who met the MIS-C case definition. The indicator variables used in the LCA were the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2–positive test results by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serology, shock, pneumonia, and involvement of organ systems (i.e., cardiovascular, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic, renal, or respiratory). Three-class LCA was conducted using the R software package “poLCA” with 100 iterations to identify the optimal classification scheme (5). Clinical and demographic variables were reported for patients by LCA class. Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare proportions of categorical variables; numeric variables, with medians and interquartile ranges, were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test.

As of July 29, 2020, a total of 570 MIS-C patients with onset dates from March 2 to July 18, 2020, had been reported from 40 state health departments, the District of Columbia, and New York City (Figure). The median patient age was 8 years (range = 2 weeks–20 years); 55.4% were male, 40.5% were Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), 33.1% were non-Hispanic black (black), and 13.2% non-Hispanic white (white) (Table 1). Obesity was the most commonly reported underlying medical condition, occurring in 30.5% of Hispanic, 27.5% of black, and 6.6% of white MIS-C patients.

Overall, the illness in 490 (86.0%) patients involved four or more organ systems. Approximately two thirds did not have preexisting underlying medical conditions before MIS-C onset. The most common signs and symptoms reported during illness course were abdominal pain (61.9%), vomiting (61.8%), skin rash (55.3%), diarrhea (53.2%), hypotension (49.5%), and conjunctival injection (48.4%). Most patients had gastrointestinal (90.9%), cardiovascular (86.5%), or dermatologic or mucocutaneous (70.9%) involvement. Substantial numbers of MIS-C patients had severe complications, including cardiac dysfunction (40.6%), shock (35.4%), myocarditis (22.8%), coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm (18.6%), and acute kidney injury (18.4%). The majority of patients (63.9%) were admitted to an ICU. The median length of ICU stay was 5 days (interquartile range = 3–7 days).

Of the 565 (99.1%) patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, all had a positive test result by RT-PCR or serology; 46.1% had only serologic evidence of infection and 25.8% had only positive RT-PCR test results. Five patients (0.9%) did not have testing performed but had an epidemiologic link as indicated in the MIS-C case definition.

Among all 570 patients, 527 (92.5%) were treated, including 424 (80.5%) who received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 331 (62.8%) who received steroids, 309 (58.6%) who received antiplatelet medication, 233 (44.2%) who received anticoagulation medication, and 221 (41.9%) who were treated with vasoactive medication. Ten (1.8%) patients were reported to have died (Table 1).

LCA identified three classes of patients, each of which had significantly different illness manifestations related to some of the key indicator variables. Class 1 represented 203 (35.6%) patients who had the highest number of involved organ systems. Within this group, 99 (48.8%) had involvement of six or more organ systems; those most commonly affected were cardiovascular (100.0%) and gastrointestinal (97.5%). Compared with the other classes, patients in class 1 had significantly higher prevalences of abdominal pain, shock, myocarditis, lymphopenia, markedly elevated C-reactive protein (produced in the liver in response to inflammation), ferritin (an acute-phase reactant), troponin (a protein whose presence in the blood indicates possible cardiac damage), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), or proBNP (indicative of heart failure) (p<0.01) (Tables 1 and 2). Almost all class 1 patients (98.0%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology test results with or without positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results. These cases closely resembled MIS-C without overlap with acute COVID-19 or Kawasaki disease.

Class 2 included 169 (29.6%) patients; among those in this group, 129 (76.3%) had respiratory system involvement. These patients were significantly more likely to have cough, shortness of breath, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), indicating that their illnesses might have been primarily acute COVID-19 or a combination of acute COVID-19 and MIS-C. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity (without seropositivity) in this group (84.0%) was significantly higher than that for class 1 (0.5%) or class 3 (2.0%) patients (p<0.01). The case fatality rate among class 2 patients was the highest (5.3%) among all three classes (p<0.01).

Class 3 included 198 (34.7%) patients; the median age of children in this group (6 years) was younger than that of the class 1 patients (9 years) or class 2 patients (10 years) (p<0.01) (Table 1). Class 3 patients also had the highest prevalence of rash (62.6%), and mucocutaneous lesions (44.9%). Although not statistically significant (p = 0.49), the prevalence of coronary artery aneurysm and dilatations (18.2%) was higher than that in class 2 patients (15.8%), but lower than that in class 1 patients (21.1%). Class 3 patients more commonly met criteria for complete Kawasaki disease (6.6%) compared with class 1 (4.9%) and class 2 (3.0%) patients (p = 0.30), and had the lowest prevalence of underlying medical conditions, organ system involvement, complications (e.g., shock, myocarditis), and markers of inflammation and cardiac damage. Among class 3 patients, 63.1% had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology only and 33.8% had both serologic confirmation and positive RT-PCR results.",8/13/20 0:00,

"Scientists worried the pandemic would cause malaria deaths to soar. So far, it hasn’t happened","Scientists worried the pandemic would cause malaria deaths to soar. So far, it hasn’t happened

Science ’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Pulitzer Center and the Heising-Simons Foundation.

Back in March when COVID-19 hit, Pedro Alonso became alarmed about a different infectious disease. “I thought I would be witnessing the biggest malaria disaster in 20 years,” says Alonso, a malaria scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO). African countries went on lockdown to curtail COVID-19; worried about mass gatherings, they suspended campaigns to distribute mosquito-fighting bed nets. Fears abounded that with clinics overwhelmed by COVID-19, patients would be unable to get treatment for malaria, which kills an estimated 405,000 per year, mostly African children. In the worst case scenario, models projected, malaria deaths could more than double this year.

“It does not seem to be happening,” Alonso says. Lobbied hard by WHO’s Global Malaria Programme (GMP), which he heads, and its partners, countries resumed bed net campaigns. Rapid diagnostic tests and effective malaria drugs are available. The situation could still go south as the COVID-19 epidemic accelerates—there are worrying signs—but for now, Alonso says, “We probably stopped the first big blow.”

In March, WHO recommended that countries halt mass vaccination campaigns for measles and other diseases, fearing they might spread COVID-19. Like other health agencies, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advised people to stay home unless they were very, very sick, Alonso says. But a broad lockdown would be “a bullet straight to the heart of the malaria program,” he says. “For the past 40 years we have been saying that malaria can kill very quickly. If a child has fever … go straight to the clinic.”

By 25 March, WHO had issued emergency guidance telling countries they should proceed with malaria prevention and treatment—and could do so safely. “WHO was very effective in getting the message out,” says Thomas Churcher of Imperial College London (ICL), who published an alarming model about the effects of scaling back malaria interventions in Nature Medicine on 7 August.

The distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets was GMP’s first concern. The recent plunge in malaria deaths, from an estimated 839,000 in 2000 to 405,000 in 2018, happened largely thanks to the massive net rollout across Africa. But bed nets need to be replaced every 3 years, as the insecticide wears off and nets tear. Twenty-six African countries were scheduled to distribute new nets in mass campaigns this year—but in March, many were wary.

Benin was the most urgent priority. It had already completed the first phase of its campaign, distributing vouchers door to door that families could use to pick up their bed nets from a central point 1 month later. But the government had canceled the second phase. The concern was that people, worried about supplies, would rush to distribution centers to pick up their nets, says Marcy Erskine of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “Crowds can be very difficult to control,” she says, making physical distancing all but impossible.

“We all knew if Benin did not go ahead, there would be a massive domino effect” on other countries, Erskine says. So GMP and its partners—including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative, and the Alliance for Malaria Prevention (AMP)—started to lobby leaders in Benin and elsewhere, she says, armed with models from ICL and WHO. AMP advised countries on how to reduce COVID-19 risks—for instance, by distributing nets door-to-door instead of from a central point—and offered technical assistance to do so.

Benin agreed, distributing 8 million nets in April and setting an example for other governments, says Sussann Nasr of the Global Fund: “In the end, every country said yes.” Still, “We don’t want to get a false sense of security,” Nasr says. “We have to be sure that the 2021 countries do their campaigns, too,” says Hannah Slater, a modeler at PATH, a global health nonprofit in Seattle. The same holds for indoor spraying with insecticides and seasonal chemoprevention, in which children are given antimalaria drugs during the disease’s high season, regardless of whether they are infected.

Even if preventive interventions continue, malaria deaths could soar if sick children don’t receive effective treatment—if, for instance, frightened mothers keep them home, as happened during the West African Ebola epidemic. The ICL model projects that if access to treatment drops by 50% for just 6 months, 129,000 additional malaria deaths would occur between May 2020 and May 2021.

Getting a fix on how many children are being treated is tough, Alonso says. But there are ominous hints. Antenatal visits are down in some places, and that’s where pregnant women, who are very vulnerable to severe malaria, receive chemoprevention and bed nets along with regular checkups. Other data show routine immunizations for diseases such as measles have fallen off. “What I really worry about is a child who won’t be treated and deaths will go uncounted,” says Regina Rabinovich of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health—a problem even before the pandemic. Undercounting probably explains the “paradoxical” finding that reported malaria cases are down this year, Alonso says.

Churcher fears some countries may see COVID-19 peak during the high malaria season, leaving fragile health systems dealing with simultaneous epidemics. Even countries that go into strict lockdown must continue malaria services, he says: “It’s not a trade-off. You have to do both.”",2020-08-17 14:00:00-04:00,
National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week: Get the Facts – and Get Your Home and Child Tested,"U.S. health, housing, and environmental agencies warn that some 3.6 million U.S. families risk permanent harm to their children because their homes are contaminated with lead-based paint.

That’s why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has joined the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other public and private partners to urge Americans to learn the facts about lead poisoning and have their homes and children tested during National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week, from October 25-31.

Lead poisoning remains a danger in American homes, often hiding in plain sight in lead-based paint. Protecting children from exposure to lead is important to lifelong good health. There is no safe blood lead level in children. Even low levels of lead in blood affect a child’s IQ, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement. And the toxic effects of lead exposure are irreversible.

“As we observe National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week, we urge people to take action,” said Patrick Breysse, PhD, CIH, Director of CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health. “Together, we can eliminate childhood lead poisoning as a public health problem by strengthening blood lead testing, reporting, and surveillance, while linking exposed children to recommended services. CDC is committed to help address this threat and improve health outcomes for our nation’s most vulnerable citizens – our children.”

Some children at higher risk of lead poisoning

Any child can be exposed to lead, but some children are at higher risk. Lower income families and those who live in homes built before 1978 with original leaded paint are among those at highest risk. Other common factors for risk include living near industrial facilities that work with lead, recently emigrating from countries with high levels of lead in the environment, and exposure to lead-containing products such as antique cookware and leaded crystal glassware.

Testing blood lead levels is the best way to tell if a child has been exposed to lead poisoning. As states develop plans for reopening following the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers are encouraged to work with families to bring children up to date with testing. Children covered by Medicaid are eligible for free testing.

CDC advises parents to seek a blood lead test if they suspect their children have been exposed to lead. But the most important step that parents, doctors, and others can take is to prevent lead exposure before it occurs.

CDC Media Telebriefing Transcript on Operation Warp Speed,"[Dr. Robert Redfield]

Are you mine? Ok great.

Good afternoon and thank you Secretary Azar for joining us today at CDC headquarters. It’s a privilege to have you with us and we appreciate your leadership throughout this unprecedented response.

COVID-19 is the most significant public health challenge our country’s faced in more than a century and the pandemic is not over. Earlier this week COVID virus cases reached over 40 million globally. Here in the United States, we’re approaching a critical phase. In a few moments Dr. Jay Butler, CDC’s Deputy Director for Infectious Diseases and the former incident manager of the CDC’s COVID-19 response, will provide you a brief update on our current domestic situation.

I know it’s been a difficult year for Americans, but we are going to come through this on the other side. I’m also optimistic that we’ll have a limited supply of one or more COVID vaccines available for distribution before the end of this year but we’re not quite there yet. That is why it’s so important that all of us remain diligent in our efforts to defeat this virus and to protect ourselves, our families, and our communities. At CDC, science, data, and service have driven our unprecedented response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our mission is to protect the health of every American and save lives. Personally, I’m incredibly proud of the men and women at CDC and it’s truly been an honor for me to lead them during these extraordinary times and to lead these extraordinary people.

I would like now to introduce Dr. Jay Butler who will make remarks and then followed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and then we’ll be happy to take your questions. Jay.

[Dr. Jay Butler]

Good afternoon everybody. Thank you for being here it’s fabulous to be able to speak to you today and thank you for that introduction Dr. Redfield. We’re here to give you the latest on what’s going on with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unfortunately, we’re seeing a distressing trend here in the United States with COVID-19 cases increasing in nearly 75 percent of the country. To date, we’ve confirmed over 8.1 million cases and sadly over 220 thousand deaths since January. I know these are numbers, but these are also people and we mourn these losses. The past week we’ve seen nearly sixty thousand cases a day on average as well as 700 deaths. Here in Georgia, we’ve also seen an increase in the number of cases despite the decline that we had experienced beginning in August.

And we’re also seeing cases increase in really all parts of the country in the Midwest particularly likely in part because people are moving indoors with the arrival of cooler temperatures. Another factor is that smaller more intimate gatherings of family, friends and neighbors may be driving infection as well especially as these gatherings move indoors and adherence to face coverings and social distancing may not be optimal. I recognize that we are all getting tired of the impact that COVID-19 has had on our lives. We get tired of wearing masks but it continues to be as important as it’s ever been and I would say it’s more important than ever as we move into the fall season.

It’s incredibly important to continue these steps also as we look towards the upcoming holidays. We know that every activity that involves interacting with others has some degree of risk right now. There are four general rules of thumb for assessing risk and deciding how to best protect yourself and those you love.

First, the more closely you interact with others.

Second, the longer the interaction asks.

Third, if the interaction is indoors rather than outdoors.

And fourth, interactions with the greatest number of people translate into the higher risks of COVID19 spread.

Understanding these risks and how to adapt different prevention measures can help you protect yourselves and your families and your communities. We all want to live as safely as we can and minimize the risk of COVID-19 while it is circulating. Secretary Azar will highlight what people can do to protect themselves, but I want to spend a few minutes talking about an additional tool we’ll likely have very soon. The COVID-19 vaccines that Dr. Redfield mentioned. We’re cautiously optimistic that vaccine will be available although likely in limited quantities before the end of 2020. Preparing for implementing a successful COVID-19 vaccine program is a crucial next step as part of our overall effort to protect Americans, reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and continue to restore more normalcy to our lives and our country.

CDC is a proud part of Operation Warp Speed, the partnership between parts of HHS and the Department of Defense, to develop, make, and distribute millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses as quickly as possible while ensuring that they are safe and effective. In other words we want to make sure they work. I’m pleased to announce that all jurisdictions including Georgia have submitted their initial vaccine program plans. These plans are an important milestone in our efforts to ensure successful delivery and administration of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to the ultimate goal that everyone who wants to be immunized can be. Over the past month CDC has provided technical assistance to each jurisdiction including nearly daily check-ins with jurisdictional staff, weekly conference calls with immunization and preparedness managers, and in some cases on-site assistance.

My colleagues are currently conducting a thorough review of the draft plans we’ll be providing feedback to the jurisdiction during the next two weeks it’s important to recognize that these plans are flexible because things may change as we learn more about which vaccines become available and what amounts and when. Additionally each plan will include an executive summary that we plan to post online later this month allowing for maximal transparency and a general understanding of each jurisdiction’s approach.

I want to highlight also the pharmacy partnership we announced last week with CVS and Walgreens. Again we anticipate that initially the vaccine will be available in a limited supply and when the limited when the supply of vaccine is limited our efforts to vaccinate may need to focus on those who are at highest risk of severe disease as well as those critical to the response including those who provide care to people in the health care system. People at risk include those in long-term care facilities like nursing homes and assisting living facilities as well as independent living facilities. The Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program provides end-to-end management of the COVID-19 vaccination process including getting vaccines to facilities. It provides for on-site vaccinations and fulfillment of all reporting requirements. Long-term care facilities will have the option of partnering with CVS in Walgreens whose combined national footprint will allow most facilities nationwide to opt into this program.

Before I close, I want to remind you that tomorrow the vaccine and related biological products advisory committee is meeting to discuss the latest COVID-19 vaccine development and next week the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will be meeting. Both of these meetings independent committees will be broadcast live for the public to see the data that is being discussed as well as the process that’s being used to ensure that Americans have a safe and effective variety of COVID-19 vaccines.

We know that stopping this pandemic is going to take all of our tools: hand washing, masks, social distancing, and hopefully quite soon vaccines. Taken together these tools are our best chance of getting our communities, schools, and health systems back into normal operations.

I’d like to turn the podium over at this point to Alex Azar. Secretary Azar, thank you for being here.

[Secretary Alex Azar]

Well thank you so much Dr. Butler and Dr. Redfield and thanks to everybody at CDC for hosting us here today. It’s an honor to be here to express my gratitude to the incredibly hard-working team here at CDC for their efforts throughout this pandemic. While in Atlanta I’ve also had the chance to learn about the heroic efforts of the health care providers, the janitorial staff, everybody, at Grady Memorial Hospital as well as Emory University’s hospital’s work on clinical trials for Regeneron’s antibody cocktail and Moderna’s candidate vaccine. Thanks to how we designed Operation Warp Speed, if and when the FDA gives the go-ahead for these therapeutic and vaccine products we will have supplies already manufactured and ready for distribution. In conjunction with Operation Warp Speed, the CDC as Dr. Butler mentioned is leading the effort to coordinate vaccine distribution and administration working with the 64 public health jurisdictions they partner with on vaccines each year. I want to offer a special thank you to every American who has volunteered for COVID-19 clinical trials or helped raise awareness especially among diverse communities where we need representation in our clinical trials. Anyone interested in signing up for a vaccine trial can visit Coronavirus.gov and for therapeutic trials go to RiseAboveCovid.org. While we make this exciting progress on vaccines and therapeutics we see concerning trends in many parts of the country as Dr. Butler explained.

I’m briefed with the latest data from across the country by CDC’s career experts each and every morning. There is hope on the way in the form of safe and effective vaccines in a matter of weeks or months. But in the meantime, to bridge to that next phase we have to take steps that can keep ourselves our families and our communities safe. Those are the three W’s:

Wash your hands,

Watch your distance,

Wear your face covering when you can’t watch your distance.

And avoid settings where you can’t do those things. Thank you all for joining us here today, thank you to the American people for the incredible sacrifices that you have made throughout this pandemic, and thank you to again to the dedicated team here at CDC for their incredibly hard work.

We’re not happy to take some questions. Yeah.

[Questioner]

Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Last week, Emory University’s Dean of Public Health called your agency’s undermining of the CDC under president trump unforgivable, called the president’s leadership anti-science. Dr. Butler, I believe, was quoted in ProPublica as saying he was deeply concerned that actions the agency was forced to take would cost lives. Have you discussed any of that in your conversations today since all this was in the last week and do you have any concerns about the allegations?

[Secretary Azar]

Well I’m not going to talk about my discussions internal here within CDC what did I come down here to do I came down here to thank the incredible people of the CDC for their work. We talked about the most recent data around the efficacy and importance of wearing face coverings. We talked about the vaccine planning work around distribution of vaccines and I got an update about the incredible progress CDC is making on increasing the data submissions from nursing homes into the national health safety network. In terms of the question that you asked let me be really clear the CDC is the premier epidemiological organization on the face of the planet. When we go to other countries as I often did before the COVID pandemic they literally are named the blank centers for disease control and prevention named after this very institution. So this is a crown jewel of American and global public health. We revere it. But CDC plays a role in what is a very unique, unprecedented pandemic. It has been 100 years, as Dr. Redfield noted, since we have had a public health crisis of this type. This is bigger than H1N1. This is not SARS this is not MERS. This is something that impacts the entire government and the entire economy. CDC plays a very important role in that. But it plays a role of public health and epidemiology. There are other key players even within my department substance abuse mental health services agency with important equities around mental health, opioid abuse during the pandemic, NIH and FDA around research and countermeasures, veterans department around care for our veterans, the defense department around force protection, transportation, DHS around transportation issues, international commerce, the state department, international relations, spread of disease globally. So the CDC plays a very important and vital role but in a pandemic of this scope, size, and magnitude, it plays a role, not just the role and I think some of the people who comment are not having actually lived in or led in this organization during this type of a crisis failing to appreciate that. But make no mistake the CDC is a science and evidence-led organization we respect CDC’s science and evidence conclusions what comes out of CDC at the end of the day is Dr. Redfield’s conclusions around science and evidence with the support of his team. And that’s how we operate and that’s how we’re going to keep operating. Yes

[Questioner]

The CDC guideline that talks about what a contact is it now says that it is being within six feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes or more and also there’s reporting that there’s an effort to CDC to shorten the isolation of quarantine time for school children, can you talk about that?

[Director Redfield]

Sure, thank you very much for the question. I think just to take the big picture as we said before CDC is science-based and data-driven and as a consequence as we get more data and understand the science of COVID we’re going to continue to incorporate that in our recommendations. Originally contact as you know that was considered to be high risk for potential exposure to COVID was someone within six feet that was for more than 15 minutes. There is some recent data that has been determined an individual who had a series of shorter contacts but over time added up to more than 15 minutes became infected, in clarifying that new science that new data into our contact recommendation is what you’re alluding to and again it’s based on data that one didn’t have four months ago but it is data now that we have based on situations recorded. The second part of your question, could you say it again for a second. (OVERTALK) For the effort in quarantine. So again as you know the data that we have right now, that’s in play, is that individuals who have had a high-risk exposure have a period of time after that when they actually become detectable for virus. Originally the average was a little more than five days and then then new data showed it was a little more than seven days. When you looked at the data collectively if you did the cut off at 14 days you actually identified almost everyone that was positive. If you tried to shorten it to 10 days we found that we missed around maybe 12 percent of people and so therefore we stayed at the 14 days. Now all of those decisions were made without testing so now there’s a series of studies gathering data that are trying to determine can you use testing during the quarantine to determine if you could shorten the quarantine from 14 days, to 10 days, or seven days. So again it’s data driven, it’s under evaluation, obviously we don’t want to have people be quarantined for you know 14 days unnecessarily. So we are working hard to see if there’s data now that we have testing that may allow us to be more confident that if we do testing at day five or day seven that we can use that information then more effectively understand that we could shorten the quarantine period. So it’s not a policy it’s basically an it’s an area of research where we’re gathering that data now.

[Unintelligible question]

Yeah if again I try to say this many times I get the opportunity. Science is a science-based data-driven service organization, CDC is. We’re not an opinion organization. So if we get data that supports the change in our recommendations then those recommendations will be changed.

[Secretary Azar]

Yes in the middle.

[Questioner]

(Unintelligible) 19 deaths could be much higher compared to I guess it would be a question for Dr. Redfield compared to or Butler in previous years I think we’re off nearly 300,000 deaths and I believe the CDC said two out of every three deaths is COVID related. Could you just talk about that?

[Deputy Director Butler]

Sure, so the concept of excess deaths is one that may sound a little cold but basically life is a sexually transmitted condition which is 100% fatal. So we know that all of us are going to die eventually. There is an expected periodicity to that. There is the average life expectancies. We know that at any time there’s a certain amount of seasonal variation also and this is something that we’ve looked at for years in terms of the number of excess deaths that are caused during an influenza season. Using that same type of methodology to look at what’s happened during the time of the COVID pandemic is how we’re able to come up with the fact that we know more people have died this year, we know that some people are going to die no matter what. But comparing the total number to that expected number leads to a difference that ultimately leads to the 300,000 excess deaths that you just mentioned. About two-thirds of those we can link directly to COVID-19. What about the other third – that’s as you know an important question to address as well. Some of those may be unrelated perhaps because of limitations on access to medical care. Some of them also may be unrecognized impacts of COVID-19. So when we look at factors like cardiovascular death that aren’t directly linked to COVID-19, there’s not a really great explanation for why we would see that increase in cardiovascular death and we know that it’s possible that COVID-19 could be playing a role in those deaths as well. And overall I think it emphasizes the importance of the prevention measures that we’ve been talking about.

[Questioner]

Dr. Butler you said that the vaccine could be available for distribution towards the end of the year I’m sorry um does that mean how widely and um how long do you think it could be before a vaccine is available for widespread distribution to anyone who needs it could that be march summer of 2021?

[Deputy Director Butler]

Sure I mean these are these are the questions that we are asking every day as we move forward with vaccine planning because as you’re aware there’s a number of different products that are currently in clinical trial. There’s a process to make sure that those vaccines are safe and effective that we have to go through as well and a number of the clinical trials are ongoing and still in a fairly early phase. So I wish we had a crystal ball so that we could look at it I wish I could say everything is going to go 100% according to plan but we also know that we have to be ready for if it doesn’t. I think looking at the current trends in the studies and the production of vaccines it’s reasonable to expect that we will have at least one possibly two products available before the end of the calendar year. The next question is okay that’s when and again no guarantees how much and that’s also part of the iterative process as we continue to learn what the production capacity will be going forward. One of the beauties of operation warp speed is we’re not waiting until we have all of the the studies completed and the reviews done before we start the production process. It may be that we find for instance that a vaccine is not effective and that’s a vaccine that ultimately is not going to be administered to Americans.

[Secretary Azar]

And if I could just in terms of your question around the timelines on quantities so as Dr. Butler mentioned we’ve got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which are very close to if not fully enrolled in their clinical trials when we get data out of those we’ll really be dependent on events in the trial. It’s outside of anyone’s control. We are as Dr. Butler mentioned concurrently manufacturing commercial scale production of all six of the vaccines that we have investments or contracts with including of course Pfizer and Moderna and we expect that we would have by the end of this year enough vaccine to be that is FDA authorized to be able to vaccinate all of our vulnerable into the most vulnerable individuals. Then by the end of January we expect we’d have enough to vaccinate all seniors as well as our health care workers and first responders and by the end of March to early April enough vaccine for all Americans who would want to take a vaccine. Let me we’ve got we have an overflow room because of abiding by CDC’s restrictions on number of people in the room could I ask you do we have anyone on the phone a question from the phone that has been asked we’ll turn over to the phone now if somebody has a question do we have Bloomberg on the phone please go ahead.

[Questioner]

Hi uh this is I’m a quote with Bloomberg um we were told by uh the leader of operation Warp speed today that Astra Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson trials are going to resume this week can you share any more about this as well as the nature of these safety concerns?

[Secretary Azar]

You broke up a great deal there I’ll try to I believe your question was regarding the status of the AstraZeneca vaccine clinical trials. So as of now within the United States, unless something has changed in the time since I’ve been standing here the AstraZeneca trial remains on clinical trial hold here in the United States because of uh the review by the FDA and the company uh as to a possible serious adverse event and what we do is the company as well as the FDA examined the data to determine when there’s a serious event is there a connection to the vaccine. Do we believe that’s a valid connection, a causative connection, and if so uh should the trial be restarted and continued or are there other precautions that one should take for instance modifying the informed consent forms, uh anything about the protocol that’s part of that. So the FDA has been working to gather uh data and information from uh AstraZeneca uh to make to assist it in that evaluation uh and as far as I know that process is continuing as we speak that will be a determination made by made by the FDA. One more, okay. yep can we see if the on the phone. Who do we have on the phone? Did we have fox on the phone?

[Questioner]

Secretary Azar thank you for taking our questions today? The president of the united states has held numerous rallies around the country many in the hottest of hot spots and most with no social distancing and little mask wearing. The president also says we are rounding the corner. In simple English sir are we rounding the corner and are these rallies a good idea? And the second part of my question sir is the president has also been critical of Dr. Fauci lately, what impact do you believe this will have as your department tries to distribute and convince Americans to take a vaccine that many surveys are now showing some Americans are skeptical about or concerned about taking?

[Secretary Azar]

So in terms of in terms of your first question uh listen our guidance is the same regardless of setting; wash your hands, watch your distance, wear your face covering when you can’t watch your distance, and avoid settings where you can’t do those things. For anybody reconnected to school, reconnected to work, going back to worship, or reconnecting to health care or engaging in the political and civic life of our country, our advice remains the same; which is wash your hands, watch your distance, wear face coverings when you can’t watch your distance, and avoid settings where you don’t where you aren’t going to be able to do those things. That that advice is the same regardless of any type of gathering. With regard to your second question the uh the president has assembled and has direct access to many different advisors including the people on this stage as well as others. I try to make sure from the beginning of this of this outbreak that the president is getting the best medical scientific advice from a diverse range of the top doctors uh within this department. And the president hears divergent viewpoints, the president’s made clear that he has great respect for Dr. Fauci and has a close relationship with Dr. Fauci he said that in follow-up from those other comments uh that should have no impact on the vaccine work that we do. The vaccine work that we’re doing the American people should feel very reassured by the process that is established here. There are five independent checks around vaccine regulation. First a vaccine clinical trial has pre-specified end points they’re statistical and actually these drug companies have been transparent for the first time in history laying out exactly what those statistical endpoints are. There is a totally independent data and safety monitoring board that will look at the data as it comes in determine if those endpoints have been met. If and only if those endpoints are met that data gets revealed to the company and the FDA. Then the company will have its own second independent process it will have to meet their ethical standards for submission of an application for either an emergency use authorization or a biologic license. Third it’ll come to the FDA where the FDA will evaluate that vaccine according to two sets of guidances it put out. Its general vaccine guidance for COVID and its second EUA guidance for what it would require and expect in terms of approval. Then you’ve got the fourth check which is as Dr. Butler mentioned the advisory committee at the FDA. An external advisory committee that will be webcast. A public external advisory process will advise the FDA. And then fifth the decision about whether to approve or authorize a vaccine at FDA will be made by FDA’s career scientists. So that’s five independent checks that combined with how this is working so far. Look at look at the fact that we have three clinical trials that have been put on hold because of any type of safety concern. The system’s working. This is being played by the book. So one antibody trial has been put on hold, two vaccine trials put on hold to ensure that FDA and we are putting patient safety at the center following all regulatory ethical standards for development of both therapeutics and vaccines. All of those elements of process should reassure the American people that when a vaccine or therapeutic comes out with the authorization or approval of FDA it represents FDA’s career scientists best judgment, that it meets their scientific evidence legal and regulatory standards. So, thank you all very much for coming today we Dr. Redfield and I’ve got to get to the airport but we really appreciate your being here today and Dr. Butler very much appreciate that. As I said Dr. Butler is the senior career official at CDC leading the coronavirus effort and we’re very grateful to him for his leadership uh and I’d like to as we move into the future want to make sure as you have had access we’re going to make sure that there are continued interactions and opportunities uh for you all to be continuing to engage with CDC as well as our career leaders here. Thank you very much bye-bye.",,
Food Safety and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Restaurants and retail food establishments are regulated at the state and local level. State, local, and tribal regulators use the Food Code published by the FDA to develop or update their own food safety rules. Again, there is no current evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 associated with food or food packaging.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or possibly eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. The coronavirus is mostly spread from one person to another through respiratory droplets. However, it’s always critical to follow the 4 key steps of food safety—clean, separate, cook, and chill—to prevent foodborne illness.

As an extra precaution to help avoid the transmission of COVID-19 through surface contact, we recommend frequent washing and sanitizing of all food contact surfaces and utensils. Food-service workers also must practice frequent hand washing and glove changes before and after preparing food. Include frequent cleaning and sanitizing of counters and condiment containers. Consumers should wash their hands after using serving utensils.

In communities with sustained transmission of COVID-19, state and local health authorities have implemented social-distancing measures which discourage or prohibit dining in congregate settings. We also recommend discontinuing self-service buffets and salad bars until these measures are lifted.

Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness. Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.",9/2/20 9:55,
COVID-19 Decontamination and Reuse of Filtering Facepiece Respirators,"When should limited reuse be implemented?

Limited FFR reuse is just one of several strategies available for addressing an N95 FFR crisis capacity situation when there is a known shortage of devices after conventional and contingency capacity strategies have been implemented. It should only be considered during a crisis capacity situation during a declared public health emergency. When an N95 FFR crisis situation no longer exists, limited FFR reuse should not be utilized.

Before deciding to implement FFR reuse, facilities should explore opportunities to switch to respirators that are designed to be decontaminated and reused (e.g., elastomeric respirators or powered air-purifying respirators) to reduce demand for FFRs and the need for crisis capacity strategies.

Limitations for Limited FFR reuse

Decrease in N95 FFR fit and filtration performance

NIOSH-certified N95 FFRs are designed to filter 95% of particles when appropriately fitted to the wearer’s face. This means that an N95 that is not properly fitted to the face will likely give the wearer less protection. N95 FFRs are designed to be single-use devices but may be used multiple times under crisis capacity strategies. N95 FFR performance will decrease as the number of hours and number of donnings and doffings increase.

The number of times that an FFR can be reused will likely be limited by its fit because the tethering straps can become weaker or stretched after each donning. Each time an N95 FFR is donned or doffed, the integrity of the straps may be impacted. Repeated donning and doffing will result in the straps no longer being able to generate enough force to create a tight seal with the face. The resulting poor seal will allow unfiltered air to enter the N95 FFR and into the wearer’s breathing zone.

CDC recommends limiting the number of donnings for an N95 FFR to no more than five per device. It may be possible to don some models of FFRs more than five times [2]. One study reported that fit performance decreased over multiple, consecutive donnings and fit varied among the different models of FFRs examined [3]. If manufacturer guidance on how many times a particular FFR can be donned is not available, the CDC recommends limiting the number of uses to no more than five per device based on published data on changes in FFR fit from a limited number of FFR models over multiple donnings.

A recent observational study conducted in a hospital emergency room during the COVID-19 pandemic found that extended use and reuse of N95 FFRs as measured by the total hours and shifts the mask was worn and the number of donnings and doffings was associated with an increase in the fit failure of the respirators. This study also showed that it may be possible to don some models of FFRs more than five times [2]. Fit performance during limited reuse should be monitored by the respiratory protection program manager or appropriate safety personnel. Information about how to assess N95 FFR fit during limited reuse can be found below. More information on limited FFR reuse can be found here.

When practicing limited reuse (a crisis capacity strategy), under what conditions should I discard my filtering facepiece respirator (FFR)?

Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are single-use, disposable respirators that are normally discarded after each use. However, due to limited supplies of N95 FFRs during the COVID-19 pandemic, reuse of FFRs may become necessary. OSHA has outlined temporary enforcement discretion to permit the reuse of FFRs under specific circumstances in its memorandum, Enforcement Guidance for Respiratory Protection and the N95 Shortage Due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemicexternal icon, issued on April 3, 2020. Employers should refer to this OSHA memorandum to identify the specific circumstances.

The number of times that an FFR can be reused is limited by:

Fit

Filtration performance

Contamination and soiling

Damage

FFRs visibly contaminated with blood, respiratory or nasal secretions, or other bodily fluids should be discarded and not reused. FFRs that are damaged (e.g., broken straps, broken nose piece), malformed, or are unable to pass a fit check should also be discarded and not reused.

Guidance on limiting the number of donnings to five can be found below.",2/11/20 0:00,
Agriculture Workers and Employers,"Control plan

Recommendations for worker infection prevention are based on an approach known as the hierarchy of controls. This approach groups actions by their likely effectiveness in reducing or removing hazards. In most cases, the preferred approach is to eliminate a hazard or hazardous processes (e.g. exclude sick workers and visitors), install feasible engineering controls, and implement appropriate protocols for cleaning, disinfection and sanitation to further reduce exposure or shield farmworkers. Until such controls are in place, or if they are not effective, other administrative control measures and personal protective equipment (PPE) will be needed.

Screening and monitoring workers

Consider screening farmworkers for COVID-19 signs and symptoms (e.g., temperature checks).[1] Uniform policies and procedures for screening workers should be developed in consultation with state and local health officials and occupational medicine professionals. Possible options to screen workers for COVID-19 symptoms could include:

Screening prior to entry into the work site, or if possible, before boarding shared transportation.

Asking workers in appropriate languages if they have had a fever (or feelings of feverishness), respiratory symptoms, or other symptoms in the past 24 hours.

Checking temperatures of workers at the start of each shift to identify anyone with a fever of 100.4℉ or greater (or reported feelings of feverishness).

Do not let employees enter the workplace if they have a fever of 100.4℉ or greater (or reported feeling of feverishness), or if screening results indicate that the worker is suspected of having COVID-19-like symptoms (see managing sick workers below).

Encouraging workers to report symptoms immediately, when onsite.

Encouraging workers who have symptoms to self-isolate and contact a healthcare provider, or when appropriate, providing them with access to direct medical care or telemedicine. Also: Coordinating any recommended diagnostic testing with the occupational medicine provider, or state and local public health officials. Providing them with information on when it is safe to return to work along with the operation’s return-to-work policies and procedures. Informing human resources, health unit (if in place), and supervisor (so worker can be moved off schedule during illness and a replacement can be assigned, if available).



Ensure that personnel performing screening activities, including temperature checks, are appropriately protected from exposure to potentially infectious workers entering the facility by:

Training temperature screeners to use temperature monitors according to manufacturer instructions.

Using temperature monitors that are accurate under conditions of use (such as extreme hot/cold weather temperatures).

Protecting the screener through the use of social distancing, barrier or partition controls, and personal protective equipment (PPE). However, reliance on PPE alone is a less effective control and is more difficult to implement, given PPE shortages and training requirements. See the “Should we be screening employees for COVID-19 symptoms?” section of General Business Frequently Asked Questions as a guide.

If temperature screeners need to be within 6 feet of workers, providing them with appropriate PPE: Such PPE should include gloves, a gown, a face shield, and, at a minimum, a facemask. See OSHA’s PPE standards at 29 CFR 1910 Subpart I external icon . Train employees on how to properly put on, take off, and dispose of all PPE. Filtering facepiece respirators, such as N95s, may be appropriate for workers performing screening duties. If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical evaluation, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134 external icon ). [2]



Managing sick workers

Workers who appear to have symptoms including a fever, cough, shortness of breath, or a two-or-more of the following symptoms including chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell, upon arrival at work, or who develop these symptoms during the day should immediately be separated from others at the workplace, sent to their permanent or temporary housing arrangements, or—when they can’t be isolated in their existing housing arrangement—placed in alternative housing arrangements under quarantine away from other workers. (Note: employers should consult DOLexternal icon and DHSexternal icon regulations and/or guidance for any additional requirements or obligations concerning temporary foreign workers under the H-2A program).

Since we don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, sick workers should stay away from animals, including livestock and pets, during their illness. Sick workers should be provided with informational resources to access medical attention should they need it. One such resource may be the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) websiteexternal icon which identifies HRSA-funded health centers. These health centers can assess whether a patient needs further evaluation, which may be done over the phone or using telehealth. Individuals may also receive primary health care services at their local health center at a reduced cost or free of charge depending on their economic status. Most people with COVID-19 will have mild illness and can recover at home.

Ensure that personnel managing sick employees are provided with appropriate PPE and training. For personnel who need to be within 6 feet of a sick colleague, follow the same PPE considerations listed for screeners above and consult OSHA’s PPE standards at 29 CFR 1910 Subpart Iexternal icon.

If a worker is confirmed to have COVID-19, owners/operators should consider ways to inform anyone at the work site, to the extent it is reasonably knowable, who has been in sustained, close contact (within 6 feet) with that worker of their possible exposure to COVID-19 based on the CDC Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure. However, the owners/operators should protect the infected worker’s confidentiality and not identify them, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).external icon

If a worker becomes or reports being sick, clean and disinfect the work area, equipment, common areas used (break areas, bathrooms, vehicles, etc.), and any tools handled by the symptomatic worker. If a worker is in employer-furnished housing, consider providing a dedicated space for the worker to recover away from others, and then clean and disinfect living quarters, cooking and eating areas, bathrooms, and laundry facilities. Do not allow other workers to use these areas until they have been cleaned and disinfected. A worker going to a home in the community can be provided with guidancepdf icon to mitigate risk of transmission in the home.

Owners/operators should work with state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) health officials to facilitate the identification of other exposed and potentially exposed individuals, such as coworkers. Facilities should work with STLT officials to consider the appropriate role for testing and workplace contact tracing (i.e., identifying person-to-person spread) after a worker tests positive for COVID-19.

On-site healthcare personnel, such as facility nurses or emergency medical technicians, should follow appropriate CDC and OSHA protective guidance for healthcare and emergency response personnel.

Addressing return to work after worker exposure to COVID-19

Employers should follow CDC’s Critical Infrastructure Guidance for workers who have had a COVID-19 exposure but remain free of symptoms.

Critical infrastructure employers have an obligation to manage the continuation of work in a way that best protects the health of their workers and the general public. Employers can use strategies from CDC’s COVID-19 Critical Infrastructure Sector Response Planning.

When workers return who have had COVID-19, including those workers who have tested positive for COVID-19 but remained free of symptoms, to onsite operations, employers should follow the CDC interim guidance for Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings. Consultation with an occupational health provider and state and local health officials will help owners/operators develop the most appropriate plan.

The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly changing, so employers of critical infrastructure workers will need to continue to reassess COVID-19 transmission levels in their area and follow recommendations from local, state, and federal officials. This guidance does not replace state and local directives for businesses.

Control plan—Engineering controls

Assess and identify opportunities to limit close contact with others (maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between people whenever possible) if feasible. This includes owners, operators, farmworkers, supervisors, crew leaders, delivery personnel, and anyone else entering the agricultural workplace. Engage farmworkers in this assessment process.

Adding touch-free methods (i.e., touch-free time clocks, automatic doors) or rearranging work tasks can help farmworkers stay at least 6 feet away from others. Possible options may include:

Adjusting workflow to allow for a 6-foot distance between farmworkers, if feasible.

Installing shields or barriers, such as plastic, between farmworkers, when a 6-foot distance between farmworkers is not possible.

Adding additional clock in/out stations (touch-free if available) or additional time for clocking in/out to reduce crowding, if feasible.

Removing or rearranging chairs and tables or adding visual cue marks in employee break areas to support social distancing between farmworkers.

Employers should also train workers to follow protective measures while on breaks.

Control plan—Cleaning, disinfection, and sanitation

Hand hygiene

Encourage farmworkers to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Farmworkers must have reasonable access to permanent and/or temporary hand washing facilities equipped with soap, potable water, and clean, single-use towels (29 CFR 1928.110 external icon ; 40 CFR 170.411 external icon , 170.509 external icon and 170.605(h)-(j) external icon ). Easy access is especially important in areas where multiple farmworkers are working; increase the number of hand washing stations to minimize the distance to a station and the likelihood of crowding at stations.

; 40 CFR 170.411 , 170.509 and 170.605(h)-(j) ). Easy access is especially important in areas where multiple farmworkers are working; increase the number of hand washing stations to minimize the distance to a station and the likelihood of crowding at stations. In addition, to increasing the frequency of hand washing, if hands aren’t visibly soiled or dirty, farmworkers can use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, rubbing hands until they are dry.

These sanitizing stations should be in multiple locations on the farm, if feasible, such as the point of entry or exit to a farm field, the location where farmworkers clock in/out, and, if possible, in individual containers made available to workers in field settings.

Disinfection and sanitation

Farm owners/operators should develop sanitation protocols for daily cleaning and sanitation of work sites, where it is feasible to disinfect the work site, as well as cleaning and disinfecting procedures for high-touch areas such as tools, equipment, and vehicles used by farmworkers, following CDC guidance on cleaning methods. In addition, they should:

Follow the manufacturer’s contact time recommendations to make sure solutions remain on surfaces for the recommended time.

Since children may be present on the farm, plan how to keep cleaning chemicals, including hand sanitizers out of reach of children.

Choose disinfectants or alternative cleaning methods (e.g., soap and water) for surfaces with which food comes into contact.

Also see additional information from EPA on cleaning and disinfecting workplacesexternal icon.

Conduct targeted and more frequent cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch areas of shared spaces (e.g., time clocks, bathroom fixtures, vending machines, railings, door handles). For example, possible options may include:

Clean and disinfect break areas between each group using the areas, as well as daily.

Clean and disinfect locker rooms at the end of each shift.

Provide disposable disinfectant wipes or other appropriate disinfectant supplies, and required PPE to use these safely, so that commonly touched surfaces can be wiped down, as needed.

Refer to the Transportation Section below for guidance on sanitizing farm vehicles and implements.

Sanitizing tools and equipment

Tools vary by agricultural production, but examples include handheld hoes, rakes, crates, milking equipment (including electronic components), gates, saddles, and animal harnesses.

Where possible, do not share tools.

If tools are used by multiple employees, they should be cleaned and disinfected between each employee use, if possible.

When cleaning and disinfecting after each use is not possible, daily targeted and more frequent cleaning of shared equipment and tools is needed. In such cases, workers may also need to use gloves when handling shared tools and equipment.

Dispose of all cleaning material and non-reusable PPE in compliance with OSHA standards external icon to prevent further spread of COVID-19.

Control plan—Administrative controls

Training

All communication and training for workers should be easy to understand and should be provided in languages appropriate to the preferred languages spoken or read by those receiving the training, be at the appropriate literacy level, and include accurate and timely information about:

Signs and symptoms of COVID-19, how it spreads, risks for workplace exposures, and how workers can protect themselves.

Proper handwashing practices and use of hand sanitizer stations.

Farm-specific social distancing practices (e.g., how to move through fields in a way that allows workers to stay at least 6 feet apart).

Cough and sneeze etiquette.

Other routine infection control precautions: Putting on and taking off masks and gloves. Social distancing measures.

Steps to take if they get sick.

Employer policies regarding COVID-19 (disinfection protocols, housing and worker isolation, sick leave policies) and how employees should alert their supervisors if they are experiencing signs or symptoms of COVID-19 or if they have had recent close contact with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.

Employers should consider placing simple posters at the entrance to the workplace and in break areas, employer furnished housing, and other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen. Posters should be in all of the languages that are common in the worker population. CDC has free, simple posters available to download and print, some of which are translated into different languages. OSHA provides additional informationexternal icon about training on its COVID-19 webpage.

Review leave and sick leave policies

Consider modifying policies to make sure that ill workers are not in the workplace and are not penalized for taking sick leave. Make sure that workers are aware of and understand these policies.

Analyze any incentive programs and consider modifying them, if warranted, so that workers are not penalized for taking sick leave if they have COVID-19.

Consider additional flexibilities that might include giving advances on future sick leave and allowing workers to donate sick leave to each other.

Promote social distancing",4/30/20 0:00,
Meat and Poultry Processing Workers and Employers,"Cloth face coverings in meat and poultry processing facilities CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings as a protective measure in addition to social distancing (i.e., staying at least 6 feet away from others). Cloth face coverings may be especially important when social distancing is not possible or feasible based on working conditions. A cloth face covering may reduce the amount of large respiratory droplets that a person spreads when talking, sneezing, or coughing. Cloth face coverings may prevent people who do not know they have the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading it to others. Cloth face coverings are intended to protect other people—not the wearer. Cloth face coverings are not PPE. They are not appropriate substitutes for PPE such as respirators (like N95 respirators) or medical facemasks (like surgical masks) in workplaces where respirators or facemasks are recommended or required to protect the wearer. While wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in communities, it may not be practical for workers to wear a single cloth face covering for the full duration of a work shift (e.g., eight or more hours) in a meat or poultry processing facility if they become wet, soiled, or otherwise visibly contaminated during the work shift. If cloth face coverings are worn in these facilities, employers should provide readily available clean cloth face coverings (or disposable facemask options) for workers to use when the coverings become wet, soiled, or otherwise visibly contaminated. Employers who determine that cloth face coverings should be worn in the workplace, including to comply with state or local requirements for their use, should ensure the cloth face coverings: fit over the nose and mouth and fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face;

are secured with ties or ear loops;

include multiple layers of fabric;

allow for breathing without restriction;

can be laundered using the warmest appropriate water setting and machine dried daily after the shift, without damage or change to shape (a clean cloth face covering should be used each day);

are not used if they become wet or contaminated;

are replaced with clean replacements, provided by employer, as needed;

are handled as little as possible to prevent transferring infectious materials to the cloth; and

are not worn with or instead of respiratory protection when respirators are needed.

Educate and train workers and supervisors about how they can reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Supplement workers’ normal and required job training (e.g., training required under OSHA standards) with additional training and information about COVID-19, recognizing signs and symptoms of infection, and ways to prevent exposure to the virus. Training should include information about how to implement the various infection prevention and control measures recommended here and included in any infection prevention and control or COVID-19 response plan that an employer develops. OSHA provides additional informationexternal icon about training on its COVID-19 webpage.

All communication and training should be easy to understand and should (1) be provided in languages appropriate to the preferred languages spoken or read by the workers, if possible; (2) be at the appropriate literacy level; and (3) include accurate and timely information about:

signs and symptoms of COVID-19, how it spreads, risks for workplace exposures, and how workers can protect themselves;

proper handwashing practices and use of hand sanitizer stations;

cough and sneeze etiquette; and

other routine infection control precautions (e.g., signs and symptoms of COVID-19, putting on or taking off masks or cloth face coverings and social distancing measures).

Employers should place simple posters in all of the languages that are common in the worker population that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, and proper hand hygiene practices. They should place these posters at the entrance to the workplace and in break areas, locker rooms, and other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.

Employers should post signs that you can read from a far distance (or use portable, electronic reader boards) that inform visitors and workers of social distancing practices.

OSHA understands that some employers may face difficulties complying with certain OSHA standards due to the ongoing health emergency, including those standards that require certain types of worker training. OSHA is providing enforcement discretionexternal icon around completion of training and other provisions in its various standards. OSHA has instructed its Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs) to evaluate whether an employer has made a good faith effort to comply with applicable OSHA standards and, in situations where compliance was not possible given the ongoing pandemic, to ensure that employees were not exposed to hazards from tasks, processes, or equipment for which they were not prepared or trained.

Cleaning and disinfection in meat and poultry processing

For tool-intensive operations, employers should ensure tools are regularly cleaned and disinfected, including at least as often as workers change workstations or move to a new set of tools. Refer to List Nexternal icon on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2.

Establish protocols and provide supplies to increase the frequency of sanitization in work and common spaces. Disinfect frequently touched surfaces in workspaces and break rooms (e.g., microwave or refrigerator handles or vending machine touchpads) at least once per shift, if possible. For example, wipe down tools or other equipment at least as often as workers change workstations. Frequently clean push bars and handles on any doors that do not open automatically and handrails on stairs or along walkways. If physical barriers are being used, then these should be cleaned frequently.

Workers who perform cleaning and disinfection tasks may require additional PPE and other controls to protect them from chemical hazards posed by disinfectants. Note: Employers mustexternal icon ensure their written hazard communication program is up to date and training is up to date for all employees. (Also see OSHA’s enforcement discretion memorandumexternal icon on this topic.) Employers may need to adapt guidance from this section, the Environmental Services Workers and Employersexternal icon section, and the Interim Guidance for Workers and Employers of Workers at Increased Risk of Occupational Exposureexternal icon, to fully protect workers performing cleaning and disinfection activities in manufacturing workplaces.

Screening1 and monitoring workers

Workplaces, particularly in areas where community transmission of COVID-19 is occurring, should consider developing and implementing a comprehensive screening and monitoring strategy aimed at preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into the worksite. Consider a program of screening workers before entry into the workplace, criteria for return to work of exposed and recovered (those who have had signs or symptoms of COVID-19 but have gotten better), and criteria for exclusion of sick workers. This type of program should be coordinated to the extent possible with local public health authorities and could consist of the following activities:

Screening of workers for COVID-19

Screening meat and poultry processing workers for COVID-19 symptoms (such as temperature checks) is an optional strategy that employers may use. If implemented for all workers, policies and procedures for screening workers should be developed in consultation with state and local health officials and occupational medicine professionals. Options to screen workers for COVID-19 symptoms include:

Screen prior to entry into the facility.

Provide verbal screening in appropriate language(s) to determine whether workers have had a fever, felt feverish, or had chills, coughing, or difficulty breathing in the past 24 hours.

Check temperatures of workers at the start of each shift to identify anyone with a fever of 100.4℉ or greater (or reported feelings of feverishness). Ensure that screeners: are trained to use temperature monitors and monitors are accurate under conditions of use (such as cold temperatures); and wear appropriate PPE.

Do not let employees enter the workplace if they have a fever of 100.4℉ or greater (or reported feelings of feverishness), or if screening results indicate that the worker is suspected of having COVID-19. Encourage workers to self-isolate and contact a healthcare provider; Provide information on the facility’s return-to-work policies and procedures; and Inform human resources, employer health unit (if in place), and supervisor (so worker can be moved off schedule during illness and a replacement can be assigned, if needed).



Ensure that personnel performing screening activities, including temperature checks, are appropriately protected from exposure to potentially infectious workers entering the facility:

Implement engineering controls, such as physical barriers or dividers or rope and stanchion systems, to maintain at least six feet of distance between screeners and workers being screened.

If screeners need to be within six feet of workers, provide them with appropriate PPE based on the repeated close contact the screeners have with other workers. Such PPE may include gloves, a gown, a face shield, and, at a minimum, a face mask. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (or more protective) may be appropriate for workers performing screening duties and necessary for workers managing a sick employee in the work environment (see below) if that employee has signs or symptoms of COVID-19. If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134 external icon ).



Managing sick workers

Workers who appear to have symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) upon arrival at work or who become sick during the day should immediately be separated from others at the workplace and sent home.

Ensure that personnel managing sick employees are appropriately protected from exposure. When personnel need to be within six feet of a sick colleague, appropriate PPE may include gloves, a gown, a face shield and, at a minimum, a face mask. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (or more protective) may be appropriate for workers managing a sick employee if that employee has signs or symptoms of COVID-19. If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134external icon).

If a worker is confirmed to have COVID-19, employers should inform anyone they have come into contact with (including fellow workers, inspectors, graders, etc.) of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but should maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The employer should instruct fellow workers about how to proceed based on the CDC Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure.

If a worker becomes or reports being sick, disinfect the workstation used and any tools handled by the symptomatic worker.

Employers should work with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health officials to facilitate the identification of other exposed and potentially exposed individuals, such as coworkers in a plant.

On-site healthcare personnel, such as facility nurses or emergency medical technicians, should follow appropriate CDC and OSHA guidance for healthcare and emergency response personnel.

Addressing return to work

Critical infrastructure employers have an obligation to manage the continuation of work and return to work of their workers in ways that best protect the health of workers, their coworkers, and the general public. Employers should consider providing screening and ongoing medical monitoring of these workers, ensuring they wear an appropriate source control device in accordance with CDC and OSHA guidance, and implementing social distancing to minimize the chances of workers exposing one another.

Critical infrastructure employers should continue to minimize the number of workers present at worksites, balancing the need to protect workers with support for continuing critical operations.

Reintegration (bringing back) of exposed, asymptomatic workers to onsite operations should follow the CDC Critical Infrastructure Guidance. The guidance advises that employers may permit workers who have been exposed to COVID-19, but remain without symptoms, to continue to work, provided they adhere to additional safety precautions. Consultation with an occupational health provider and state and local health officials will help employers develop the most appropriate plan consistent with CDC guidance.

Reintegration of workers with COVID-19 (COVID-19 positive), including those workers who have remained asymptomatic, to onsite operations should follow the CDC interim guidance, “Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings.”

As employers move forward with continuing essential work, they should implement strategies to prioritize positions without which critical work would stop. This prioritization should include an analysis of work tasks, workforce availability at specific worksites, and assessment of hazards associated with the tasks and worksite. Employers may be able to cross-train workers to perform critical duties at a worksite to minimize the total number of workers needed to continue operations.

For workers who have had signs/symptoms of COVID-19

Workers with COVID-19 who have symptoms and have stayed home (home isolated) should not return to work until they have met the criteria to discontinue home isolation, and have consulted with their healthcare providers and state and local health departments.

The situation is constantly changing, so employers of critical infrastructure workers will need to continue to reassess the virus’s transmission levels in their area.

Personal protective equipment

Employers must conduct a hazard assessment to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, for which workers need PPE. OSHA’s PPE standards (29 CFR 1910 Subpart Iexternal icon) require employers to select and provide appropriate PPE to protect workers from hazards identified in the hazard assessment. The results of that assessment will be the basis of workplace controls (including PPE) needed to protect workers.

Employers should:

Use videos or in-person visual demonstrations of proper PPE donning and doffing procedures. (Maintain social distancing during these demonstrations.)

Emphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off PPE to ensure that the worker or the item does not become contaminated.

Provide PPE that is either disposable (preferred) or, if reusable, ensure it is properly disinfected and stored in a clean location when not in use.

PPE worn at the facility should not be taken home or shared.

Face shields may serve as both PPE and source control:

If helmets are being used, use face shields designed to attach to helmets.

Face shields can provide additional protection from both potential process-related splashes and potential person-to-person droplet spread. Safety glasses may fog up when used in combination with masks or cloth face coverings. Only some face shields are acceptable substitutions for eye protection (such as safety glasses) that are used for impact protection; facilities should consult with an occupational safety and health professional concerning the use of face shields.

Face shields can help minimize contamination of masks and cloth face coverings.

If used, face shields should be cleaned and decontaminated after each shift, and when not in use they should be kept in a clean location at the work facility.

If used, face shields should also wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin.

Employers should stress hand hygiene before and after handling all PPE. Employers in meat and poultry processing industries should continue to stay up to date on the most current guidance concerning PPE.

As part of their hazard assessments, employers must always consider whether PPE is necessary to protect workers. Specifically, when engineering and administrative controls are difficult to maintain and there may be exposure to other workplace hazards, such as splashes or sprays of liquids on processing lines or disinfectants used for facility cleaning, PPE should be considered.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, meat and poultry processing employers should consider allowing voluntary use of filtering facepiece respirators (such as an N95, if available) for their workers, even if respirators are not normally required.

In addition to face shields as noted above, workers in meat and poultry processing facilities may need PPE such as gloves, face and eye protection, and other types of PPE when cleaning and disinfecting meat and poultry processing plants (including frequently touched surfaces), tools, and equipment.

When PPE is needed, employers should consider additional hazards created by poorly fitting PPE (e.g., mask ties that dangle or catch, PPE that is loose and requires frequent adjustment or tends to fall off) with respect to the work environment (e.g., machinery in which PPE could get caught).

Workers’ rights

Section 11(c)external icon of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970external icon, 29 USC 660(c), prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for raising concerns about safety and health conditions. Additionally, OSHA’s Whistleblower Protection Programexternal icon enforces the provisions of more than 20 industry-specific federal laws protecting employees from retaliation for raising or reporting concerns about hazards or violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health insurance reform, motor vehicle safety, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime, securities, and tax laws. OSHA encourages workers who suffer such retaliation to submit a complaint to OSHAexternal icon as soon as possible in order to file their complaint within the legal time limits, some of which may be as short as 30 days from the date they learned of or experienced retaliation. An employee can file a complaint with OSHA by visiting or calling his or her local OSHA office; sending a written complaint via fax, mail, or email to the closest OSHA office; or filing a complaint online. No particular form is required, and complaints may be submitted in any language.

OSHA provides recommendations intended to assist employers in creating workplaces that are free of retaliation and guidance to employers on how to properly respond to workers who may complain about workplace hazards or potential violations of federal laws. OSHA urges employers to review its publication Recommended Practices for Anti-Retaliation Programspdf iconexternal icon.

1 Employers should evaluate the burdens and benefits of recording workers’ temperatures or asking them to complete written questionnaires. These types of written products become records that must be retained for the duration of the workers’ employment plus 30 years.

Symptoms of Coronavirus,"What is the difference between Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19?

Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.

There are some key differences between flu and COVID-19. COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. Another important difference is there is a vaccine to protect against flu. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.

Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two.

Frequently Asked Questions about Coronavirus (COVID-19) for Laboratories,"FDA has authorized EUAs for both viral and antibody tests for COVID-19. Viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In contrast, antibody tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out COVID-19.

Most of the PCR-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). However, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. For this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient.

Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infections or to inform infection status. Negative results from antibody testing do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period. Until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2.

If a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed. Read more:",2/11/20 0:00,

The push for a COVID-19 vaccine,"The world is in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic. As WHO and partners work together on the response -- tracking the pandemic, advising on critical interventions, distributing vital medical supplies to those in need--- they are racing to find a vaccine.

Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the body’s natural defences --- the immune system--- to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. If the body is exposed to those disease-causing germs later, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing illness.

Immunization currently prevents 2-3 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles. There are now vaccines to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, and work is ongoing at unprecedented speed to also make COVID-19 a vaccine-preventable disease.



There are currently more than 100 COVID-19 vaccine candidates under development, with a number of these in the human trial phase. WHO is working in collaboration with scientists, business, and global health organizations through the ACT Accelerator to speed up the pandemic response. When a safe and effective vaccine is found, COVAX (led by WHO, GAVI and CEPI) will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of these vaccines to protect people in all countries. People most at risk will be prioritized.",,
The World Health Organization and Wikimedia Foundation expand access to trusted information about COVID-19 on Wikipedia,"The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that administers Wikipedia, announced today a collaboration to expand the public’s access to the latest and most reliable information about COVID-19.



The collaboration will make trusted, public health information available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license at a time when countries face continuing resurgences of COVID-19 and social stability increasingly depends on the public’s shared understanding of the facts.

Through the collaboration, people everywhere will be able to access and share WHO infographics, videos, and other public health assets on Wikimedia Commons, a digital library of free images and other multimedia.

With these new freely-licensed resources, Wikipedia’s more than 250,000 volunteer editors can also build on and expand the site’s COVID-19 coverage, which currently offers more than 5,200 coronavirus-related articles in 175 languages. This WHO content will also be translated across national and regional languages through Wikipedia’s vast network of global volunteers.

“Equitable access to trusted health information is critical to keeping people safe and informed during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. ""Our new collaboration with the Wikimedia Foundation will increase access to reliable health information from WHO across multiple countries, languages, and devices.""

Since the beginning of the pandemic, WHO has taken steps to prevent an “infodemic”— defined by the organization as “an overabundance of information and the rapid spread of misleading or fabricated news, images, and videos.”

Wikipedia editors have similarly been on the frontlines of preventing the spread of misinformation surrounding the coronavirus, ensuring information about the pandemic is based on reliable sources and updated regularly on Wikipedia.

By making verified information about the pandemic available to more people on one of the world’s most-visited knowledge resources, the organizations aim to help curb this infodemic and ensure everyone can access critical public health information.

“Access to information is essential to healthy communities and should be treated as such,” said Katherine Maher, CEO at the Wikimedia Foundation. “This becomes even more clear in times of global health crises when information can have life-changing consequences. All institutions, from governments to international health agencies, scientific bodies to Wikipedia, must do our part to ensure everyone has equitable and trusted access to knowledge about public health, regardless of where you live or the language you speak.”

WHO has served as the leading international health agency spearheading the global response to the coronavirus outbreak. Since the beginning, WHO has worked to rapidly establish international coordination, scale up country readiness and response, and accelerate research and innovation. Today, as information on the transmission and epidemiology of the virus evolves, WHO continues to provide essential guidance and public health recommendations to governments, communities and individuals everywhere.

At the same time, Wikipedia volunteer editors, many of whom are from the medical community, have been creating, updating, and translating Wikipedia articles with information from reliable sources about the pandemic. As one of the top ten sites in the world, studies have shown that Wikipedia is one of the most frequently viewed sources for health information.

At the moment, readers can access WHO’s mythbusting series of infographics on Wikimedia Commons. The infographics, which focus on addressing common misconceptions about COVID-19, are also available for Wikipedia editors to incorporate into Wikipedia articles.

In the coming months, the Wikimedia Foundation and WHO will continue uploading resources to Wikimedia Commons and collaborating with Wikipedia volunteer editors to better understand gaps in information needs on Wikipedia articles related to COVID-19 and how WHO resources can help fill these gaps.

Additionally, under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, other organizations, individuals, and websites can more easily share these materials on their own platforms without having to address stricter copyright restrictions.

Statement of the Twenty-Sixth Polio IHR Emergency Committee,"The twenty-sixth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened and opened by the WHO Deputy Director-General on 14 October 2020 with committee members attending via video conference, supported by the WHO Secretariat. Dr Zsuzsana Jakab in opening remarks on behalf of Dr Tedros congratulated all those involved in eliminating wild polioviruses from the WHO African Region despite some very challenging obstacles. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing spread of cVDPV2 were both growing major challenges, which would require strenuous efforts to overcome in order to restart progress toward global polio eradication.

The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV). The following IHR States Parties provided an update at the video conference or in writing on the current situation in their respective countries: Afghanistan, Chad, Egypt, Guinea, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen.

Wild poliovirus

The higher incidence of global WPV1 cases seen during 2020 continues, with 121 cases reported between 1 January – 5 October 2020 compared to 85 for the same period in 2019, a 42% increase. Last year there were 176 WPV1 cases, the highest number reported since the PHEIC was declared in 2014, when there were 359 cases in nine countries. The lowest number of WPV1 cases was reported in 2017, when only 22 cases were found. No wild polio cases have been detected outside of Pakistan and Afghanistan since the last cases in Nigeria in 2016 four years ago. The number of positive environmental samples has increased 70% to 375 compared to 221 for the same time last year. Since the last meeting, exportation of WPV1 from Pakistan to Afghanistan has been documented.

The Committee noted that based on results from sequencing of WPV1 since the last committee meeting in June, there were further instances of international spread of viruses from Pakistan to Afghanistan. The ongoing frequency of WPV1 international spread between the two countries and the increased vulnerability in other countries where routine immunization and polio prevention activities have both been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are two major factors that suggest the risk of international spread may be at the highest level since 2014. While border closures and lockdowns may mitigate the risk in the short term while in force, this would be outweighed in the longer term by falling population immunity through disruption of vaccination and the resumption of normal population movements.

On the other hand the certification of the WHO African Region as wild polio free in August 2020 indicated a lessening of the global risk from this previous source.

Vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV)

The committee was very concerned that the international spread of cVDPV2 continues, causing new outbreaks in Guinea, South Sudan and Sudan, the latter two due to importation of a cVDPV2 lineage that emerged in Chad in 2019. The same virus has also been detected in sewage in Cairo, Egypt but with no evidence of local circulation. The number of cases in 2020 is 409 as at 5 October 2020, already exceeding the 378 cases reported for the whole of 2019. As in all other years after 2016 when OPV2 was withdrawn, the number of cVDPV2 cases has been greater than the number of WPV1 cases in 2020. However, the number of sub-types / lineages detected so far in 2020 is 27, compared to 42 for the whole of 2019, and the number of newly emerged viruses is only seven so far this year, compared to 38 during 2019.

Cross border spread of cVDPV2 is now occurring regularly. Based on analysis by the US CDC of isolates, in the three months from April to June 2020, there has been evidence of exportation of cVDPV2 from:

· Pakistan to Afghanistan

· Côte d’Ivoire to Mali

· Guinea to Mali

· Côte d’Ivoire to Ghana, and Ghana to Côte d’Ivoire

· CAR to Cameroon

· Chad to Sudan and South Sudan

· Ghana to Burkina Faso

COVID-19

The committee heard that nearly all countries (90%) have experienced disruption to health services especially in low and middle income countries, according to a survey of 105 countries conducted March – June 2020. Routine immunization particularly outreach services was the area most frequently reported as disrupted.

The committee was very concerned that most of the current outbreak countries have had to delay immunization responses in recent months, meaning that transmission is likely continuing unchecked. Furthermore, there appear to be significant falls in surveillance indicators in many of the outbreak countries, such as drops in AFP reporting rates, and lesser drops in environmental sampling. Vaccine management and supply has been significantly impacted. More than 60 campaigns in 28 countries have been postponed since late February and early March. Vaccine supplies have been disrupted in many ways, with some quantities already in-country at risk of exceeding their expiry data and therefore unusable. Some suppliers are reaching storage capacity and may well be forced to stop production.

Although the resumption of Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) is now occurring, the waves of the pandemic are expected to fluctuate considerably from country to country and across the WHO Regions, so the program will need to adjust according to the COVID-19 situation for the foreseeable future.

Although in general surveillance processes are continuing, there are clear signs of a significant drop in AFP case reporting, including in endemic countries, some outbreak countries and some other non-infected high risk countries.

The committee noted that GPEI modeling indicated there is a risk of an exponential rise in the number of cVDPV2 infected districts in the African Region, leading to a 200% increase if response SIAs had not resumed. In addition to the risk of WPV1 geographical spread and intensification, cVDPV2 cases could rise exponentially in Pakistan and Afghanistan potentially reaching more the 3,500 cases without a resumption of immunization response. Consequently, both Pakistan and Afghanistan are now implementing large scale mOPV2 campaigns and will continue with tOPV/mOPV2 until controlled. While there has been rapid spread, particularly in Afghanistan, expected exponential rise has been curtailed by the resumption of campaigns in July.

Conclusion

The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio PHEIC, but concludes that the current situation is extraordinary, with clear ongoing and increasing risk of international spread and ongoing need for coordinated international response. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:

Rising risk of WPV1 international spread:

Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of WPV1 appears to be currently very high:

· increasing transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan as evidenced by higher case numbers and positive environmental samples;

· greater geographical spread within the endemic countries, particularly Afghanistan;

· the ongoing inaccessibility in many provinces of Afghanistan, leading increasingly to highly susceptible populations which are and will continue to drive higher transmission;

· the drop in population immunity consequent on the pause in polio vaccination necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to greater susceptibility to poliovirus importation and outbreaks in high risk countries;

· the complicated context of WPV eradication activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan created by the need to simultaneously respond to cVDPV2 and COVID-19;

· the difficulties in supplying vaccines due to the pandemic (as is being seen in Yemen, for example);

· the possible expiring of vaccines in country and stockpiles caused by delays in polio vaccination activities;

· the results of modelling done by GPEI on the potential consequences for WPV1 of the pause on eradication activities.

Rising risk of cVDPV international spread:

The international spread of cVDPV2 is now established, with three newly infected countries being reported since June 2020. While experience demonstrates the effectiveness of Sabin OPV2 in controlling outbreaks, and changes in the strategy and standard operating procedures for responding to cVDPV2 appear to be succeeding in reducing the risk of new emergences in outbreak zones and neighbouring areas, overall the problem continues to grow, affecting more countries and paralyzing more children.

● COVID-19: This unprecedented pandemic is likely to continue to substantially negatively impact the polio eradication program and outbreak control efforts. The need to take extra precautions to prevent COVID-19 transmission will probably have an impact on vaccination coverage, and also hamper polio surveillance activities leading to increased risk of missed transmission.

● Falling PV2 immunity: Global population mucosal immunity to type 2 polioviruses (PV2) continues to fall, as the cohort of children born after OPV2 withdrawal grows, exacerbated by poor coverage with IPV particularly in some of the cVDPV infected countries.

● Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies including COVID19, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.

● Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Myanmar, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.

● Population movement: While border closures may have mitigated the short term risk, conversely the risk once borders begin to be re-opened is likely to be higher.

● The results of cVDPV2 modelling, done by GPEI in June 2020 which had indicated that there was a risk of an exponential rise in the number of cVDPV2 infected districts in the African Region and in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

● New cVDPV1 outbreak: The new outbreak of cVDPV1 in Yemen in an area of conflict is a further example of the risks anywhere that conflict can contribute to lower immunization rates and therefore new emergences of other cVDPV.

Risk categories

The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:

● States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.

● States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.

● States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.

Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:

● Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.

● Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period

● These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps.

Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months. After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.

TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS

States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread

WPV1

Afghanistan (most recent detection 7 Sep 2020)

Pakistan (most recent detection 16 Sep 2020)

cVDPV1

Malaysia (most recent detection 13 March 2020)

Philippines (most recent detection 28 November 2019)

Yemen (most recent detection 5 June 2020)

These countries should:

● Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.

● Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.

● Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.

● Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.

● Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).

● Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.

● Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.

● Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.

● Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel.

Let’s flatten the infodemic curve,"We are all being exposed to a huge amount of COVID-19 information on a daily basis, and not all of it is reliable. Here are some tips for telling the difference and stopping the spread of misinformation.

Due to COVID-19, most of us have a new word in our vocabulary: epidemiology. It is the branch of medical science that deals with the ways diseases are transmitted and can be controlled in a population. Now it is time to learn another new word: infodemiology.

As humans, we are a curious and innovative species. We want to understand the world around us and stay up to date on the challenges we face and how to overcome them. One of the ways we do this is by seeking out and sharing information – lots of it. Even scientists around the world are working hard to keep up with the thousands of studies that have come out since COVID-19 appeared.

But it is not only scientific studies. There are also official communications from governments and health agencies around the world. Then there are news articles and opinion pieces, and messages from vloggers, bloggers, podcasters and social media influencers. You may also see information shared by friends and family on social media or messaging apps.

All of this is called the infodemic: a flood of information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Infodemiology is the study of that information and how to manage it.",,
How polio personnel are pivoting against COVID-19,"World Polio Day, on 24 October, is when the world comes together to celebrate the determination that has brought us 99% of the way to ending polio, and reflect on the heights we must scale to defeat the disease completely.

This year, Africa was declared free of wild poliovirus, a testimony to the outstanding work of thousands of health workers and their supporters over many decades.

Despite this, 2020 may be the toughest year polio eradicators have ever faced. In the last eight months, immunization services have taken a devastating hit. An estimated 80 million children under one may have missed critical vaccines. Vaccine-preventable diseases – including polio – have spread in the most vulnerable contexts. This year, new outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio have been detected in the Eastern Mediterranean and African regions, including in Yemen, Sudan and South Sudan.

WHO is working closely with national Governments to urgently respond to outbreaks and repair immunization systems affected in the early months of the pandemic. In the context of a significant budget shortfall and increased costs of delivering health interventions due to the pandemic, outbreak response for both polio and measles will require additional funding and urgent action.

Below, learn about the work of polio personnel around the world to deliver polio vaccines and close immunity gaps, whilst continuing to fight COVID-19.

“I chose to continue to do public health awareness during the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to help save people’s lives and continue to serve my people,” says Nasrin Ahmadi, a polio worker and volunteer for the COVID-19 response in Balkh province in Afghanistan.

Eight months since the first COVID-19 case was reported in Afghanistan, polio programme frontline workers continue to support outbreak response. During the pandemic, Nasrin has taken on extra duties to identify suspected COVID-19 cases, share accurate information with communities, and trace individuals returning from abroad to encourage them to isolate. Throughout, she has continued to educate families on the importance of polio vaccination.

In addition to his polio duties, Mohamed provides COVID-19 support to 17 districts in Banadir, Somalia through coordinating and training COVID-19 teams, carrying out active surveillance visits to health facilities and reviewing reports submitted by district polio officers on the pandemic response.

In September, he took part in the first immunization campaign to resume in Somalia since COVID-19 arrived in the country. All children who took part in the campaign were offered deworming tablets and vitamin A in addition to measles and polio vaccines. Delivering multiple services is crucial in the context of ongoing polio and measles outbreaks in Somalia, and low overall population immunity.

Polio teams in Pakistan have been working to support the COVID-19 response since the beginning of the pandemic, as well as continuing with their work to eradicate polio.

In Peshawar, the team has adapted existing acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance networks embedded in hospitals and health facilities to detect COVID-19 as well as polio. Polio staff like Dr Samreen Khalil have been helping with testing and have trained health workers on infection prevention and control. Polio data management systems across the country and a call centre in the capital, Islamabad, assist in addressing misinformation and helping to detect suspected COVID-19 cases.

In the African region, the polio eradication programme has a long history of responding to other disease outbreaks and health emergencies. With its unmatched technical expertise, disease surveillance and logistics capacities as well as wide community networks, the polio team was perfectly placed to mobilise a large-scale emergency response to COVID-19, while maintaining polio eradication efforts.

Dr Sylvester Maleghemi, WHO Polio Team Lead in South Sudan, explains, “Across Africa, polio infrastructure and staff are found at district, province, all the way to the national level, so whenever there’s an outbreak, polio teams are always the first to respond.”

As the pandemic progresses, polio staff and resources across the globe continue to tackle COVID-19, while pushing to rid the world of all forms of polio, close the immunity gap, and contribute towards universal health coverage.

United Nations at 75: bringing humanity together for a better tomorrow,"Seventy-five years ago, countries came together and formed the United Nations, in the hope of saving future generations from the scourge of war.

Today, the United Nations is the only forum in the world where 193 countries can discuss issues affecting us all, find areas of agreement and solve problems together.

Through the United Nations and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world can promote peace, health, prosperity, gender equity and human rights, and ensure a more sustainable tomorrow. Within the United Nations, WHO works to secure the health of all people, everywhere.

Building health across generations

In the past 75 years, the United Nations has made a real difference to the lives of billions of people across continents and across generations.

For example, when WHO announced the eradication of smallpox in 1980, a disease that had plagued humanity for over 3000 years, it also marked a victory for global cooperation. No country could have done it alone.

When WHO and its partners spearheaded efforts to tackle the HIV epidemic, the world witnessed a monumental shift in the way the disease was progressing. Global coordination means that today more and more people can manage the disease. And prevention efforts are returning promising results. No country could achieve this alone.

In 2020, the African continent was declared free of wild poliovirus, a historic milestone for all of humanity. This means that 5 of the 6 WHO regions are now wild polio free, representing 90% of the world’s population. This was achieved because, with WHO’s support, countries came together and coordinated immunization and public health efforts. No country could have realized this alone.

Solidarity and multilateralism to move beyond the COVID-19 pandemic

Today, an unprecedented pandemic has plunged the world into a global health emergency, impacting our economies, our livelihoods and our health. Health is a human right, and when that human right is threatened, everything else is at risk.

The pandemic has highlighted now more than ever the need for the world to come together in unity and in solidarity. No country can beat these challenges alone.

“COVID-19 offers us an opportunity to build back a better society for the future. To achieve this, we already have necessity and innovation. Now we need courage and collaboration. I count on you, and you can count on the World Health Organization,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.

UN75: The future we want, the United Nations we need

In January 2020, the United Nations launched a global consultation to mark its 75th anniversary. Through surveys and dialogues, it asked people about their hopes and fears for the future, and by 21 September this year, over 1 million people had taken part.

The top 3 findings are:

Amidst the current crisis, the immediate priority of most respondents everywhere is improved access to basic services: health care, safe water and sanitation, and education. The next main priority is greater international solidarity and increased support to the places hardest hit by the pandemic. This includes tackling poverty and inequalities, and boosting employment. While health is the most pressing issue now, respondents were hopeful about this area improving. They also believe access to education and women’s rights will improve.

“Across this anniversary year, we have engaged in a global conversation. And the results are striking. People are thinking big – they are also expressing an intense yearning for international cooperation and global solidarity. Now is the time to respond to these aspirations and realize these aims. In this 75th anniversary year, we face our own 1945 moment. We must meet that moment. We must show unity like never before to overcome today’s emergency, get the world moving and working and prospering again, and uphold the vision of the Charter,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres.

Note: On 30 October 2020, the sentence ""Now, over 90% of the world’s population is polio-free"" was changed to ""This means that 5 of the 6 WHO regions are now wild polio free, representing 90% of the world’s population.""",,
Epidemiologist Sergiu Sîngeorzan: “COVID-19 has taught people to wash their hands”,"“Since I started as an epidemiologist, I’ve been preaching hand hygiene as one of the most effective ways to fight infection. Now I don’t have to say it twice,” muses Dr Sergiu Sîngeorzan, senior epidemiologist at Miercurea Ciuc hospital, Romania.

Dr Sîngeorzan points out that COVID-19 has taught people to wash their hands. If the message sticks, it would go a long way towards improving the safety of health-care workers and patients, he says, adding that “now, everybody washes their hands, not only in hospitals, but also in the community”.

Risk of burnout

Hand hygiene is one of the physical measures that health-care workers can take to protect themselves from the virus, but they must also take recovery breaks, resting hours, and planned holidays where no one from work disturbs them.

Dr Andreea Moldovan, senior physician on infectious diseases and epidemiology specialist at Brașov hospital in Romania says the wear and tear of day-to-day duties is mental rather than physical. Burnout is a risk for patient safety, and health-care workers do everything they can to avoid it and to stop themselves getting “campaign fatigue”.

Staff, supplies and facilities – all essential elements for a successful response

“I had a formative experience at the very beginning,” recalls Dr Sîngeorzan on being deployed from Miercurea Ciuc hospital to Suceava, where there were hundreds of cases. “I learned that the human factor is what makes or breaks a hospital. Suceava hospital had everything to mount a great response in terms of hospital infrastructure, supplies and facilities. Once it was properly staffed and the staff were looked after, the COVID-19 response improved, and the outbreak was controlled.”

Human resources are key to a successful response. Brașov Infectious Diseases Hospital was designated as a COVID-19 hospital from the outset of the pandemic. As patients began to be transferred, staff took precautions to protect themselves from the virus. Dr Moldovan says she felt completely safe in the hospital, where there was sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE), effective disinfectant, proper ventilation and a willingness to adhere closely to infection prevention and control rules.

“At all times, health-care workers are aware that following rules and properly using PPE is critical,” she observes. “Our health, and the health of patients, depends on these simple but lifesaving gestures.”

Even when there were disinfectant shortages, settings like Miercurea Ciuc hospital made their own alcohol-based solutions in their laboratories, using the WHO production guide. The hospital also implemented a WHO COVID-19 risk assessment survey for health-care workers, which allowed them to adapt their response to the virus based on accurate, reliable and real-time hospital data.

Gratitude, concern and satisfaction

In Brașov, most COVID-19 cases were found to have originated in the community. “As doctors and nurses, we often felt small and helpless in the face of this virus, but we received generous support and donations from the community in Brașov and nationwide,” explains Dr Moldovan, who describes a mass movement in support of medical staff across the country.

Although COVID-19 wrought a radical change in people’s professional and personal lives, health-care workers still felt great satisfaction as COVID-19 patients began to return home. Precautions to protect both their physical and mental health paid off. However, staff in those hospitals also worry for non-COVID-19 patients who had to be transferred to other health facilities. “It is important not to abandon the other patients as we focus on this virus,” warns Dr Moldovan.",,
Obesity significantly increases chances of severe outcomes for COVID-19 patients,"Obesity can significantly increase the chances of severe outcomes for patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To raise awareness of this linkage and to discuss the latest academic research of the topic, WHO/Europe has organized a virtual expert meeting on 22 October 2020. It brings together representatives of several Member States of the WHO European Region with experts to share resources on data collection, epidemiology and the best policy approaches to address obesity in the context of COVID-19.

Noncommunicable diseases and COVID-19: a bad combination

COVID-19 has been detected in over 185 countries globally, with more than 40 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million deaths. The latest data shows that obesity, one of the main risk factors for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), has a clear connection with these statistics.

The latest scientific evidence, based on multiple studies, shows that patients with obesity (including young adults) hospitalized with COVID-19 experienced substantially higher rates of severe outcomes, such as requiring intensive care treatment, mechanical ventilation and death.

Research on the linkage between obesity, NCDs and COVID-19 is very important for the European Region as it is the region most affected by NCD-related morbidity and mortality. An increasing proportion of children and adults in the Region are living with overweight or obesity. In addition to causing psychological problems, excess weight drastically increases a person’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes.

“WHO wants to provide a platform where Member States can easily share their experience and data relating to obesity, NCDs and COVID-19 related outcomes. This expert meeting provides an opportunity for policy-makers, experts and health professionals of the Region to do this,” said Dr João Breda, Head of the WHO European Office for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases, one of the event’s organizers. “The knowledge and insights gained during this meeting will contribute to WHO’s reports and recommendations”.

Pandemic of unhealthy foods

Continued NCD management and awareness of its importance is critical during the COVID-19 outbreak. The movement restrictions employed by countries during the pandemic have increased the risk of obesity and impeded its management by limiting people’s ability to obtain healthy food, get sufficient exercise or access health-care services.

Recent research highlights other worrying trends, such as rising sales of unhealthy snacks and digital marketing of unhealthy foods to children. In some countries of the European Region, producers of unhealthy foods have started a discussion on introducing weaker marketing restrictions and reformulations of processed foods under the pretext of COVID-19 and its impact on the Region’s economies.

“In the UK, we have observed increasing sales of snacks, many unhealthy, since March 2020, and this has been accompanied by less physical activity,” said Alison Tedstone, Chief Nutritionist of Public Health England (PHE). “PHE’s third annual report on sugar reduction in the UK highlighted how overall sugar in many food groups is continuing to rise, despite reductions by some businesses, and that the pace of change is too slow. As the emerging evidence on the severity of COVID-19 spotlights, increased weight gain and obesity appears to be a factor in the health risks. This further illustrates that strong action to support populations to become healthier is likely to also reduce the adverse outcomes.”

In this context, it is even more important to choose better policies and approaches that will contribute to well-being and protect people’s health. The severity and reach of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of interconnecting the strategic priorities outlined in the European Programme of Work 2020–2025: moving towards universal health coverage, protecting against health emergencies, and ensuring healthy lives and well-being for all at all ages.",,
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus transferred to humans from infected dromedary camels. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people, and it is contractable through direct or indirect contact with infected animals. MERS-CoV has been identified in dromedaries in several countries in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. In total, 27 countries have reported cases since 2012, leading to 858 known deaths due to the infection and related complications.



The origins of the virus are not fully understood but according to the analysis of different virus genomes it is believed that it may have originated in bats and later transmitted to camels at some point in the distant past.



Human-to-human transmission is possible, but only a few such transmissions have been found among family members living in the same household. In health care settings, however, human-to-human transmission appears to be more frequent.",,
WHO Regional Director's statement on COVID-19,"21 October 2020 – The situation with regards to COVID-19 in our Region is grave and concerning. Overall, there is a sharp increase in cases across the Region, with some countries – including Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Morocco, Jordan, Tunisia and Libya – recently documenting their highest single day number of cases since the start of the pandemic.

Some countries, such as Islamic Republic of Iran, are also recording the highest numbers of deaths.

The response to COVID-19 over the past 9 months has seen countries expand their capacities and resources to the limit, and communities trying to accept and live with the “new normal”.

But despite many impressive efforts to date, the current trend in the Region reflects that what we have done so far is not enough.

This unprecedented increase is a stark reminder that governments, communities and partners – including WHO – need to do much, much more to change the course of the pandemic.

But regrettably – and understandably – countries and populations are reaching higher levels of frustration and fatigue as the pandemic continues to ravage national economies and livelihoods.

We are seeing global movements against lockdowns; and adherence to behaviours that we know work in limiting the spread of the virus – especially mask use and physical distancing – remains insufficient, including in many countries of our Region.

With COVID-19 fatigue setting in, we expect the situation to further worsen, and the coming months will be tough on us all as the virus sees further opportunity to spread. The influenza season, which is expected to start soon, is likely to also aggravate the situation.

As more people become infected across the Region, the pressure on health workers and health systems will continue to increase as they struggle to meet the demands for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 services.

At a regional level, we monitor the increasing numbers of cases every day with concern and are adjusting our recommendations to countries based on the epidemiology and evolving context.

We need a more aggressive and targeted approach to surveillance, testing and contact tracing. And we need communities to be aware of the critical role they play in helping to stop the virus from spreading by adopting protective behaviours.

We are 9 months into the pandemic and it is still too soon to relax or revert to business as usual. The lives, livelihoods and welfare of millions of people are at stake, including those of our families and loved ones.

The choices we make in the coming days, weeks and months as individuals, communities, and countries, can ultimately decide whether we are collectively engulfed deeper into this deadly pandemic, or whether we collectively overcome the virus and recover.",,
Statement of the WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean on the closing of the 67th session of the Regional Committee,"13 October 2020 - I am pleased at the outset to welcome Her Excellency Dr. Hala Zayed, Minister of Health and Population of Egypt, and to congratulate Her Excellency on her election as Chair of the 67th session of the Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean.

The 67th session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean has just concluded. The Regional Committee is WHO’s supreme governing body in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. This year’s session took place in extraordinary circumstances, as everyone knows. Like the rest of the world, our Region has been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the huge challenges of trying to control the pandemic and contain its severe health, social and economic impacts while also continuing to address other public health problems and issues.

The Regional Committee convened almost 9 months into the pandemic, with participation from ministers of health and high-level representatives from the 22 countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region, partner organizations and the civil society. We also welcomed the contribution of WHO’s Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

This online meeting represented a significant and necessary chance for all of us to step back and review our approaches in dealing with COVID-19 pandemic, and to consider how to implement our regional strategy during the pandemic and beyond.

To date, more than 2.7 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported from all countries of the Region, with deaths exceeding 65 000. These numbers are rising at very alarming rates in several countries. Alongside the direct impact of mortality and morbidity from COVID-19, the pandemic is also having serious impacts on health services including immunization services, elective surgeries and treatment of chronic diseases as well as efforts to address other health emergencies and crises. It is no exaggeration to say that such impacts are more serious than the pandemic itself.

Over the past two days we have discussed at length many other issues affecting the health and well-being of our Region’s entire population. I was honoured to present the annual report on the work of WHO in the Region throughout 2019 and part of 2020, and the Committee also discussed a series of technical papers and reports.

Several draft resolutions have been proposed for the Regional Committee’s consideration, including:

A call for continued work, implementation and regular updating of Covid-19 national plans; ensuring accurately and timely reporting of data to WHO as per the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005); maintaining the national capacities required to early detect, test, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts and implement quarantine in case public health and social measures are suspended or re-enforced; securing safe water, hygiene and sanitation services; implementing measures of infection prevention and control (IPC); and preserving the functionality and strength of health systems to respond effectively to the pandemic and other outbreaks, especially during complex emergencies.

Establishing a new regional Subcommittee for Polio Eradication and Outbreaks to support the intensive efforts to eradicate this disease from the Region; provision of support to the remaining polio-endemic countries in the Region; and reporting annually to the Regional Committee, the Executive Board and the World Health Assembly on the current situation, progress and challenges until polio eradication is successfully certified regionally.

Establishing a procedure to grant accreditation to regional non-State actors not in official relationships with WHO so they can participate in future Regional Committee meetings, in line with the provisions of WHO’s framework of engagement with non-State actors (FENSA).

Adopting a new regional strategy to improve access to essential medicines and vaccines.

Adopting the annual report of the Regional Director for 2019 and endorsing the strategic framework of action to improve access to assistive technology in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and the strategic framework for the prevention and control of emerging and epidemic-prone infectious diseases.

We have agreed and pledged that this is the right time to redouble efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic and to build on these efforts in preparing for and responding to any epidemics or pandemics that may take place in the future.

We are determined to do so.

Today, we mark the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction. We must not forget that our Region is vulnerable to natural disasters that have a severe impact on people, communities, countries and health systems. In the past few months, Somalia, Sudan and Pakistan were hit by floods. This week alone, forest fires erupted along the Syrian coast, injuring dozens and forcing 100 000 people from their homes.

The impact of disasters, particularly in terms of mortality, injuries and displacement, can be reduced through good management of disaster risks. These issues came under the spotlight this year when countries found themselves ill prepared to manage global threats such as COVID-19 pandemic.

Through collaboration with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the Regional Office co-developed with countries a draft regional framework of action to operationalize the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015‒2030. The draft framework identifies clear actions that countries, communities individuals and institutions can take in order to improve means to minimize the current risks and avoid novel risks through strengthening the capacity of individuals, communities, countries and systems to better predict, control and recover from current and new disasters.

In closing, I assure you that we are committed to promoting the health and well-being of people across the Region.",,
Handwashing can’t stop – millions of lives are at stake,"Global Handwashing Day might seem a bit niche as international days go; you’d certainly be forgiven for never having marked it. But this year, today, it’s taken on a new urgency for millions of vulnerable children.

The coronavirus pandemic has built a fresh appreciation for clean, running water and soap in those of us fortunate enough to have access to them. Washing our hands more regularly is now second nature; maybe even humming the ‘happy birthday’ song twice to make sure we hit the 20-second recommended mark.

But this most simple of acts remains beyond the reach of millions of families around the world, and it’s putting their lives on the line. In 2019, three billion people lacked access to a handwashing facility with soap and water, including three quarters of those living in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, one in three health care facilities do not have hand hygiene facilities at points of care.

Staggeringly, if world leaders don't continue to invest in handwashing, we risk continuing to see more than a million children under five years old dying unnecessarily every single year.

It’s a stark warning. Thoroughly cleaning hands with soap or an alcohol-based hand rub helps prevent a range of diseases, including the biggest killers of under-fives globally: pneumonia and diarrhoea. These two diseases combined kill approximately 1,250,000 young children each year.

“Hands, face, space” has become the new mantra of the UK government’s campaign to prevent the virus. And as more countries re-open after lengthy lockdowns, continued handwashing is crucial to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 – while at the same time helping to prevent other killer diseases. But this will happen only if countries build on the increased investment in handwashing inspired by the pandemic.

Good hand hygiene is relatively cheap, and a cornerstone of safe and effective health care. Through the WHO/UNICEF Hand Hygiene for All initiative, we are urging global leaders to do everything they can to ensure it is both possible and promoted in homes, schools, healthcare facilities, care homes, workplaces and in public areas. Governments, community and faith leaders, the private sector, and others who can influence hygiene habits must take the lead in this. Otherwise we risk a deadly, continuous cycle of COVID-19, the genesis of further pandemics, and more needless deaths due to other infectious diseases.

We are at a critical juncture – what the global community does or does not do to sustain handwashing now could save or kill millions of vulnerable children, slow or drive the spread of antimicrobial resistance and also determine the first line of defence for adolescents, adults and the elderly.

Prior to COVID-19, handwashing with soap after using the toilet was reported at just 19 per cent globally. Investments in handwashing have increased significantly over the past few months as leaders have attempted to quickly stem the spread of the virus. One US study indicated the percentage of Americans who reported washing their hands six or more times per day increased from 37 per cent pre-coronavirus to 78 per cent in April 2020.

However, without durable, affordable, accessible and convenient ways for the most vulnerable to wash their hands, and policies that encourage it into the future, we fear that this vital behaviour will return to low pre-pandemic levels once the threat of COVID-19 subsides, or even before as the threat of behavioural fatigue looms.

Many aid agencies and governments are focusing on temporary solutions, such as trucking in water or distributing buckets. But if these are targeted only at this current crisis and fail to consider long-term sustainability, they will likely fail to bring about the lasting change needed to address other deadly diseases. Access to clean water and hygiene facilities must be urgently prioritised for every person, especially the most vulnerable families, with infrastructure built so this access is permanent. Crucially, creative and compelling messaging is desperately needed in many communities to motivate people to adopt hand hygiene as a critical life-long habit.

As we face a second wave of COVID-19, good hand hygiene benefits us all. But we can’t afford to return to business as usual when the virus no longer poses a threat; to do so would be to abandon the most vulnerable. Our message to world leaders is this: we have an opportunity to turn the tide on the major killers of children globally. We must not fail them.",,
Update COVID-19 26 October 2020,"26 October 2020 — Seven (7) new COVID-19 cases were identified out of 1736 samples tested today. This brings the cumulative number of confirmed cases to five thousand, and seventy-three (5073).

The new cases are in Kigali (5), and Nyagatare (1); heightened vigilance is required everywhere.

The COVID-19 prevention measures announced by the Government of Rwanda must continue to be rigorously observed, especially frequent hand-washing and physical distancing. In addition, face masks must be worn in public and multi-family compounds.

Withholding information related to contact tracing or COVID-19 symptoms, jeopardises public safety and will be punished in accordance with applicable laws.

Shoring up COVID-19 prevention in Nigeria’s border states,"Lagos, 27 October, 2020 - Border security officers in Nigeria already contend with a raft of challenges in deterring illegal traffic and ensuring safety. In Ogun state in the country’s south-west where the country’s first COVID-19 case was detected, they are now also helping to curb the importation of COVID-19.

Ogun state borders Benin and has about five official border crossings. It is a priority region in the battle against the virus of which there have been over 58 000 cases nationwide since February.

Having close links with the megacity of Lagos, Nigeria’s COVID-19 epicentre state accounting for a third of the country’s cases, Ogun’s position as a commercial hub of travel and trade makes it vulnerable to outbreaks, says Dr Adeniyi, the Officer-in-Charge at the Ogun State Port Health Service who in August led a team of health officers to step up COVID-19 prevention efforts in the state.

Over three days, the 11-member team covered about 80% of Ogun border areas educating border officers in Ayetoro, Oko Eye, Ajilete, Aja Odan, Ilaro and Owode border areas how to properly wear fabric masks, wash their hands and on the importance of physical distancing. In Ajilete, the team re-trained officers on how to properly collect COVID-19 samples for testing from suspected cases.

Among the COVID-19 prevention challenges, border officials say, is the poor access to information from online sources because of poor internet in rural border areas. They also cited the high cost of masks and sanitizers.

“The situation is that people relaxed and dropped their guards but with the coming of the health officers it woke us up again and since then we have been up and doing,” says A.C Adaeze, an Assistant Superintendent Customs officer posted to in Ilaro border crossing. “The health officials took the pain of going around sensitizing people and making corrections where necessary. They even gave us masks and personal hand sanitisers. l think they did well.”

Dr Adeniyi’s team also held discussions with border communities where compliance is low, but infection risk is high from travellers passing through numerous illegal routes that lead directly into communities.

“We let them know the danger of someone coming in and keeping quiet about it,” says Dr Sunday Dele Omoniyi Abidoye, World Health Organization (WHO) Ogun state coordinator who was also part of the advocacy team. Apart from COVID-19, Ogun is also at risk of other infectious diseases like polio, he says. In August 2020, Africa was certified free of wild polio four years after the continent’s last cases were detected in Nigeria.

Teams across the south-western border states of Lagos and Oyo are doing the same on land, at airports and at sea borders, which can be overlooked but pose huge risks. In Lagos, Nigeria’s economic capital, WHO official, Dr Edmund Ogbe, says his team working with Lagos Port Health Service, set up a screening system at the Apapa and Tin Can Island sea borders where cargo vessels continued to enter the country despite the border closure between March and September. His team boards a boat out to the water in the Gulf of Guinea to halt ships that have reported cases of coronavirus from docking at the ports in Lagos.

Religious and traditional leaders in border communities are cooperating, too.

“The results of the August campaign are starting to show in all south-west states,” says Dr Rosemary Onyibe, the WHO Zonal Coordinator. Compliance is Ogun is now 70% up from 25% before the team visited. “We’ve seen officers distribute information and education materials we provided to their colleagues and travellers coming into the country. WHO will continue to support states to achieve their goal.”

But a few challenges remain, according to Dr Onyibe. One of them is reaching remote border communities and convincing the many who believe that COVID-19 does not exist. Another is coordinating and harmonizing health data sent by border officials from various government security agencies, but she adds, WHO is ready to support states with sensitization, surveillance and logistics.

State officials are certain that adherence to guidelines will continue to increase with intense sensitization. Dr Adeniyi is already planning more advocacy meetings. “As long as the pandemic is still with us, we have to continue telling people that it’s not over until it’s over.”

South Sudan conducts a vaccination campaign to protect 93 000 people from yellow fever,"Juba, 26 October 2020 – It’s a busy Saturday morning and the second day of the reactive yellow fever vaccination campaign in Kajo-keji County, Central Equatoria State. At exactly 8:00 am, when the vaccination team opened the center, Mr Basenso Loro eagerly waiting to receive his first-ever dose of the vaccines walked in majestically with his four children and his wife to receive the vaccines they have longed for.

“When I was reliably informed by my friend that cases of yellow fever have been confirmed in Kajo-keji, as a parent, I became so worried, I thought that I and my family members were going to be infected,” said Mr Loro a 53-year-old resident of Rego village, Nyepo Payam, Kajo-keji County which is one of the five counties where the yellow fever vaccines are being administered.

“On Friday when I heard the vaccines have reached our village and we were to receive it for free, I became very excited and wanted to be the first to receive along with my family members. I’m so excited the vaccines came at the right time. I’m also confident that I’m protected from this disease” Mr Loro narrated.

“We never knew this vaccine was being brought to us, some of my friends crossed to neighboring Uganda where similar vaccination is ongoing to receive the vaccines” Loro added.

Ensuring the community is protected

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Health with support from Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) partners including Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, WHO, UNICEF and other partners launched a reactive yellow fever vaccination campaign in Kajo, Keji, Central Equatoria State.

The campaign aims to protect over 90 000 individuals aged 9 months to 60 years from yellow fever infection in Kajo Keji County. Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever and a single dose of WHO approved yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease.

The 5-day campaign that started on 23 October 2020 is being implemented within the national and WHO guidelines for implementing mass vaccination campaigns in the context of COVID-19.

In February this year, the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, commissioned a cross-border outbreak investigation in Kajo-keji county after a yellow fever outbreak was declared in the bordering Moyo district, Uganda. A total of two laboratory-confirmed yellow fever cases were reported in March 2020 after the completion of comprehensive investigations in Kajo Keji County.

The plans to conduct an emergency yellow fever campaign were delayed after South Sudan confirmed the first COVID-19 cases in early April 2020. The campaign plans were reactivated in August 2020 following the completion of guidelines on conducting vaccination campaigns in the context of COVID-19. Consequently, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on yellow fever vaccines approved 103 230 doses of yellow fever vaccines for the emergency campaign in Kajo-keji.

The reactive yellow fever vaccination is part of the global strategy to Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics by 2026. Based on the EYE strategy initiative, South Sudan is classified as a high risk country and thus, the strategic yellow fever control requirements entail: maintaining high population immunity; monitoring population immunity; case-based surveillance and laboratory testing; rapid response to outbreaks; targeting travelers in compliance with IHR (2005); and strengthening health systems readiness.

South Sudan last experienced yellow fever outbreak in November 2018 in Sakure Payam, Western Equatoria State. In response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Health with support from WHO, UNICEF and partners vaccinated over 19 500 individuals aged 9 months to 65 years against yellow fever.

In the last couple of years, WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, UNICEF and partners intensified the preventive measures for high-risk areas, including the inclusion of the yellow fever vaccine into the national childhood routine immunization, review application process to fund implementation of country control strategies and review as well as update the national yellow fever vaccination requirements for international travelers.

In line with the EYE strategy requirement to mitigate the risk of cross-border yellow fever spread from high risk countries, WHO has supported the Ministry of Health with an additional 2,000 doses of yellow fever vaccines for international travelers.

“Yellow fever vaccination is mandated by the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005)”, said Dr Olushayo Olu, WHO Representative for South Sudan. “The yellow fever vaccines, which is being delivered with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will protect against the yellow fever virus and prevent the spread of the virus.

Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne acute viral hemorrhagic disease and has an incubation period of 3-6 days following infection. The infection can range from mild to severe.

Mild symptoms of yellow fever include fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal and muscle pains. More severe symptoms include hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever. Vaccination is the best protection against the virus and provides lifelong immunity.

In line with the IHR (2005) and the EYE strategy, the South Sudan Ministry of Health continues to implement yellow fever surveillance and response activities within the context of the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy. The IDSR strategy supports case based surveillance, testing, and response to suspect and confirmed yellow fever cases. The implementation of IDSR in South Sudan is supported by WHO with funding from United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and EU Humanitarian Aid (ECHO).

Benin boosts COVID-19 response with increased testing,"Cotonou, 22 October 2020 – Benin’s first COVID-19 case was diagnosed at the Viral Haemorrhagic Fever Laboratory in the capital Cotonou in March 2020. Then it was the country’s sole facility able to test for the virus. At best it could carry out only 300 tests per day.

In the early phase of the pandemic, Benin, like many African countries, lacked adequate COVID-19 testing. Over the recent months, governments across the continent have ramped up diagnosis, which is crucial in understanding the scale and trend of COVID-19 infections as well as guiding public health measures against the virus.

From the single laboratory in the capital city, Benin now has 13 laboratories capable of testing for COVID-19, with all its 12 departments having at least one. It also currently ranks among the 12 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region carrying out more than 10 tests per 10 000 people per week.

A range of strategies have boosted Benin’s COVID-19 response. Triage and testing centres have been set up across the country’s 77 communes as well as in health facilities, airport and land border crossings. Mobile testing teams also carry out diagnosis in government offices and in private companies, while a hotline provides access to COVID-19 information and assistance.

Through polymerase chain reaction tests – the reference for COVID-19 testing – and rapid diagnostic tests, Benin is carrying out around 7900 tests per week, and has done more than 222 000 tests cumulatively, says Dr Ange Dodji Dossou, the national director of medical services.

“A network of testing centres has been set up across the country to detect, issue alerts and trace people suspected to have contracted COVID-19,” Dr Dossou explains.

The government, in collaboration with WHO, in April stepped up the diagnostic capacity of the Viral Haemorrhagic Fever Laboratory to make it a reference laboratory. Working with the Institut Pasteur, Senegal’s pre-eminent laboratory, and the Virology Institute at Berlin’s Charité University Hospital has also uplifted COVID-19 testing in Benin.

“This has placed the Viral Haemorrhagic Fever Laboratory among the reference COVID-19 testing laboratories such as Institut Pasteur in Dakar or the one in Johannesburg,” says Dr Mamoudou Harouna Djingarey, WHO interim representative in Benin.

A US$ 30-million funding mobilized with World Bank as well as support from other partners has helped to modernize the Cotonou-based laboratory and 10 other health facilities across the country, five of which have been transformed into treatment centres and intensive care for COVID-19 patients, Dr Djingarey explains.

In addition, WHO, working with partner organizations, has supplied reagents, sample collection and testing kits as well as personal protective equipment to boost the COVID-19 response in Benin.

The Viral Haemorrhagic Fever Laboratory can now provide COVID-19 test results based on polymerase chain reaction method in six hours using 15 real-time polymerase chain reaction diagnostic machines.

With 2557 cases so far and 41 deaths, Benin has made significant efforts in curbing COVID-19. “In Africa where we have many asymptomatic cases, only through mass testing can governments qualitatively assess the evolution of the virus and gather reliable information to steer response strategies,” Dr Yadouleton points out.

The improvements being made in COVID-19 testing also need to outlive the pandemic, says Dr Djingarey.

“Our goal is that the laboratories should remain operational post-COVID-19 so as to test for other disease and form part of the global flu surveillance network, early warning and diagnosis as well as effective response in case of new outbreaks in Benin.”",,
Testing at the core of Gabon’s COVID-19 battle,"Libreville – With over 60 sample collection sites, a network of laboratories, including a high-capacity one, Gabon has tested nearly a tenth of its 2 million people for COVID-19. Diagnosis has been expanded through mass testing and decentralization beyond the capital city. Many African countries registered their initial COVID-19 cases in their capitals, as such response strategies, including testing, were concentrated in the major urban areas. In Gabon, testing centres were initially set up in Libreville, including at the airport and the capital city’s hospitals, including military, as well as health centres. Mobile sample collection teams were also formed to complement the testing centres. At the onset of the pandemic, the health authorities focused on testing symptomatic patients and their contacts and patients with comorbidities. President Ali Bongo Ondimba made mass testing a priority in COVID-19 response. Testing was increased through additional laboratories and sample collection centres established across the country, while a high-capacity laboratory was set up in the capital Libreville capable of carrying out up to 10 000 tests a day. “The benefits of these improvements are undeniable since the entire response strategy is based on the performance of this [high-capacity] laboratory,” says Professor Romain Tchoua, the technical coordinator of Gabon’s COVID-19 response committee. “The laboratory handles more than three quarters of tests with samples from different regions.” Since July, Gabon has been conducting more than 2000 tests daily compared with around 200 tests a week earlier in the year following the first confirmed cases. There are now 15 laboratories across the country, and with the support of World Health Organization (WHO) and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 50 experts from various laboratories were trained in COVID-19 testing and biosafety. They then later trained more than 80 technicians working in COVID-19 testing centres. With the increased diagnostic capacity, the time it takes to receive COVID-19 test results has also been drastically reduced. “Since the establishment of the laboratories in Libreville as well as in the provincial capitals, test results are delivered between 24 and 48 hours at the latest. We even now have three different types of PCR [polymerase chain reaction] technologies, some of which can give results within six hours,” says Dr Armel Mintsa Ndong, deputy director of the National Public Health Laboratory. While COVID-19 diagnosis has improved significantly, isolating and treating patients needs to be improved to conform with the response strategy comprising testing, tracing and isolating patients, says Dr Magaran Monzon Bagayoko, WHO representative in Gabon. Gabon is among the 12 countries in Africa carrying out more than 10 tests per 100 000 people per week – a critical threshold for testing in the region. As COVID-19 restrictions are being eased, the health authorities are stressing the importance of maintaining vigilance. “With the downward trend in cases, screening should be ramped up more than ever,” says Dr Magaran. “We are seeing a resurgence of a second wave of the virus in many countries that have links with Gabon. Currently 1% of arriving passengers test positive [for COVID-19]. Therefore, checks at arrivals must be stepped up to limit imported cases and reduce positive cases.” Gabon’s Minister of Health, Guy Patrick Obiang, while voicing satisfaction with the progress the country has made in curbing the spread of the virus, warned that “we cannot relax. We are aware that to bring the situation under control, we must maintain and indeed strengthen the measures against COVID-19.”",,
New COVID-19 rapid tests a game changer for Africa,"Brazzaville – The roll-out of new, World Health Organization (WHO) approved antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests for the novel coronavirus in Africa will significantly boost testing capacity and marks a game changer in the continent’s fight against COVID-19.

Many African countries have struggled to test in sufficient numbers to control the pandemic, with only 12 in the region reaching a key threshold of 10 tests per 10 000 people per week during the past month. They have also often fallen short when compared to other countries of a similar size in a different region. For example, Senegal has significantly boosted its testing capacity but is testing 14 times less than the Netherlands. Nigeria is testing 11 times less than Brazil.

“The widespread use of high-quality rapid testing in Africa can revolutionize the continent’s response to COVID-19,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “The new, antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests will help meet the huge testing needs in Africa.”

Most countries in the region conduct polymerase chain reaction or PCR tests, the gold standard, which require laboratories, reagents and experts, limiting COVID-19 testing mostly to large cities. People can wait from 48 hours to more than ten days for results as they are sent for laboratory verification.

The new rapid tests are easy to use, cheaper than PCR tests and provide the results in just 15–30 minutes, enabling countries to decentralize testing.

“Most African countries are focused on testing travellers, patients or contacts, and we estimate that a significant number of cases are still missed. With rapid testing, authorities can stay a step ahead of COVID-19 by scaling up active case finding in challenging environments, such as crowded urban neighbourhoods and communities in the hinterlands.” said Dr Moeti.

Rapid antigen tests are an addition to PCR tests, not a replacement for them, and WHO recommends tests that are above 80% accurate. They are more reliable in patients who are symptomatic, with a high viral load, or a lot of virus in their upper respiratory tract.

Currently the two tests which WHO has approved for emergency use are the “standard Q COVID-19 Antigen Test by SD Biosensor Inc” and the “Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Device” manufactured by Abbott. They test for proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. Bodily fluids are taken from a nasal swab and applied with liquid to a paper strip, where a dye gives the result.

WHO recommends that rapid antigen tests should be used in four scenarios: in suspected outbreaks where there is no access to PCR testing, including in remote, hard-to-reach areas; to trace the extent of an outbreak where at least one case is detected through PCR, including in close-contact settings such as prisons; among high-risk groups like health workers; and in areas with widespread community transmission.

Globally, 120 million of these tests are being made available to low- and middle-income countries through the ACT-Accelerator, a coalition launched by WHO and partners, comprising international organizations, the private sector and philanthropy. It aims to expedite the development, production and availability of promising tests, vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Under the umbrella of the ACT-Accelerator, UNITAID, the Global Fund, FIND and the Africa Centres for Disease Control will distribute the tests in 20 African countries. WHO is also supporting countries to procure the tests through the supply portal set up by the United Nations.

WHO is working hand in hand with countries and partners to prepare for the roll out of the rapid tests by deploying technical experts, developing a training package and issuing key guidance documents with detailed information on which situation and how to use the tests.

Dr Moeti spoke during a virtual press conference today facilitated by APO Group. She was joined by Dr Abdoulaye Toure, Director-General of the National Institute of Public Health, Guinea; and Dr Susan Ndidde Nabadda, Head of the Ugandan National Health Laboratory Services and Central Public Health Laboratory.",,
Battling COVID-19 in communities,"Kampala – In a low-income suburb of Makindye, in the Ugandan capital, Hakim Kiggundu has gathered a group of around 30 people from the community near his home, under a tree in a clearing among the houses. In this tight-knit community of narrow mud roads and small wooden houses, people are used to living cheek-by-jowl, but now they are sitting on neatly-spaced white plastic chairs, a few metres apart.

Kiggundu is here as part of the local village health team to educate people about COVID-19 – how to identify signs and symptoms and stay safe. A brief round of applause concludes a question-and-answer session before Kiggundu continues spreading the message, making house-to-house visits throughout the area. Makindye has in the past been divided into zones, with each assigned to one village health team to monitor outbreaks such as cholera or measles as well provide HIV counselling and prevention. Since the COVID-19 onset, there are now four teams per zone.

At first it was hard to persuade people that the disease was real, and that it could affect them, says Kiggundu. But as COVID-19 cases surged in recent weeks, reaching areas hitherto unaffected, the message has been more urgent to help change perceptions about the virus. “People understand because we teach them in our local language, Luganda,” Kiggundu points out.

The village health teams are trained volunteers who form part of the backbone of Uganda’s public health system. In the capital Kampala, there are more than 4000 volunteers in the various health teams. Their job is to communicate to people in their neighbourhoods about any outbreaks, how to avoid them, what signs and symptoms to look out for, and what to do if they fall ill or see people with symptoms.

Community involvement is crucial to the success of preventive measures such as handwashing, wearing masks and physical distancing, says Dr Dansan Atim, a senior medical officer with the surveillance division at the Ugandan Ministry of Health. “If we need to combat this pandemic then we need to involve everyone,” he says. “These [preventive measures] are the things to be implemented by the community. So their engagement is important … in the fight against COVID.”

Although safety messages were being broadcast through radio and television, having a trusted person come to distribute free cloth masks, answer questions and demonstrate correct hand hygiene wins people’s confidence and trust in health messages, says mother-of-two Rebecca Nalubwala after a visit by Kiggundu from the village health team.

“We trust him because he's a boy who grew up here. He has no bad intention towards us in our community. Hakim and the group teach people who have no access to television and radio,” Nalubwala says.

Uganda had recorded 9945 cumulative COVID-19 cases as of 13 October and currently has 765 active cases. The country witnessed a rise in infections from early August, but the numbers have been declining over the last three weeks.

With support from World Health Organization, village health teams across Kampala and neighbouring Wakiso district have received specialized training in surveillance and community outreach to better convey safety message in these areas where there has been an increase in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks. Dr Atim hopes that the training will help to improve reporting of COVID-19 cases.

Despite his 12 years’ experience in community outreach, Kiggundu believes the training has changed his approach to communication, which he says will also be useful in responding to other outbreaks by encouraging people to report symptoms to him and his colleagues or seek medical help.

“I learned more about detection and responding. You have to go and see if your community makes you aware that we have this pandemic, or we have this outbreak,” he explains. “We make them aware. That they be alert if they see any sign or symptom about any disease.”",,
"COVID-19 halting crucial mental health services in Africa, WHO survey","Brazzaville – Critical funding gaps are halting and disrupting crucial mental health services in Africa, as demand for these services rise amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a new World Health Organization (WHO) survey shows.

The survey of 28 African countries was undertaken as part of the first global examination of the devastating impact of COVID-19 on access to mental health services. It underscores the urgent need for increased funding. Of the countries responding in the African region, 37% reported that their COVID-19 mental health response plans are partially funded and a further 37% reported having no funds at all.

This comes as the COVID-19 pandemic increases demand for mental health services.

“Isolation, loss of income, the deaths of loved ones and a barrage of information on the dangers of this new virus can stir up stress levels and trigger mental health conditions or exacerbate existing ones,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “The COVID-19 pandemic has shown, more than ever, how mental health is integral to health and well-being and must be an essential part of health services during outbreaks and emergencies.”

African countries account for 15 of the top 30 countries globally for suicide per 100 000 people. While there is scant data on how COVID-19 is increasing mental health conditions on the African continent, one study in South Africa found that 10–20% of the 220 people surveyed reported potent experiences of anxiety and fear as a result of the pandemic. Another survey of 12 000 women in low-income communities in Uganda and Zambia found an increase in persistent stress, anxiety and depression.

The WHO assessment of mental health services took place in July and August 2020 and 27 of the 28 African nations which responded have included mental health in their COVID-19 response plans, underscoring the growing recognition of the importance of this once neglected area of health.

In Africa, substance use disorder services were the mental health services facing the biggest disruptions. The main causes for the disruptions were due to patients failing to turn up, travel restrictions hindering access to health facilities and a decrease in patient volume due to cancellations of elective care.

While at the global level, up to 70% of countries have responded to the challenges posed by COVID-19 with telemedicine, in Africa governments have set up counselling helplines and increased training for key health responders in basic psychosocial skills.

Even before the pandemic, the region had one of the lowest mental health public expenditure rates, at less than US$ 10 cents per capita.

With increasing pressure on health systems and rising demand, stretched and chronically underfunded mental health services are under increasing strain.

“COVID-19 is adding to a long-simmering mental health care crisis in Africa. Leaders must urgently invest in life-saving mental health care services,” said Dr Moeti.

“We also need more action to provide better mental health information and education, to boost and expand services, and to enhance social and financial protection for people with mental disorders, including laws to ensure human rights for everyone.”

The WHO Regional Office for Africa has released guidance on managing COVID-19 and mental health for health workers and the general public. WHO is assisting African governments in responding to the pandemic as fits their unique circumstances.

COVID-19 in Africa: marking six months of response,"On 14 February 2020, Africa confirmed its first COVID-19 case in Egypt. Since then, more than 1 million cases have been reported and every country on the continent has been affected. African governments were quick to adopt public health measures in line with WHO guidelines and instituted other restrictions such as lockdowns and curfews. While most countries have been spared the exponential growth witnessed in other regions, these measures have come at a heavy social and economic cost and as countries have started to open their borders, some have started to see cases rise.

WHO is coordinating the regional response, providing advice on critical preparedness, readiness and response measures for COVID-19 as well as diagnostics, surveillance, treatment and community engagement.",,

Enhancing diagnosis to beat COVID-19 in Senegal,"Dakar – Senegal’s Institut Pasteur was one of only two laboratories in Africa able to test for COVID-19 at the onset of the pandemic in early 2020. The institution’s director, Dr Amadou Sall, speaks about the efforts Senegal has made to strengthen testing as well as the challenges faced.

What measures have been taken to step up COVID-19 diagnosis in Senegal?

Three major strategies anchor the efforts to bolster COVID-19 testing: delivering test results within 24 hours once samples are received by the laboratory. This has been possible due to the streamlining of laboratory operations from receiving samples to issuing results. A 24-hour operation every day of the week, and the automation of processes at every stage possible.

Secondly, we also have a digital platform through which health workers can receive results from the surveillance teams, while travellers can receive their results digitally as soon as they are ready. We can act quickly and take the necessary steps.

Thirdly, COVID-19 response has also been decentralized to the districts. This has made setting up of laboratories and sample collection [locally] in most regions possible, cutting down on transportation delays [to far-away laboratories]. Laboratory testing has been decentralized to eight regions in the country thanks to the support of WHO, IDB [Islamic Development Bank] and the government.

What has been the impact of the testing strategy on the COVID-19 response?

At the onset of the pandemic, this strategy helped us to quickly identify clusters [of cases] and transfer patients for treatment in time. It helped to prevent and halt several chains of transmission.

When we reached the level of community transmission, the strategy allowed us to quickly identify and isolate confirmed cases among symptomatic patients. High-risk contacts and vulnerable people were also identified and protected thanks to this strategy.

Lastly it has also prevented the exportation of confirmed cases to other countries.

What are the challenges and how do you resolve them?

We face two major challenges. First, sample collection kits and personal protective equipment that are in short supply due to heightened global demand. The whole supply chain has been affected. Secondly, the personnel and logistics needed for effective testing.

We have a continuous recruitment process and training to ensure that we have enough personnel. For supplies, we do regular resource mobilization and work with major institutions to procure reagents, supplies and equipment.

Keeping displaced persons safe from COVID-19 in South Sudan,"As the world’s youngest country readied measures to prevent widespread COVID-19 infections, its years of conflict and natural disasters suddenly presented an unparalleled challenge: protecting thousands of displaced persons from COVID-19 within the sites set up over the past decade as refuge.

Of the 1.7 million displaced persons in the country, nearly 168 000 currently live in one of the 116 camps or settlements, where conditions meant physical distancing is virtually impossible. Basic services in camps can sometimes be limited, with water, sanitation and hygiene services as well as food and shelter supply outstripped by the needs of camp residents.

Just like much of the country, many of the displaced persons sites have inadequate health care provision and limited ability to care for severely sick patients.

“The COVID-19 outbreak poses an enormous threat to vulnerable populations in camps and settlements, where overcrowded living conditions and inadequate access to social services challenge effective coronavirus prevention and control,” says Dr Olushayo Olu, World Health Organization (WHO) Representative for South Sudan.

Having moved into the camps away from civil conflict, war, famine and /or flooding, the residents thought staying put was their safest option. “I believed if things are going to get worse, then I would rather be here under [the United Nations Mission in South Sudan protection], where I know they will have to do something rather than me going away and most likely face difficulties I’m not equipped to handle,” explains a leader of the 1921 residents of Bor Protection of Civilian Site in Jonglei State.

Preventing the coronavirus from reaching any community in the country or the camps became a priority of the government, the United Nations and local and international non-government organizations – all coming together in response.

As the global health agency, WHO coordinated their activities, which revolved around building trust, introducing transmission-prevention measures, maintaining continuity of health services and supplies and establishing separate dedicated COVID-19 treatment and isolation centres.

“The South Sudan national COVID -19 response plan addressed the needs of displaced persons camps and settlements, and WHO provided guidelines, tools and kits to partners to facilitate enhanced case and mortality surveillance. This allowed rapid identification, testing and isolation of cases as well as contact listing and quarantine to prevent the risk of widespread outbreaks,” explains Dr Joseph Wamala, Country Preparedness and International Health Regulations Officer for WHO South Sudan in Juba.

Protecting people in overcrowded conditions

By the end of March, a nationwide awareness-raising campaign through radio and SMS messaging was urgently explaining the virus and how people could best protect themselves and their family. The campaign extended into the displaced persons camps and settlements, where leaders, teachers, outreach volunteers, local committees and partners were also engaged to help protect their camp communities.

WHO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and other partners, supported the training of nearly 400 health care workers in the camps and settlements on caring for COVID-19 patients and how to prevent and control the spread of the virus.

Any resident of a camp or a settlement for the displaced confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 and in need of isolation or treatment in a dedicated facility is referred to government-run facilities. Given their limited capacity, additional isolation facilities were established for every camp and settlement hosting more than 5000 individuals. The United Nations is supporting 14 isolation centres for displacement camps and settlements.

In mid-April, South Sudan closed its schools, suspended internal flights between states and established a curfew. The camps and settlements were included in the lockdown in a bid to reduce movement and the potential spread of the virus.

Community leaders in some camps took ownership of certain containment measures, such as gate control and deciding who, when and how people enter the camp. WHO and other partners provided supplies for temperature screening of residents at the camp entry locations.

Contact tracing and fears

The Government initiated contact tracing soon after the first cases was detected on 5 April. The first four confirmed cases were United Nations workers.

Dr John Odong, a Sudanese medical doctor trained by WHO in the epidemiology, prevention and control of COVID-19, works with 40 other professionals in the country’s contact tracing team. “From April, we followed up contacts daily for 14 days or more, reporting any signs and symptoms. We collected samples, listed contacts and undertook community awareness on COVID-19.”

It hasn’t been easy, he adds. “Frequently we face negative reactions and even violence. People were, and still are, afraid – worried by the stigma of being infected.”

Dr Odong, who previously worked extensively in cholera outbreak response and especially with affected communities, found contact tracing particularly difficult among the displaced persons in camps and settlements due to the congestion and sheer number of potential contacts involved.

But working in teams of ten professionals, he and colleagues not only traced contacts inside and outside the camps and settlements but addressed the concerns of the residents.

“Despite some threats and the difficult working conditions, we have managed to get through to people. We have provided health education and psychological support to relieve them from stigma and fear of COVID,” he says.

No large outbreak to date

So far South Sudan’s vulnerable displaced populations have not experienced a huge number of COVID-19 cases. The prevention and control measures taken appear to have helped. As of 30 September, only 59 cases among displaced persons had been confirmed from the camps and settlements. And as of 12 October, the country had recorded 2798 cases of COVID-19 and 55 deaths.",,
Coping with mental health impact of COVID-19,"Kampala – Dan Bukenya felt beleaguered by anguish. He lost sleep most nights and was often testy. He tried to self-medicate to no avail. Only when he agreed to be treated at a hospital did he find relief. “They gave me medicines and I could finally sleep.”

Three weeks earlier, the 32-year-old father of one had been diagnosed with COVID-19 but was unwilling to seek medical help. The days that followed grew more distressful. He would work long hours to try to forget his diagnosis. But the agony persisted. “I would want to fight everyone. I was so angry all the time,” says Bukenya, who became too dispirited to preach the gospel – something he was fond of doing when not selling phones and other electronics at his shop in Nakasero Market in Kampala.

When he finally checked in at a hospital, he was found to also be suffering a mental disorder. COVID-19 is associated with neurological and mental complications such as delirium, agitation, stroke, insomnia, anxiety or depression, according to a recent World Health Organization (WHO) study. The many restrictions imposed to slow down the spread of the virus – physical distancing, lockdowns, closure of “non-essential” businesses, travel restrictions – also led to increased levels of stress, anxiety and depression.

Although no public data exists yet in Uganda on the extent of the pandemic’s impact on mental health, some doctors report an increasing number of patients treated for mental illness following the onset of COVID-19 in the country. “I see between 10 and 15 patients a day which is a small proportion of all the patients who are admitted. I would see many more if the PPE (personal protective equipment) we are required to wear in the ward would not make interactions so challenging,” says Dr Joseph Okurut, psychiatrist clinical officer at Entebbe Hospital. “Most of the patients never had mental health issues.”

The pandemic also disrupted the already limited mental health services in many African countries, with patients avoiding seeking services in hospitals for fear of contracting the virus. Cancellation of elective medical services also saw the number of patients drop, while restricted movement hindered people from going to health facilities.

In Uganda, like most African countries, mental healthcare was already weak before the epidemic. The country has only 47 psychiatrics, most of whom are based in Kampala, for a population of 42 million. Mental health services are mainly concentrated around the capital city. Furthermore, mental health units at the regional referral hospitals have been turned into isolation and treatment centres for COVID-19.

Dr Florence Baingana, WHO Regional Advisor for Mental Health and Substance Abuse, explained that while most African countries have mental health and psychosocial support in their COVID-19 response plans, very often additional budget was not fully allocated to implement these plans, and report insufficient health workers, medical supplies, medicines and personal protective equipment.

To strengthen mental health and psychosocial support as part of COVID-19 response, health authorities in Uganda are increasing personnel and funding. A team of 35 counsellors have been deployed to the Central Region, where the capital Kampala is located, and up to three mental health care workers are attached to every quarantine site, says Dr Kenneth Kalani, head of the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support unit in the Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 task force. “Around 230 psychosocial workers have been trained across the country to ensure mental health and psychosocial support services are operational.”

However, once patients are discharged many cannot afford to return for a follow-up consultation. Other means of reaching patients such as teleconsultation are already being implemented. In addition, a helpline is also to be launched to allow monitoring of discharged patients.

Through the helpline, COVID-19 survivors will receive automatically-generated calls two days, two weeks and six weeks after leaving the hospital. Depending on their answers to a raft of questions, they may be asked to return for a proper screening and a potential referral to a hospital.

Much remains to be learned about the long-term impact of COVID-19, says Dr Noeline Nakasujja, member of the Ministry of Health’s scientific advisory committee on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support. “We are not sure of the long-lasting effects of the pandemic on people.”

For Bukenya, who has recovered from COVID-19 and is soon to end his mental health treatment, a touch of reminiscence and regret sum up his ordeal. “I miss those days when I couldn’t fear anything. I don’t think I will ever be like I was before.”",,
Older Adults and COVID-19,"Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.

It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:

Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.

Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.

If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours

Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.

As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.

Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a mask cloth, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing masks or ask others around you to wear masks.

Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:

When to delay or cancel a visit

Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. So, think about:

How many people will you interact with?

Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?

Will you be outdoors or indoors?

What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?

Encourage social distancing during your visit

Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing.

, when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing. Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.

Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.

Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing masks or ask others around you to wear masks.

Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contact tracing if someone becomes sick.

Wear masks

Masks should be worn over the nose and mouth. Masks are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.

Masks may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others Wearing a mask helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.

Who should NOT use masks: Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Wash hands often

Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.

If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.

Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.

Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items

Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.

Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.

If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.

More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear masks, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.

Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.

It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

Remember the importance of staying physically active and practicing healthy habits to cope with stress.

If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan:",2/11/20 0:00,

How CDC Is Making COVID-19 Vaccine Recommendations,"ballot check light icon ACIP Resources: Meeting agendas, minutes, live meetings, and presentation slides

Since the pandemic began, ACIP has been holding special meetings to review U.S. data on COVID-19 and the vaccines in development to help prevent it. Before making recommendations, ACIP plans to review all available clinical trial information, including descriptions of

Who is receiving each candidate vaccine (age, race, ethnicity, underlying medical conditions)

How different groups respond to the vaccine

Side effects experienced

If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes or approves a COVID-19 vaccine, ACIP will quickly hold a meeting to review all available data about that vaccine. From these data, ACIP will then vote on whether to recommend the vaccine and, if so, who should receive it. Included in ACIP’s recommendations will be guidance on who should receive COVID-19 vaccines if supply is limited. Recommendations must go to the director of CDC for approval before becoming official CDC policy.

Goals for vaccination if supply is limited

ACIP has set the following goals for deciding who to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for if supply is limited:

Decrease death and serious disease as much as possible

Preserve functioning of society

Reduce the extra burden the disease is having on people already facing disparities

Increase the chance for everyone to enjoy health and well-being

Ethical principles

ACIP is setting ethical principles to guide their decision-making process on who to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for if supply is limited. Early discussions have focused on the following five principles:

Maximize benefits and minimize harms — Respect and care for people using the best available data to promote public health and minimize death and serious disease.

— Respect and care for people using the best available data to promote public health and minimize death and serious disease. Equity — Decrease health disparities and make sure everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible.

— Decrease health disparities and make sure everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. Justice — Treat affected groups, populations, and communities fairly. Remove unfair, unjust, and avoidable barriers to good health and well-being.

— Treat affected groups, populations, and communities fairly. Remove unfair, unjust, and avoidable barriers to good health and well-being. Fairness — Give everyone in a priority group an equal chance to get COVID-19 vaccination.

— Give everyone in a priority group an equal chance to get COVID-19 vaccination. Transparency — Make a decision that is clear, understandable, and open for review. Allow and seek public participation in the creation and review of the decision processes.

Groups considered for early vaccination if supply is limited

ACIP is considering four groups to possibly recommend COVID-19 vaccination for if supply is limited:

Healthcare personnel

Workers in essential and critical industries

People at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease due to underlying medical conditions

People 65 years and older

Healthcare personnel continue to be on the front line of the nation’s fight against this deadly pandemic. By providing critical care to those infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, many healthcare personnel have a high risk of being exposed to and getting sick with COVID-19. Healthcare personnel who get COVID-19 are also at risk of spreading the virus to patients seeking care for medical conditions that increase their risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Early vaccine access is critical to ensuring the health and safety of this essential workforce of approximately 20 million people, protecting not only them but also their patients and the broader health of our country. Learn who is included under the broad term “healthcare personnel.”

Workers in essential and critical industries are considered part of America’s critical infrastructure, as defined by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agencyexternal icon. Current data show that many of these workers are at increased risk for COVID-19. Early vaccine access is critical not only to protect them but also to maintain the essential services they provide U.S. communities.

People with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease, regardless of their age. Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or that they may even die. Early vaccine access is critical to ensuring the health and safety of this population that is disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

Among adults, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk. Early vaccine access is critical to help protect this population that is disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

Ensuring the Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States,"The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Safety is a top priority while federal partners work to make a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine(s) available.

Clinical Trials

Currently, clinical trials are evaluating investigational COVID-19 vaccines in many thousands of study participants to generate scientific data and other information for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to determine their safety and effectiveness. These clinical trials are being conducted according to the rigorous standards set forth by FDA in their June 2020 guidance document, Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19external icon. If FDA determines that a vaccine meets its safety and effectiveness standards, it can make these vaccines available for use in the United States by approval or emergency use authorization.

After FDA makes its determination, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will review available data before making vaccine recommendations to CDC. Learn more about how CDC is making COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.

Vaccine Safety Monitoring

After a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, many vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events (possible side effects). This continued monitoring can pick up on adverse events that may not have been seen in clinical trials. If an unexpected adverse event is seen, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. Experts then decide whether changes are needed in U.S. vaccine recommendations. This monitoring is critical to help ensure that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks for people who receive vaccines.

FDA’s June 2020 guidance document also includes important recommendations for ongoing safety evaluation after any COVID-19 vaccine is made available in the United States.

CDC is working to expand safety surveillance through new systems and additional information sources, as well as by scaling up existing safety monitoring systems.

Expanded Safety Monitoring Systems

The following systems and information sources add an additional layer of safety monitoring, giving CDC and FDA the ability to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine safety in real time and make sure COVID-19 vaccines are as safe as possible:

Cleaning and Disinfection for Households,"Summary of Recent Changes Revisions were made on 3/26/2020 to reflect the following: Updated links to EPA-registered disinfectant list

Added guidance for disinfection of electronics

Updated core disinfection/cleaning guidance

Background

There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is currently known about COVID-19, spread from person-to-person of this virus happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets. On the other hand, transmission of novel coronavirus to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through objects and surfaces, like doorknobs, countertops, keyboards, toys, etc. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings.

It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air.

Purpose

This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of households where persons under investigation (PUI) or those with confirmed COVID-19 reside or may be in self- isolation. It is aimed at limiting the survival of the virus in the environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.

These guidelines are focused on household settings and are meant for the general public.

Cleaning refers to the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection.

refers to the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting refers to using chemicals, for example, EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection.

General recommendations for routine cleaning and disinfection of households

Community members can practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks, and electronics (see below for special electronics cleaning and disinfection instructions)) with household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants external icon that are appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product. For electronics follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.

Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.

General recommendations for cleaning and disinfection of households with people isolated in home care (e.g. suspected/confirmed to have COVID-19)

Household members should educate themselves about COVID-19 symptoms and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in homes.

Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, keyboards, handles, desks, toilets, sinks) In the bedroom/bathroom dedicated for an ill person: consider reducing cleaning frequency to as-needed (e.g., soiled items and surfaces) to avoid unnecessary contact with the ill person.

As much as possible, an ill person should stay in a specific room and away from other people in their home, following home care guidance.

The caregiver can provide personal cleaning supplies for an ill person’s room and bathroom, unless the room is occupied by child or another person for whom such supplies would not be appropriate. These supplies include tissues, paper towels, cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants (see examples external icon ).

). If a separate bathroom is not available, the bathroom should be cleaned and disinfected after each use by an ill person. If this is not possible, the caregiver should wait as long as practical after use by an ill person to clean and disinfect the high-touch surfaces.

Household members should follow home care guidance when interacting with persons with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 and their isolation rooms/bathrooms.

How to clean and disinfect

Hard (Non-porous) Surfaces

Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.

If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

Always read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use. Wear skin protection and consider eye protection for potential splash hazards

Ensure adequate ventilation

Use no more than the amount recommended on the label

Use water at room temperature for dilution (unless stated otherwise on the label)

Avoid mixing chemical products

Label diluted cleaning solutions

Store and use chemicals out of the reach of children and pets You should never eat, drink, breathe or inject these products into your body or apply directly to your skin as they can cause serious harm. Do not wipe or bathe pets with these products or any other products that are not approved for animal use. See EPA’s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Useexternal icon Special considerations should be made for people with asthma and they should not be present when cleaning and disinfecting is happening as this can trigger asthma exacerbations. To learn more about reducing asthma triggers: https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/reduce_triggers.html

A list of disinfectant products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here external icon . Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Read the product label for the correct concentration to use, application method, and contact time.

Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted: Use bleach containing 5.25%–8.25% sodium hypochlorite. Do not use a bleach product if the percentage is not in this range or is not specified. Follow the manufacturer’s application instructions for the surface, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute. Ensure proper ventilation during and after application. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. This can cause fumes that may be very dangerous to breathe in.

Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: 5 tablespoons (1/3 rd cup) of 5.25–8.25% bleach per gallon of room temperature water or 4 teaspoons of 5.25–8.25% bleach per quart of room temperature water



Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.

Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.

Soft (Porous) Surfaces

For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 external icon and that are suitable for porous surfaces.



Electronics

For electronics such as cell phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, and keyboards, remove visible contamination if present. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.



Linens, clothing, and other items that go in the laundry

Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and then discard after each use. If using reusable gloves, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other household purposes. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed. If no gloves are used when handling dirty laundry, be sure to wash hands afterwards. If possible, do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air. Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s items. Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If possible, consider placing a bag liner that is either disposable (can be thrown away) or can be laundered.



Hand hygiene and other preventive measures

Household members should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.

Always read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use. Keep hand sanitizers away from fire or flame

For children under six years of age, hand sanitizer should be used with adult supervision

Always store hand sanitizer out of reach of children and pets See FDA’s Tips for Safe Sanitizer Useexternal icon and CDC’s Hand Sanitizer Use Considerations

Household members should follow normal preventive actions while at work and home including recommended hand hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Additional key times to clean hands include: After blowing one’s nose, coughing, or sneezing After using the restroom Before eating or preparing food After contact with animals or pets Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance (e.g. a child)

Treatments Your Healthcare Provider Might Recommend for Severe Illness,"The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to or spreading the virus that causes COVID-19:

Wash your hands often.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick and people who don’t live in your household.

Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others.

Cover your coughs and sneezes.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

Monitor your health daily.

Getting a flu vaccine is more important than ever this flu season to protect yourself, your family and your community from flu. A flu vaccine can also help reduce the burden on our healthcare systems responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and save medical resources for care of COVID-19 patients.

If you think you may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider.

Stay home and away from the people you live with as much as possible.

Consider getting tested.

Monitor your symptoms.

If you show an emergency warning sign , seek emergency medical care immediately. Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Emergency warning signs include:

Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face.



The FDA can issue emergency use authorizationexternal icon s (EUAs) to allow healthcare providers to use products that are not yet approved, or that are approved for other uses, to treat patients with COVID-19 if certain legal requirements are met.

Any treatments that are used for COVID-19 should be taken under the care of a healthcare provider.

People have been seriously harmed and even died after taking unapproved products to self-treat.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed and regularly updates Treatment Guidelinesexternal icon to help guide healthcare providers caring for patients with COVID-19, including when clinicians might consider using one of the products under an EUA. Currently, there are several approaches for treating patients with severe COVID-19 who are being cared for in the hospital. In studies, some drugs have shown some benefit in reducing the severity of illness or risk of death by:

Slowing the virus. Antiviral medications reduce the ability of the virus to multiply and spread through the body. Remdesivir external icon is an antiviral medication that is recommended in the current NIH Treatment Guidelines external icon for patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 and, if supplies are limited, require supplemental oxygen. Remdesivir is given to patients by infusion through their veins.



Reducing an overactive immune response. In patients with severe COVID-19, the body’s immune system may overreact to the threat of the virus. This can cause damage to the body’s organs and tissues. Some treatments can help reduce an overactive immune response that worsens the disease. Dexamethasone external icon is a steroid medication, similar to a natural hormone produced by the body. The NIH Treatment Guidelines external icon recommend dexamethasone, or a similar medication, for some hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 to prevent or reduce injury to the body. Dexamethasone is recommended for patients who need supplemental oxygen.

Treating complications. The virus that causes COVID-19 can damage the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal organs. It also can cause other complications. Depending on the complications, additional treatments might be used for severely ill hospitalized patients, such as blood thinners to prevent or treat blood clots.

Supporting the body’s immune function. Antibodies from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 (convalescent plasma) or antibodies manufactured for COVID-19 (like monoclonal antibodies) can attach to parts of the virus. This could help the immune system recognize and respond more effectively to the virus, but currently the NIH Treatment Guidelines external icon find there is not enough evidence to recommend these treatments.

find there is not enough evidence to recommend these treatments. Relieving symptoms and supporting the body’s natural defenses. Taking medications, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can reduce fever. Drinking or receiving intravenous fluids can help patients stay hydrated. Getting plenty of rest can help the body fight the virus.

Long-Term Effects of COVID-19,"CDC is actively working to learn more about the whole range of short- and long-term health effects associated with COVID-19. As the pandemic unfolds, we are learning that many organs besides the lungs are affected by COVID-19 and there are many ways the infection can affect someone’s health.

One of the health effects that CDC is closely watching and working to understand relates to COVID-19 and the heart. Heart conditions associated with COVID-19 include inflammation and damage to the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, or inflammation of the covering of the heart, known as pericarditis. These conditions can occur by themselves or in combination. Heart damage may be an important part of severe disease and death from COVID-19, especially in older people with underlying illness. Heart damage like this might also explain some frequently reported long-term symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart palpitations.

The risk of heart damage may not be limited to older and middle-aged adults. For example, young adults with COVID-19, including athletes, can also suffer from myocarditis. Severe heart damage has occurred in young, healthy people, but is rare. There may be more cases of mild effects of COVID-19 on the heart that can be diagnosed with special imaging tests, including in younger people with mild or minimal symptoms; however, the long-term significance of these mild effects on the heart are unknown. CDC will continue to assess and provide updates as new data emerge.

The listed underlying medical conditions in children were also revised to indicate that these conditions might increase risk to better reflect the quality of available data currently. This reflects the fact that there are less data available for children and does not imply that children are not at risk. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day, and as new information becomes available, CDC will update the information below. ​

Adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19:

Adults of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19:

COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, adults of any age with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19:

Want to see the evidence behind these lists?

While children have been less affected by COVID-19 compared to adults, children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and some children develop severe illness. Children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness compared to children without underlying medical conditions. Current evidence on which underlying medical conditions in children are associated with increased risk is limited. Children with the following conditions might be at increased risk for severe illness: obesity, medical complexity, severe genetic disorders, severe neurologic disorders, inherited metabolic disorders, congenital (since birth) heart disease, diabetes, asthma and other chronic lung disease, and immunosuppression due to malignancy or immune-weakening medications. We do not yet know who is at increased risk for developing the rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19 in children called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), nor do we know what causes MIS-C. Learn about MIS-C.

The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is not exhaustive and only includes conditions with sufficient evidence to draw conclusions; it is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.

Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19

It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:

Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.

Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.

If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.

Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.

As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.

Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a mask, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing masks or ask others around you to wear masks.

Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:

When to delay or cancel a visit

Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. So, think about:

How many people will you interact with?

Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?

Will you be outdoors or indoors?

What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?

Encourage social distancing during your visit

Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing.

, when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing. Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.

Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.

Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing masks or ask others around you to wear masks.

Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contact tracing if someone becomes sick.

Wear masks

Masks should be worn over the nose and mouth. Masks are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.

Masks may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others Wearing a mask helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.

Who should NOT use masks: Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Wash hands often

Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.

If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.

Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.

Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items

Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.

Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.

If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.

More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear masks, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.

Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic

Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.

It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

Talk with your healthcare provider about maintaining preventive services like cancer screenings during the pandemic.

Remember the importance of staying physically active and practicing healthy habits to cope with stress.

If you have a medical emergency, do not delay seeking emergency care.

If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan:

Continue your medicines and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.

and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Have at least a 30-day supply of prescription and non-prescription medicines.

Rural Communities,"About 46 million Americans live in rural areas, which face distinctive challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put some rural residents at increased risk of getting COVID-19 or having severe illness. In general, rural Americans tend to have higher rates of cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, and obesity as well as less access to healthcare which can negatively affect health outcomes. They are also less likely to have health insurance.

Rural communities are also becoming more diverse racially and ethnically. Racial and ethnic minority groups including, African Americans, Hispanics and Latinos, American Indians/Alaskan Natives, and Asian/Pacific Islanders, are at increased risk of getting COVID-19 and having severe illness.

Rural areas can face different health challenges depending on where they are located. Each rural community should assess their unique susceptibilitypdf iconexternal icon and social vulnerability to COVID-19. Many rural communities are considered highly vulnerable according to CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The SVI includes factors such as housing, transportation, socioeconomic status, housing, race and ethnicity, and language which can be helpful in determining how to help support rural communities before, during, and after COVID-19.

Rural communities also have strengths, assets, and protective factors that public health can use to tailor policies and messages designed to:

reduce the risk of COVID-19 community spread and improve the general health of rural populations, which may minimize the severity of COVID-19.

How Rural Communities Can Respond During COVID-19

Approaches for public health professionals

Approaches for rural healthcare systems and healthcare providers

Planning

Patient Care

Approaches for community-based organizations and interest groups

Review COVID-19 information, considerations for community-based organizations, and communication resources from federal, state, and local governments.

Inform your community that COVID-19 cases can occur, even with careful planning and preparation. Some people can spread the disease before they start having symptoms, or even if they never have symptoms.

Educate the community about COVID-19 prevention behaviors and use of masks.

Provide information on hygiene practices and limiting travel.

Plan and communicate about consistent mitigation activities, given there is no treatment, vaccine, or other pharmaceutical intervention for COVID-19.

Engage community members in education campaigns and mitigation efforts. Residents, local business, and media may have creative ideas on ways to protect their community. Find innovative ideas on the Rural Health Information Hub (RHIhub external icon ).

Be aware of possible stigma related to testing and having COVID-19.

Work with local healthcare providers and organizations to develop a Community Health Work (CHW) program external icon if the community does not already have one.

if the community does not already have one. Make every attempt to continue services for rural homeless populations in the event of community spread of COVID-19. See CDC’s resources for supporting people experiencing homelessness

See CDC communication resources.

Approaches for rural residents

The best way to prevent becoming sick is to avoid being exposed to the virus. This means staying home whenever possible and avoiding public places where you may encounter many other people. If you are near other people, try to keep 6 feet apart (about two arm lengths).

Use masks and other COVID-19 prevention behaviors to limit exposure to the virus.

Know how to contact a healthcare provider if you or a family member becomes ill.

Keep preventive care and other routine healthcare appointments, such as vaccinations and blood pressure checks, when possible. Check with your provider about safety precautions for office visits.

Volunteer by contacting community service organizations and ask how you can help. Make and distribute masks for others in the community. Help older adults, people with disabilities, and others at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness, in your family or in the community, by shopping for groceries or running errands.

Create an information card with the phone numbers and addresses of healthcare facilities, along with the family and friends who live nearest to you. Locate state, local, or tribal health centers in advance to learn where to get tested for COVID-19, along with other COVID-19 health information.

Create a phone tree system with family, friends, and neighbors that will be helpful to share information and get messages out quickly if COVID-19 affects your community.

Know medicines your family members may need and see if you can have extra on hand to reduce visits to the pharmacist while COVID-19 is circulating in the community. Many health insurance plans now allow for early access to prescriptions, for more than a 90-day supply of medication.

Find ways that you and your family can cope with stress.

Approaches for businesses and workplaces

Consult with your local health department to get updated information about COVID-19 cases in the area.

Review CDC’s resources for businesses.

Talk to employees about their concerns, and share resources to keep employees and their families safe and help them cope with stress.

Use strategies that help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, and help protect all employees, including those at higher risk. These strategies include: Consider telework arrangements, if possible, along with other social distancing practices (staying at least 6 feet away from other people. This might mean making changes to the physical environment such as adding physical barriers (dividers). Encourage employees to stay home when sick using paid or non-punitive sick leave. Promote handwashing. Provide supplies for cleaning and disinfecting workspaces and appropriate personal protective equipment.



Additional considerations

People in rural areas are often in close proximity to animals, whether livestock, pets, or wildlife. Interactions between people and animals may occur during farming, working with animals, interacting with pets, visiting fairs or animal exhibitions, or coming into contact with wildlife while hunting, hiking, or during other outdoor activities, as well as when wildlife wander near homes. We are still learning about the virus that causes COVID-19, but it appears that it can spread from people to certain types of animals, including pets, in some situations. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.

Why Rural Communities May Be at Higher Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic

The health of populations in rural America

Rural Americans may be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 because they:

Are older external icon than non-rural populations.

than non-rural populations. Have higher rates of underlying chronic disease even after adjusting for age.

Are more likely to have a disability: Up to one-third of adults living in rural areas report having a disability, which is 9% higher than those living in more urban areas. Up to 1 in 12 adults living in rural counties report having three or more disabilities, which is 24% higher than those living in more urban areas. In the United States, adults with disabilities are 3 times as likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer as those without disabilities.



Healthcare infrastructure

Rural healthcare infrastructure is limited. Since 2005, 170 hospitals have closedexternal icon and 700 more are currently at risk of closure. Many rural hospitals have a limited number of hospital beds, ICU beds, or ventilators, which can affect their ability to treat patients with COVID-19. Rural residents seeking care must often travel long distances to reach hospitals, health care facilities, and clinical specialists.

Additional infrastructure issues affecting a rural community’s ability to respond to COVID-19 include:

Emergency medical services (EMS) often use volunteers who must travel long distances to respond to a call.

Shortage of health professionals for primary care is common in many rural areas.

Public health departments serving rural areas often serve large geographic regions, which include non-rural populations, further straining limited resources.

Widespread use of telemedicine is not possible in some areas because of absent or unreliable broadband and internet communications.

Agricultural and food processing industries

Meat, poultry, and food processing industries are largely located in rural areas. Occupations in these industries often involve working closer than the recommended 6-foot distance, which puts workers at increased risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. Not only are workers at risk because of the conditions in these industries, but the industries are considered critical and less likely to close, leaving workers little choice but to come to work even when other businesses are shut because of high community transmission. COVID-19 outbreaks among meat and poultry processing facility workers can rapidly affect large numbers of workers and extend into the communities where they live. Targeted workplace interventions and prevention efforts that are tailored to the groups most affected by COVID-19 are critical to reducing the risk of getting COVID-19 at work.

People with Disabilities,"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.

Disability alone may not be related to higher risk for getting COVID-19 or having severe illness. Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19. However, some people with disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection or severe illness because of their underlying medical conditions. All people seem to be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 if they have serious underlying chronic medical conditions like chronic lung disease, a serious heart condition, or a weakened immune system. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely than adults without disabilities to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities.

You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

Disability groups and risk

If you have one of the disability types listed below, you might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness. You should discuss your risk of illness with your healthcare provider.

People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members

People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing

People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness

Protect yourself

If you or someone you care for are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, take steps to prevent getting sick. In addition to practicing everyday preventive actions, people with disabilities who have direct support providers can help protect themselves from respiratory illness in the following ways:

Ask your direct support provider if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 or if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19

Tell your direct service provider to Wash their hands when they enter your home and before and after touching you (e.g., dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, toileting, feeding), handling tissues, or when changing linens or doing laundry. Learn more about proper handwashing. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (e.g., counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, bedside tables), and equipment such as wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, canes, oxygen tanks and tubing, communication boards and other assistive devices. Refer to CDC’s General Recommendations for Routine Cleaning and Disinfections of Households.



Prepare

There are some additional things people with disabilities can do to prepare during the COVID-19 outbreak:

Plan what you will do if you or your direct support provider gets sick. Create a contact list of family, friends, neighbors and local service agencies that can provide support in case you or your direct support provider becomes ill or unavailable.

Plan at least two ways of communicating from home and work that can be used rapidly in an emergency (e.g., landline phone, cell phone, text-messaging, email). Write down this information and keep it with you.

Have enough household items and groceries so that you will be comfortable staying home for a few weeks, at least a 30-day supply of over the counter and prescription medicines and any medical equipment or supplies that you might need. Some health plans allow for a 90-day refill on prescription medications. Consider discussing this option with your healthcare provider. Make a photocopy of prescriptions, as this may help in obtaining medications in an emergency situation.

About COVID-19

Coronavirus disease is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is also possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. For more information go to CDC’s Fact Sheet- What you need to know about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pdf icon .

. Risk of infection with COVID-19 is higher for people who are in close contact with someone known to have COVID-19, such as healthcare workers, direct support providers, and household members. Other people at higher risk for infection are those who live or have recently been in an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19.

Prevention and treatment

There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to take everyday preventive actions, like avoiding close contact with people who are sick and washing your hands often.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 can seek medical care to help relieve symptoms.",2/11/20 0:00,
People with Developmental and Behavioral Disorders,"Developmental and behavioral disorders are a group of conditions due to an impairment in physical, learning, language, or behavior areas.

What do people with developmental and behavioral disorders need to know about COVID-19?

Know who is at risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Most people with developmental or behavioral disorders are not naturally at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from novel coronavirus (COVID-19). However, people with developmental or behavioral disorders who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at risk of serious illness. Some people with developmental or behavioral disorders may have difficulties accessing information, understanding or practicing preventative measures, and communicating symptoms of illness.

Know how to protect yourself and others

There is currently no specific, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for COVID-19, and there is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. Treatment is currently supportive. Therefore, the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Advice on preparation for COVID-19 and prevention of exposure to COVID-19 is available.

Continue with your routine care

Don’t stop any medications or change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.

Discuss any concerns about your treatment with your healthcare provider.

Ensure that you are obtaining the tests ordered by your healthcare provider.

Continue to get your routine immunizations.

Talk to your healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about creating an emergency supply of prescription medications. Make sure that you have at least 30 days of prescription and over-the-counter medications and supplies on hand in case you need to stay home for a long time. Ask your healthcare provider if it is possible to obtain a 90-day supply of your prescription medications.

Make or update care plans or an emergency notebook. They typically include important information about a person’s medical conditions, how to manage those conditions, how to contact healthcare providers and therapists, allergies, information on medications (names, dosages, and administration instructions), preferences (food and other), and daily routines and activities. This may help you receive consistent care if your Direct Service Providers or family members are unavailable.

Know how to manage stress and cope during the pandemic

It is natural to feel concerned or stressed as more cases of COVID-19 are discovered and our communities take action to slow the spread of disease. Taking care of yourself, your friends, and your family can help you cope with stress.

"If You Are Pregnant, Breastfeeding, or Caring for Young Children","COVID-19 and pregnancy

Based on what we know at this time, pregnant people might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 may be at increased risk for other adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth.

Take steps to protect yourself from COVID-19

There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible. In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

Here are preventive steps you and people you live with can take:

Limit close contact interactions with other people as much as possible.

When going out or interacting with others outside your immediate household, Wear a mask, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Note that wearing a mask is not a substitute for other everyday prevention actions like washing hands frequently and avoiding close contact with other people. Avoid others who are not wearing masks or ask others around you to wear a mask, if possible. Stay at least 6 feet away from others outside your household. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid activities where taking protective measures may be difficult and where social distancing can’t be maintained.

Visit your healthcare provider for all recommended appointments. If you need help finding one, contact your nearest hospital clinic, community health center external icon , or health department.

, or health department. Talk to your healthcare provider about How to stay healthy and take care of yourself and your baby. Any questions you have about the best place to deliver your baby. Delivering your baby is always safest under the care of trained healthcare professionals.



If you’re concerned about going to your appointments because of COVID-19, ask your healthcare provider what steps they’re taking to separate healthy patients from those who may be sick.

Some healthcare providers may choose to cancel or postpone some visits.

Others may switch certain appointments to telemedicine visits, which are appointments over the phone or video.

These decisions may be based on the situation in your community as well as your individual health risks.

Get recommended vaccines and a 30-day supply of your medicines.

Getting the recommended vaccines during pregnancy can help protect you and your baby.

Get vaccinated against influenza (or flu). Flu and COVID-19 are both respiratory illnesses that can spread from person to person. They can affect breathing and have similar symptoms, but they are caused by different viruses (read more about similarities and differences between flu and COVID-19). It is unknown how these two viruses may interact during the upcoming flu season. There is no vaccine available to protect against the virus that causes COVID-19. You should protect yourself against flu by getting vaccinated. Others living in your household should also get vaccinated to protect themselves and you.

Get the whooping cough (Tdap) vaccine during pregnancy to protect your baby against whooping cough, which can also present with similar symptoms to COVID-19.

Ask your doctor and pharmacy to give you at least a 30-day supply of the medicines you need.

Call your healthcare provider if you have any health concerns.

These concerns may include:

You think you have COVID-19 (call within 24 hours).

You think you are experiencing depression during or after pregnancy.

You have any questions related to your health.

Don’t delay getting emergency care because of COVID-19.

Call 911 or go to your local emergency department.

If you are going to the emergency department, call and tell them that you are pregnant and are having an emergency. They should have a plan to protect you from getting COVID-19.

If someone else is driving, call while you’re on the way. If you need to drive yourself to the emergency department, call before you start driving.​

Caring for newborns when the mother has COVID-19

Much is still unknown about the risks of COVID-19 to newborns born to mothers with COVID-19. We do know that:

Infections causing COVID-19 in newborns born to mothers with COVID-19 are uncommon.

Some newborns have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 shortly after birth. It is unknown if these newborns got the virus before, during, or after birth from close contact with an infected person.

Most newborns who tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 had mild or no symptoms and recovered. However, there are a few reports of newborns with severe COVID-19 illness.

Preterm (less than 37 completed weeks gestation) birth and other problems with pregnancy and birth have been reported among women who tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy. It is unknown whether these problems were related to the virus that causes COVID-19.

Decide if your newborn is rooming-in with you in the hospital.

CDC recognizes that the ideal setting for the care of a healthy, full-term newborn during the birth hospitalization is within the mother’s room (“rooming-in”). Current evidence suggests that the risk of a newborn getting COVID-19 from its mother is low, especially when she uses appropriate precautions before and during care of the newborn, such as wearing a mask and practicing hand hygiene.

If you are diagnosed with or test positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, you should discuss with your healthcare provider the risks and benefits of having your newborn stay in the same room with you. This conversation should begin during prenatal care if possible. Having your newborn stay with you in the same room has the benefit of facilitating breastfeeding and maternal-newborn bonding. Potential risks may include giving the virus to the newborn, although current evidence suggests the risk of a newborn getting COVID-19 from their mother is low if precautions are taken. After discussing, make an informed decision of whether your newborn is staying in the same room with you while in the hospital.

Take precautions when having your newborn stay in the same room with you, if you are in isolation for COVID-19.

If you are in isolation for COVID-19 and are sharing a room with your newborn, take the following precautions to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to your newborn:

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before holding or caring for your newborn. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Wear a mask when within 6 feet of your newborn.

Keep your newborn more than 6 feet away from you as much as possible.

Discuss with your healthcare provider about using a physical barrier (for example, placing the newborn in an incubator) while in the hospital.

If your isolation period has ended, you should still wash your hands before caring for your newborn, but you don’t need to take the other precautions. You most likely won’t pass the virus to your newborn or any other close contacts after your isolation period has ended.

If you had symptoms, your isolation period ends after 10 days since symptoms first appeared, and 24 hours with no fever without fever-reducing medications, and Other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving

If you never had symptoms, your isolation period ends after 10 days since the date of your positive COVID-19 test



Take precautions at home if you are in isolation for COVID-19.

If you are still in isolation for COVID-19 and have returned home, take the following precautions until your isolation period has ended:

Stay home to separate yourself from others outside your home.

Consider isolating from other household members within your home who are not infected.

Have a healthy caregiver who is not at increased risk for severe illness provide care for your newborn. Caregivers should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds before touching your newborn. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. If the caregiver is living in the same home or has been in close contact with you, they should wear a mask when they are within 6 feet of your newborn for the entire time you are in isolation and for two weeks after you completed isolation.

If a healthy caregiver is not available, you can care for your newborn if you are well enough. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before touching for your newborn. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Wear a mask when within 6 feet of your newborn and other people during your entire isolation period. The mask helps prevent you from spreading the virus to others.



Others in your household and caregivers who have COVID-19 should isolate and avoid caring for the newborn as much as possible. If they have to care for the newborn, they should practice hand hygiene and wear a mask.

Do not put a face shield or mask on your baby.

A face shield could increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or accidental suffocation and strangulation. Babies move frequently. Their movement may cause the plastic face shield to block their nose and mouth, or cause the strap to strangle them.

There are also no data supporting the use of face shields among babies for protection against COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses.

CDC recommends all people 2 years of age and older wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household. CDC does not recommend use of face shields as a substitute for masks for the general public, including pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.

Ensure safe sleep for your baby.

Safe sleep is an important part of keeping babies healthy.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents of babies may experience increased stress and fatigue that could affect their ability to ensure that their baby is sleeping safely. Help reduce your baby’s risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and other sleep-related deaths by doing the following:

Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times – naps and at night.

Use a firm, flat sleep surface, such as a mattress in a crib covered by a fitted sheet.

Have the baby share your room but not your bed. Your baby shouldn’t sleep on an adult bed, cot, air mattress, couch, or chair, whether he or she is sleeping alone, with you, or with anyone else.

Keep soft bedding, such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys, out of your baby’s sleep area.

Do not cover your baby’s head or allow your baby to get too hot. Signs your baby may be getting too hot include sweating or his or her chest feeling hot.

Don’t smoke or allow anyone to smoke around your baby.

Learn more about how to reduce the risk of SIDS.

Bring your baby for newborn visits.

Ideally, newborn visits are done in person so that your baby’s healthcare provider can

Check how you and your baby are doing overall.

Check your baby’s growth and feeding.

Check your baby for jaundice.

Make sure your baby’s newborn screening tests were done (including a bloodspot, hearing test, and a test for critical congenital heart defects) and do any repeat or follow-up testing, if necessary.

Make sure to call and notify your baby’s healthcare provider before visiting if you or your baby have COVID-19.

COVID-19 and breastfeeding

Current evidence suggests that breast milk isn’t likely to spread the virus to babies.

You, along with your family and healthcare providers, should decide whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding. Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most babies. We don’t know for sure if mothers with COVID-19 can spread the virus to babies in breast milk, but the current evidence suggests that this isn’t likely.

Helpful tips for breastfeeding

You may find it harder to start or continue breastfeeding if you are not sharing a room with your newborn in the hospital. Here are some helpful tips:

Frequent hand expression or pumping, ideally with a hospital-grade pump, will help you establish and build milk supply if you are separated from your newborn.

Pump or feed every 2-3 hours (at least 8-10 times in 24 hours, including at night), especially in the first few days. This signals the breasts to produce milk and prevents blocked milk ducts and breast infections.

If you are unable to establish milk production in the hospital after birth, or have to temporarily stop breastfeeding during your COVID-19 illness because you do not feel well enough, get help from a lactation support provider. Learn more about relactation.

You should always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds before breastfeeding or expressing breast milk even if you don’t have COVID-19. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19

People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. COVID-19 can affect your nose, throat, lungs (respiratory tract); cause an asthma attack; and possibly lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease.

Treatment

There is currently no preventive treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19.

Prepare for COVID-19

box tissue light icon Protect Your Health This Flu Season People at High Risk For Flu Complications Getting a flu vaccine during 2020-2021 is more important than ever because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk from flu; many of whom are also at high risk for COVID-19 or serious outcomes.

Follow your Asthma Action Plan

Any disinfectant can trigger an asthma attack.

Follow the recommendations below to reduce your chance of an asthma attack while disinfecting to prevent COVID-19.

If you have asthma, Ask an adult without asthma to clean and disinfect surfaces and objects for you. Stay in another room when cleaners or disinfectants are being used and right after their use. Use only cleaning products you must use. Some surfaces and objects that are seldom touched may need to be cleaned only with soap and water. Make a list of the urgent care or health facilities near you that provide nebulizer/asthma treatments. Keep it close to your phone If you have an asthma attack, move away from the trigger such as the disinfectant or the area that was disinfected. Follow your Asthma Action Plan. Call 911 for medical emergencies.

The person cleaning and disinfecting should: Follow recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting to prevent COVID-19. Choose disinfectants that are less likely to cause an asthma attack, using EPA’s list of approved products external icon such as: products with hydrogen peroxide (no stronger than 3%) or ethanol (ethyl alcohol) products that do NOT contain peroxyacetic acid or peracetic acid. Limit use of chemicals that can trigger asthma attacks, such as bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g. benzalkonium chloride), and do not use them in enclosed spaces. Follow additional precautions for cleaning and disinfecting places where people with asthma may be, to reduce exposure to asthma triggers.

Use products safely and correctly: Always read and follow the directions on the product label to ensure you are using it safely and effectively. Wear skin protection such as gloves and consider eye protection to protect yourself against splashes. Make sure there is enough air flow (ventilation). Use only the amount recommended on the label. Use water at room temperature for dilution (unless stated otherwise on the label). Do NOT mix chemical products. Label diluted cleaning solutions.

Store products safely and correctly Store and use chemicals out of the reach of children and pets. Label diluted cleaning solutions. Follow EPA’s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Use external icon .

Protect Yourself When Using Transportation,"As schools, businesses, and community organizations provide services during the pandemic, consider ways that you can protect yourself and slow the spread of COVID-19 when using transportation. When you consider the following options, think about what is feasible, practical, and acceptable to you and meets your needs. See CDC’s tips for how to stay safe while running errands.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

This page includes information on using transportation in your local community to accomplish everyday activities. Find information about traveling outside of your local community (air travel, RV travel, etc.) here.",2/11/20 0:00,
Wear Face Masks on Public Transportation Conveyances and at Transportation Hubs,"Traveling on public transportation conveyances increases a person’s risk of getting and spreading COVID-19 by bringing persons in close contact with others, often for prolonged periods, and exposing them to frequently touched surfaces. Air travel often requires spending time in security lines and busy airport terminals. Travel by bus, train, and other conveyances used for international, interstate, or intrastate transportation poses similar challenges. Social distancing is often difficult on public transportation. People may not be able to distance themselves by the recommended at least 6 feet from individuals seated nearby or those standing in or passing through the aisles on airplanes, trains, or buses.

Transmission of the virus through travelers has led to—and continues to lead to—interstate and international spread of the virus which causes COVID-19. Appropriately worn masks reduce the spread of COVID-19—particularly given the evidence of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of the virus.

CDC strongly recommends appropriate masks be worn by all passengers and by all personnel operating the conveyance while on public transportation conveyances (e.g., airplanes, ships, ferries, trains, subways, buses, taxis, ride-shares) and at transportation hubs and other locations where people board such conveyances (e.g. airports, bus or ferry terminals, train stations, seaports).

People should wear masks that cover both the mouth and nose when waiting for, traveling on, or departing from public conveyances. People should also wear masks at an airport, bus or ferry terminal, train or subway station, seaport, or similar area that provides transportation.

People should wear masks when traveling into, within, or out of the United States on public conveyances.

Conveyance operators transporting people should refuse to board anyone not wearing a mask and require all people onboard, whether passengers or employees, to wear masks for the duration of travel except in the following circumstances: for brief periods while eating, drinking, or taking medication; if unconscious, incapacitated, unable to be awakened, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance; and when necessary to temporarily remove the mask to verify one’s identity such as during Transportation Security Administration screening or when asked to do so by the ticket or gate agent or any law enforcement official for children under the age of 2 years old



Public transportation conveyance operators should ensure that any person on the conveyance wears a mask when boarding, disembarking, and for the duration of travel. Depending on the circumstances, conveyances operators should take the following actions:

provide information to people purchasing tickets or otherwise booking transportation (in advance or on the day of departure) about the need to wear a mask on the conveyance and that failure to comply will result in denial of boarding. Operators should provide this information again at the time of boarding;

board only those people who wear appropriate masks;

monitor the conveyance for any person who does not wear a mask and seek compliance from such person; and

at the earliest opportunity, disembark any person who refuses to comply

if possible, have masks available for those passengers who do not have a mask

Mask use may be exempted for the following categories of people:

a child under the age of 2 (masks should NOT be worn by children under the age of 2);

a person with written instructions from a licensed medical provider to not wear a mask;

a person with a disability, mental health condition, or sensory sensitivity that prevents that person from wearing a mask;

a person who is hearing impaired, or communicating with someone who is hearing impaired, when the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication;

a person for whom wearing a mask would create a risk to workplace health, safety, or job duty as determined by the relevant workplace safety guidelines or federal regulations; or

a person operating or essential to operating a conveyance for whom wearing a mask would interfere with that person’s ability to safely operate the conveyance.

Many countries, states, territories, tribes, and local authorities have implemented mask requirements within their jurisdictional boundaries, including on public conveyances and associated boarding terminals, to protect public health and reduce the spread of COVID-19 within and between communities. Transportation partners, including airlines, train and bus operators, and taxi and ride-share companies, have also issued mask requirements on their conveyances.

Broad and routine utilization of masks on our transportation systems will protect Americans and provide confidence that we can once again travel safely even during this pandemic. Therefore, CDC is providing this guidance to further support state and local health authorities, transportation partners, and conveyance operators who have implemented requirements for masks to support passenger and crew safety, maintain safe and operational transportation systems, mitigate further introduction and spread of COVID-19, and help safely re-open America’s economy.",2/11/20 0:00,
Know When to Delay your Travel to Avoid Spreading COVID-19,"When to Delay your Travel

The COVID-19 pandemic may be stressful for people. Traveling with family or friends can be a stress reliever, but it also increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. You don’t want to miss out on a planned trip, but there are situations when cancelling or postponing travel makes sense for you and those you care about. Delaying your trip when you could spread COVID-19 also protects other travelers, people who work in travel settings, and those at your destination.

Check these common scenarios to see if you or your travel companions should delay your travel. This list does not include all possible situations. Talk to your health care provider before you travel if you are unsure whether any of these situations apply to you or your travel companions.

You and your travel companions (including children) pose a risk to your family, friends, and community for 14 days after you were exposed to the virus. Regardless of where you traveled or what you did during your trip, take these actions to protect others from getting sick:

When around others, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people who are not from your household. It is important to do this everywhere, both indoors and outdoors.

Wear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when you are outside of your home, and including when using public transportation.

Help Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in Children,"Wash hands

Make sure your child washes their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Read more and watch a video on how to wash hands correctly.

If soap and water are not readily available, make sure your child uses a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Teach your child to cover all surfaces of their hands with hand sanitizer and rub their hands together until they feel dry. If your child is under 6 years of age, supervise them when they use hand sanitizer.

You, as a parent, guardian, or caretaker, play an important role in teaching your child to wash their hands.

Explain that handwashing can keep them healthy and stop germs from spreading to others.

Be a good role model — if you wash your hands as recommended, they’re more likely to do the same.

Make handwashing a family activity.

Practice cough and sneeze etiquette by covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing, throwing the tissue in the closest garbage can, and washing your hands after you throw it away.

Avoid close contact

Keep your child at least 6 feet away from others who don’t live with them and those who are sick (such as coughing and sneezing).

Limit in-person playtime and connect virtually with other children

CDC recognizes this pandemic has been stressful to many. Socializing and interacting with peers can be a healthy way for children to cope with stress and connect with others. However, the key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit close contact with others as much as possible.

An important guiding principle to remember is that the more people your child interacts with, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. While your child may be spending time with other people as they return to childcare or school settings, you should limit your child’s interactions with additional children and adults outside of childcare or school to decrease risk.

For playdates, the risk of COVID-19 increases as follows:

Lowest risk: No in-person playdates. Children connect virtually (via phone calls and video chats).

No in-person playdates. Children connect virtually (via phone calls and video chats). Medium risk: Infrequent playdates with the same family or friend who is also practicing everyday preventive measures. Children maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other during the playdate. ​Playdates are held outdoors. (Indoor spaces are more risky than outdoor space where there is less ventilation and it might be harder to keep children apart.)

Infrequent playdates with the same family or friend who is also practicing everyday preventive measures. Children maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other during the playdate. ​Playdates are held outdoors. (Indoor spaces are more risky than outdoor space where there is less ventilation and it might be harder to keep children apart.) Highest Risk: Frequent indoor playdates with multiple friends or families who are not practicing everyday preventive measures. Children do not maintain a distance of 6 feet from each other.

To help your child maintain social connections while social distancing, help them have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends.

Limit your child’s interaction with people at highest risk of severe illness from COVID-19

To protect those who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, you may consider taking these extra precautions.

Separate your child from others in your household who have an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Carefully consider who might be best to provide childcare if you are unable to care for your child (for example, you are not able to stay with your child while childcare or school is closed).

Limit your child’s contact with other people if someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (such as an older adult or someone with an underlying medical condition).

Postpone visits or trips to see grandparents, older family members and family members who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Consider connecting virtually or by writing letters.

Wear a mask

Children 2 years of age and older should wear a mask.

Help your child (if 2 years of age or older) wear a mask correctly when in public and when around people they don’t live with.

CDC recognizes that wearing masks may not be possible in every situation or for some people. Correct and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some children, such as children with certain disabilities, including cognitive, intellectual, developmental, sensory and behavioral disorders. Learn more about what you can do if your child or you cannot wear masks in certain situations.

Note that wearing a mask is not a substitute for other everyday prevention actions, like avoiding close contact with others and washing hands frequently.

Clean & disinfect

Consider changing travel plans

Because travel increases your child’s chances of coming in contact with others who may have COVID-19 and your child spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to others if they are infected, staying home is the best way to protect your child and others from getting sick.

We don’t know if one type of travel is safer than others. Any place where travelers interact with other people (for example, airports, bus stations, train stations, gas stations, restaurants, and rest stops) are places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces.

Cover coughs and sneezes

When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, throw your tissue in closest garbage can, and wash your hands. Encourage your child and all household members to do the same.

Bring your child for their healthcare visits

Routine well-child visits and vaccine visits are essential, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prepare for your child’s healthcare visits

Call your child’s healthcare provider to ask about any upcoming appointments or to ask when your child’s vaccinations are due.

Ask your child’s healthcare provider what steps they are taking to separate healthy patients from those who may be sick. Some healthcare providers may choose to delay in-person visits, which will be based on the situation in your community and your child’s individual care plan.

Notify your child’s healthcare provider before your visit if you or your child have any symptoms of COVID-19.

Bring your child for well-child visits and vaccine visits

Your child’s healthcare provider will check your child’s growth and development at well-child visits. You can also track your child’s developmental milestones with CDC’s free Milestone Tracker app.

Vaccines are an important part of keeping your child healthy by protecting them against vaccine-preventable diseases. There are effective vaccines for illnesses such as measles, flu (influenza), whooping cough (pertussis), and other diseases that can spread from person to person. Although there is not yet a vaccine to help protect against COVID-19, your child should receive all of their recommended vaccines.

Get a flu vaccine by the end of October

A flu vaccine is the single best way to prevent flu.

CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older get a flu vaccine each year by the end of October (with rare exceptions). You and your child can get a flu vaccine during healthcare visits, or you can find additional locations at vaccinefinder.orgexternal icon.

Getting a flu vaccine can reduce the likelihood of your child getting sick, being hospitalized, or dying from flu. You and your family getting a flu vaccine will also help protect others around you who may be more vulnerable to severe illness from flu, like babies and young children, older adults, pregnant people, and those with certain medical conditions.

It is especially important for this upcoming flu season to help prevent over-burdening the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Get immediate help in a crisis and find a health care provider or treatment for substance use disorder and mental health.

Children and young people can be particularly overwhelmed by stress related to a traumatic event, like the COVID-19 pandemic. They may show stress through increased anxiety, fear, sadness or worry. When children and young people are struggling to cope with stress, they may exhibit unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, changes in activity level, substance use or other risk behaviors, and difficulty with attention and concentration.

Parents, caregivers, and other trusted adults can serve as sources of social connectedness; they can provide stability, support, and open communication. They can also help children and young people express the many different feelings and thoughts on their mind.

Here are some quick ideas for how to get conversations started with children and young people about how they are feeling and what they are struggling with regarding COVID-19. You don’t have to use these exact words—you know best how to speak with your child, adolescent or youth. In addition, how we talk to children and young people varies depending on their age and developmental level.

COVID-19 is a new disease, which can be confusing. Do you have any questions about it? If I don’t know the answer, I can try to find it or maybe we could search for it together.

People can be angry, sad, or worried when something bad happens. Those feelings can make you feel confused or uncomfortable. Tell me what you have been feeling since the changes started.

What worries you most about COVID-19?

Have you been feeling nervous about going back to school because of COVID-19?

Wearing masks and staying at a distance from others is not something we were used to doing. How do you feel about that?

When our minds are stuck on bad things, it can be really hard to focus on other things. Have you ever felt this way? What kinds of things does your mind get stuck on?

Is there anything that you are looking forward to, for when we can connect in-person more safely and return to more normal activities—like a vacation, movie, graduation or playing on a sports team? Tell me about what that might look like!

Scavenger hunts can be a fun activity for children, adolescents and adults. Consider the age of the participants, where you are playing, and the type of items you will be looking for. This At-Home Scavenger Hunt is recommended for children ages 6 years and older, adolescents, and adults within the same household. You may decide to play as individual players or teams. You can assist younger children in safely searching for items.

Where to play?

This activity is designed to be played indoors, at home. Prior to starting, you should decide where in the home you want to play—all around the home or only in specific rooms or areas.

Safety first!

Follow everyday safety precautions when searching for items around the house. Watch your step. Use handrails when going up or down the stairs. Do not climb over objects. No matter the number of players and their ages – safety first! If anyone who does not live in the same household is playing, be sure all players keep their distance (6 ft apart) and wear a mask.

Keep in mind, not all items are worth the same amount of points… it can be anybody’s game until the very end! Discussion questions per item are also included to promote conversation among players about staying physically, socially, emotionally and mentally healthy during COVID-19.

How to play?

Decide if you are playing individually or as teams. If teams, assign players to each team. Specify the areas of the home in which you are playing. Assign a facilitator to lead the scavenger hunt. The facilitator will open, download or print the materials for the game. The list of items to be searched for, and discussion questions are found on the scoring sheet.

Children and COVID-19

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can affect children, adolescents and young adults directly and indirectly. Beyond getting sick, their social, emotional, and mental wellbeing has been impacted by the pandemic. Trauma faced at each developmental stage can continue to affect individuals across their lifespan.

Mental Health and Coping During COVID-19,"Know the facts to help reduce stress

Knowing the facts about COVID-19 and stopping the spread of rumors can help reduce stress and stigma. Understanding the risk to yourself and people you care about can help you connect with others and make an outbreak less stressful.

Take care of your mental health

Mental health is an important part of overall health and wellbeing. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It may also affect how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices during an emergency.

People with pre-existing mental health conditions or substance use disorders may be particularly vulnerable in an emergency. Mental health conditions (such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia) affect a person’s thinking, feeling, mood or behavior in a way that influences their ability to relate to others and function each day. These conditions may be situational (short-term) or long-lasting (chronic). People with preexisting mental health conditions should continue with their treatment and be aware of new or worsening symptoms. If you think you have new or worse symptoms, call your healthcare provider.

Call your healthcare provider if stress gets in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row. Free and confidential resources can also help you or a loved one connect with a skilled, trained counselor in your area.

Suicide

Different life experiences affect a person’s risk for suicide. For example, suicide risk is higher among people who have experienced violence, including child abuse, bullying, or sexual violence. Feelings of isolation, depression, anxiety, and other emotional or financial stresses are known to raise the risk for suicide. People may be more likely to experience these feelings during a crisis like a pandemic.

However, there are ways to protect against suicidal thoughts and behaviors. For example, support from family and community, or feeling connected, and having access to in-person or virtual counseling or therapy can help with suicidal thoughts and behavior, particularly during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Learn more about CDC’s work in suicide prevention.

Recovering from COVID-19 or ending home isolation

It can be stressful to be separated from others if you have or were exposed to COVID-19. Each person ending a period of home isolation may feel differently about it.

Emotional reactions may include:

Mixed emotions, including relief.

Fear and worry about your own health and the health of your loved ones.

Stress from the experience of having COVID-19 and monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others.

Sadness, anger, or frustration because friends or loved ones have fears of getting the disease from you, even though you are cleared to be around others.

Guilt about not being able to perform normal work or parenting duties while you had COVID-19.

Worry about getting re-infected or sick again even though you’ve already had COVID-19.

Other emotional or mental health changes.

Children may also feel upset or have other strong emotions if they, or someone they know, has COVID-19, even if they are now better and able to be around others again.",2/11/20 0:00,
Reducing Stigma,"Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

No single person or group of people are more likely than others to spread COVID-19. Public health emergencies, such as this pandemic, are stressful times for people and communities. Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to social stigma, which is negative attitudes and beliefs toward people, places, or things. Stigma can lead to labeling, stereotyping, discriminationexternal icon, and other negative behaviors toward others. For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people link a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population, community, or nationality. Stigma can also happen after a person has recovered from COVID-19 or been released from home isolation or quarantine.

Some groups of people who may experience stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic include:

Certain racial and ethnic minority groups, including Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and black or African Americans;

People who tested positive for COVID-19, have recovered from being sick with COVID-19, or were released from COVID-19 quarantine;

Emergency responders or healthcare providers;

Other frontline workers, such as grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, or farm and food processing plant workers;

People who have disabilities or developmental or behavioral disorders who may have difficulty following recommendations;

People who have underlying health conditions that cause a cough;

People living in congregate (group) settings, such as people experiencing homelessness.

Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem. Stigma can also make people more likely to hide symptoms or illness, keep them from seeking health care immediately, and prevent individuals from adopting healthy behaviors. This means that stigma can make it more difficult to control the spread of an outbreak.

Groups who experience stigma may also experience discrimination. This discrimination can take the form of:

Other people avoiding or rejecting them;

Getting denied healthcare, education, housing, or employment;

Verbal abuse; or

Physical violence.

Stigma can negatively affect the emotional, mental, and physical health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stigmatized individuals may experience isolation, depression, anxiety, or public embarrassment. Stopping stigma is important to making all communities and community members safer and healthier. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in their communities.

Call the National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Referral Routing Service (1-800-662-HELP) to speak with someone about an alcohol or substance use problem.

What you can do

Consider healthier options for stress and coping such as exercise, meditation, or reaching out to friends and family.

What states and communities can do

Support evidence-based prevention of excessive drinking. Greater availability and accessibility of alcohol is linked with excessive alcohol drinking. Many states and communities are providing additional options for delivery and takeaway of alcoholic beverages. The Community Preventive Services Task Forceexternal icon recommends limiting the availability of alcohol to lower excessive alcohol use and its impacts. It also recommends enforcing laws that prohibit sales to minors, which may be difficult with home delivery of alcohol.

What healthcare providers can do

Screen all adult patients for excessive drinking.

Advise patients who screen positive for drinking too much to drink less (and refer people who might have an alcohol use disorder to specialized treatment).

Screen all adults for substance use and refer people who might have a substance use disorder to specialized treatment.

Basics of excessive alcohol use

Drinking too much can be harmful to your health. Most people who drink excessively are not alcoholics or alcohol dependent. Excessive alcohol use includes binge drinking, which is defined as five or more drinks on an occasion (within two or three hours) for men, and four or more drinks on an occasion (within two or three hours) for women. Other forms of excessive alcohol use include heavy drinking (15 or more drinks a week for men, eight or more drinks a week for women), and any drinking by pregnant people or people younger than 21 years. Excessive alcohol use leads to more than 95,000 deaths each year in the United States.

Excessive alcohol use increases the risk for violence, injuries, and motor vehicle crashes. It can also increase the risk of long-term health issues such as liver disease, cancer, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and birth defects.",10/7/20 0:00,
Funeral Guidance for Individuals and Families,"Grieving the loss of a loved one during the fear and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic can be overwhelming. It may be difficult for people to make decisions about how to safely grieve and honor their loved one. This guidance is for individuals and families as they work with funeral directors, community and religious leaders, and others to plan and hold funeral services and visitations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19 by following these guiding principles.

Guiding Principles

The more people interact, the closer in distance the interaction is (less than 6 feet), and the longer the interaction lasts, the higher the risk of spreading COVID-19.

The higher the level of community transmission in an area, the higher the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Masks help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19, particularly if social distancing cannot be maintained.

During an in-person gathering, convene in outdoors or in well-ventilated areas, if possible, rather than poorly ventilated, indoor areas to help lower risk of spreading COVID-19. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor gatherings.

Avoid sharing commonly used objects such as religious aids (e.g., religious books, collection plates, programs, etc.,) to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Reducing the number of people who are engaged in activities like singing or chanting as these behaviors can increase the amount of respiratory virus in the air.

Practice increased hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and objects to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Practice social distancing by maintaining at least 6 feet between attendees; facility or lay staff; and clergy or officiants, especially when small, in-person services are held.

Take extra precautions for those at increased risk for COVID-19, particularly those who are older or have pre-existing conditions, to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.

The risk of COVID-19 spreading at gatherings and services is ranked as follows, from lowest to highest:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only services and gatherings.

Lower risk: Smaller outdoor, in-person services and gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear masks, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person services and gatherings, either indoors or outdoors, adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, with some individuals wearing face masks and with some attendees coming from outside the local area. Sharing of items or objects is limited.

Highest risk: Large in-person services and gatherings held indoors and where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart; many attendees travel from outside the local area. Few individuals wear masks and objects are shared.

In some situations, many people have become sick with COVID-19 after attending a funeral service. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in communities, changes need to be made to the way funerals, visitations, and memorials to the deceased are held. This guidance provides strategies to protect yourself and others when you are grieving the loss of a loved one, supporting each other, making funeral arrangements, and participating in funeral services and visitations. Some examples include:

Using technology to connect virtually with family and friends during the grieving process.

Considering modified funeral arrangements, such as limiting attendance at funerals held during shortly after the time of death to a small number of immediate family members and friends; and then holding additional memorial services when social distancing guidelines are less restrictive.

Practicing social distancing by maintaining at least 6 feet between attendees, facility staff, and clergy or officiants when small, in-person services are held.

Considering modifications to funeral rites and rituals (for example, avoid touching the deceased person’s body or personal belongings or other ceremonial objects) to make sure of everyone’s safety.

Wearing masks while around others and outside of your home.

Grieving the loss of a loved one

Grief is a normal response to losing someone important to you. When a loved one dies, it is important for friends and family to be able to share stories and memories of the person and how they influenced their lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the ability of friends and family to come together in person and grieve in typical ways. This is true regardless of whether the person’s death was due to COVID-19 or some other cause.

Given the COVID-19 pandemic, hosting gatherings now could be dangerous to those who would want to participate. Family and friends are finding alternate ways to connect, support each other, and grieve after their loss. They understand the need to possibly plan for additional memorial services when COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted.

Take actions to help you cope with the loss of a loved one

Grief is a universal emotion, but no two people experience grief in exactly the same way. Some actions you can take to help you cope with feelings of grief while practicing social distancing and honoring your loved one include:

Invite people to call you, or host conference calls with family members and friends to stay connected.

Ask family and friends to share stories and pictures with you via phone, video chat, email, text message, photo sharing apps, social media, or mailed letters.

Create a virtual memory book, blog, or webpage to remember your loved one, and ask family and friends to contribute their memories and stories.

Coordinate a date and time for family and friends to honor your loved one by reciting a selected poem, spiritual reading, or prayer from within their own households. Some cultures practice a prolonged mourning period with multiple observances, so hosting virtual events now and in-person events later may be in keeping with these practices.

Seek spiritual support from faith-based organizations, including religious leaders and congregations, if applicable. People who are not part of a faith tradition or religious community can seek support from other trusted community leaders and friends.

Use grief counseling services, support groups, or hotlines external icon , especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider.

, especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider. Read books about grief and loss. If you have children, read age-appropriate books with them and talk with them about how they are feeling.

Take part in an activity that has significance to you and the loved one you have lost, such as planting flowers or a tree or preparing a favorite meal, in memory of your loved one.

Review additional information from CDC on loss and grief, and ways to cope with stress and anxiety.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family and close friends of a person who died of COVID-19 may experience stigma, such as people avoiding them or rejecting them. Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger toward other people. Some people may avoid contact with you, your family members, and friends when they would normally reach out to you. You can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with extended family, friends, and others in your community.

Making Funeral Arrangements COVID-19 does not need to affect whether the funeral takes place through burial or cremation. Wishes of your deceased family member or friend may continue to be honored.

In general, there is no need to delay funeral services and visitations due to COVID-19. However, some changes to traditional practices are likely needed. Family members may need to discuss timing of services with funeral service providers, who may be overwhelmed.

Family members may need to discuss timing of services with funeral service providers, who may be overwhelmed. COVID-19 is a new disease, and we are still learning how it spreads. There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral service or visitation with the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 after the body has been prepared for viewing.

Take precautions when planning and holding funeral services and visitations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among those in attendance, including those who may not have symptoms.

Practice social distancing while making funeral arrangements

Consider having virtual or phone meetings instead of in-person meetings with funeral home staff, cemetery staff, clergy or officiants, and others to plan funeral arrangements.

If you need to meet in person, follow everyday preventive actions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19, such as wearing a mask, social distancing, washing your hands often, and covering coughs and sneezes.

Do not attend in-person meetings if you are sick or if you might have been exposed to COVID-19. Those who have higher risk of severe illness should weigh the benefits of in-person attendance against risk of exposure to a person with COVID-19, especially if recommendations for wearing masks and social distancing may be difficult to follow for themselves or others.

Discuss options for making changes to traditional funeral plans

Discuss your cultural or religious traditions and the funeral wishes of the deceased, if applicable, with family members and the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiants). Identify any potential concerns and determine options to make changes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Preserve traditional practices when it is possible to safely do so, and identify whether modified or new practices could satisfy the needs and values of you and your loved one.

Consider whether it would be acceptable to hold modified funeral arrangements by limiting attendance to a small number of immediate family members and friends shortly after the time of death. Consider holding additional memorial services in the future when social distancing guidelines are less restrictive. When you are making decisions about who should attend, consider how emotionally difficult social distancing practices might be for attendees (such as keeping at least 6 feet apart and not hugging other attendees who do not live in their household).

Ask the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiant) about resources they may be able to provide, such as: Virtual funeral services, visitations, and memorial tributes by online video streaming or recorded video. Consider potential issues with virtual attendees’ access to technology and high-speed internet, as well as how any technological difficulties during the service could impact the event. Online guestbooks or memory books that invite people to share stories, notes of condolence, or photos. Assistance with sharing details about the plan for funeral services and visitations with extended family and friends, including how to compassionately communicate any changes to traditional practices and the reasons they are necessary.



Holding funeral services and visitations

Familial and cultural expectations might put pressure on you and others to participate in or hold or schedule funeral services and visitations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, those expectations may need to be relaxed to protect the safety of those who would have participated. People continue to get exposed to COVID-19 at funeral services; the people giving it to others were not feeling sick at the time and did not know they were carrying or spreading COVID-19.

Consider the following modifications to funeral services and visitations to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These modifications are recommended for events held in any setting, including funeral homes, cemetery facilities, places of worship, private homes, and other venues.

Limit the attendees to a small number of immediate family and close friends

Follow the guidelines from state and local officials and state and local external icon health departments.

Those who have higher risk of severe illness should weigh the benefits of in-person attendance against risk of exposure to a person with COVID-19, especially if recommendations for wearing masks and social distancing may be difficult to follow for themselves or others

Consider limiting the number of people from different areas of the country or any areas with significant spread of COVID-19.

Consider offering other ways for family and friends to participate, such as by phone or online (live or recorded).

Practice social distancing and everyday preventive actions

Consider holding services and gatherings in a large, well-ventilated area or outdoors, as circumstances and traditions allow.

Space out seating for attendees who do not live in the same household to at least 6 feet apart between household groups.

Attendees who do not live in the same household should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart and wear a mask when interacting with people who do not live in their household.

People who have been living in the same household can comfort each other in typical ways such as hugging, holding hands, and sitting next to each other.

Attendees should nod, bow, or wave instead of holding or shaking hands, hugging, or kissing anyone who does not live in their household.

Consider limiting the number of people engaged in activities that produce respiratory droplets, which may contain virus, (e.g., singing or chanting) especially when participants are indoors and in close proximity to each other. If attendees choose to sing or chant, encourage them to wear masks and increase distance between people to greater than 6 feet.

All attendees should follow everyday preventive actions to protect themselves and others from COVID-19, such as washing your hands often and covering coughs and sneezes.

Consider changing traditional rituals or practices

Discuss with the funeral home director, clergy or officiant, and your family any potential changes that might be necessary to protect all of the participants and attendees. Consider options for modified or new practices that would be acceptable to you and your family and friends, such as:

Holding a graveside-only service.

Changing or removing funeral practices that involve close contact or sharing things among members of different households, such as: Sharing a car or limousine ride between the church and cemetery. Providing food and beverages for attendees after the service.

Changing religious rituals in consultation with clergy and other religious leaders.

If some traditions, such as certain religious rituals, sharing rides to the gravesite, or having food and beverages, are considered essential to you and your family and friends, consider modifying them.

Limit sharing of items, such as worship aids, prayer books, and other items shared or passed by clergy and attendees during religious rituals.

Group household members together inside the vehicle. Avoid having non-household members sharing vehicles to travel between locations during the services; if necessary, increase ventilation by opening windows or using the air conditioner on non-recirculating mode.

If food is offered at a reception, have individual pre-packaged boxes or bags instead of a potluck, buffet, or family-style meal. Avoid sharing of foods and utensils.

In some cultures, bringing food or gifts to grieving family members is an important way to express care and concern. During the COVID-19 pandemic, consider expressing care in ways that do not involve personal interactions. Consider delivering food or gifts to grieving family members in ways that keep people at least 6 feet apart, mailing care packages, or giving families gift cards for food delivery services.

Avoid touching the deceased person’s body before preparation

There are many different cultural traditions involved in the bereavement process, including some that involve touching the deceased person’s body before preparation. Though we are still learning more about how COVID-19 spreads, it may be possible that you could get COVID-19 by touching the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 prior to the body being prepared for viewing. After the body has been prepared for viewing, there may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging.

Take steps to protect yourself, such as:

Avoid touching, hugging, or kissing the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 before and during body preparation, especially if you or a member of your household are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after any contact with the body. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Take precautions with rituals that involve touching the deceased person’s body

If the deceased person had confirmed or suspected COVID-19, avoid kissing, washing, or shrouding the body before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. Take precautions if participating in these activities is part of important religious or cultural practices.

Work with your cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff to identify how to reduce exposure as much as possible.

People at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and members of their household should not be involved in these activities.

People conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves (nitrile, latex, or rubber). Additional protective equipment may also be required, such as disposable and waterproof isolation gowns, face shields or goggles, and facemasks (e.g., if splashing of fluids is expected).

Following preparation of the body, safely remove gloves (and other protective equipment, if used) and throw them away. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Shower as soon as possible.

If you did not wear an isolation gown while preparing the body, wash your clothes in the warmest setting possible and dry them completely.

If removing personal possessions (such as wedding rings) from the body or casket, clean and disinfect external icon the items and wash hands right away.

Safely gather your loved one’s belongings

If desired, you may retrieve the belongings of a loved one who has died of COVID-19 outside their home (for example, in a hospital setting). Depending on local rules and regulations, family members may retrieve these belongings at the funeral home or the healthcare facility.

You should use gloves and practice good hand hygiene when handling your loved ones’ belongings. Depending on the type of belongings, such as electronics, you should also follow the household item-specific cleaning and disinfection guidelines when handling these items.",2/11/20 0:00,
COVID-19 and Animals,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, infect only animals and do not infect humans.

Risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people

Some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to humans and then spread between people, but this is rare. This is what happened with the virus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19, with the virus likely originating in bats. The first reported infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person to person.

The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking. Recent studies show that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.

Risk of people spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to animals

The first US case of an animal testing positive for COVID-19 was a tiger at a NY zoo.

We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations, especially after close contact with a person sick with COVID-19.

Animals that can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19

We know that cats, dogs, and a few other types of animals can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but we don’t yet know all of the animals that can get infected. There have been reports of animals being infected with the virus worldwide.

A small number of pet cats and dogs have been reported to be infected with the virus in several countries, including the United States. Most of these pets became sick after contact with people with COVID-19.

Several lions and tigers external icon at a New York zoo tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after showing signs of respiratory illness. Public health officials believe these large cats became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected with SARS-CoV-2. All of these large cats have fully recovered.

Public health officials believe these large cats became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected with SARS-CoV-2. All of these large cats have fully recovered. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in mink (which are closely related to ferrets) on multiple farms in the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, and the United States external icon . SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed mink has been characterized by respiratory disease and an increased mortality rate. Because some workers on these farms had symptoms of COVID-19, it is likely that infected farm workers were the source of the mink infections. Currently, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to people. However, reports from infected mink farms in the Netherlands suggest that in these environments there is the possibility for spread of SARS-CoV-2 from mink to humans. Additionally, some farm cats and dogs on mink farms in Europe also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting they had been exposed to the virus.

.

CDC, USDA, and state public health and animal health officials are working in some states to conduct active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in pets, including cats, dogs, and other small mammals, that had contact with a person with COVID-19. These animals are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and also tested to see whether the pet develops antibodies to this virus. This work is being done to help us better understand how common SARS-CoV-2 infection might be in pets as well as the possible role of pets in the spread of this virus.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) maintains a listexternal icon of all animals with confirmed infections with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.

Research on animals and COVID-19

Research on SARS-Cov-2 in animals is limited, but studies are underway to learn more about how this virus can affect different animals.

Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.

A number of studies have investigated non-human primates as models for human infection. Rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, Grivets, and common marmosets can become infected SARS-CoV-2 and become sick in a laboratory setting.

Mice, pigs, chickens, and ducks do not seem to become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.

Data from one study suggest some dogs can get infected but might not spread the virus to other dogs as easily compared to cats and ferrets, which can easily spread the virus to other animals of the same species

These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people. More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.

What to do if you own pets

Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from a possible infection.

Because there is a risk that people with COVID-19 could spread the virus to animals, CDC recommends that pet owners limit their pet’s interaction with people outside their household.

Keep cats indoors when possible and do not let them roam freely outside.

Walk dogs on a leash at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others.

Avoid public places where a large number of people gather.

Protect pets if you are sick

If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed by a test), you should restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would with people. Until we know more about this virus, people sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals.

When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.

Avoid contact with your pet including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, sharing food, and sleeping in the same bed.

If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a mask and wash your hands before and after you interact with them.

If you are sick with COVID-19 and your pet becomes sick, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Call your veterinarian and let them know you have been sick with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.

Stay healthy around animals

In the United States, there is no evidence that animals are playing a significant role in the spread of COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals.

10 Things Healthcare Professionals Need to Know about U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Plans,"In the United States, there is currently no authorized or approved vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Operation Warp Speedexternal icon has been working since the pandemic started to make a COVID-19 vaccine(s) available as soon as possible. CDC is focused on vaccine planning, working closely with health departments and partners to get ready for when a vaccine(s) is available. CDC does not have a role in developing COVID-19 vaccines.

With the possibility of one or more COVID-19 vaccines becoming available before the end of the year, here are 10 things healthcare professionals need to know about where those plans currently stand.",2/11/20 0:00,
Health Equity Considerations and Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups,"Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put many people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19. The term “racial and ethnic minority groups” includes people of color with a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. But some experiences are common to many people within these groups, and social determinants of health have historically prevented them from having fair opportunities for economic, physical, and emotional health. [1]

There is increasing evidence that some racial and ethnic minority groups are being disproportionately affected by COVID-19. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] Inequities in the social determinants of health, such as poverty and healthcare access, affecting these groups are interrelated and influence a wide range of health and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.[1] To achieve health equity, barriers must be removed so that everyone has a fair opportunity to be as healthy as possible.

Factors that contribute to increased risk

Some of the many inequities in social determinants of health that put racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19 include:

Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination exists in systems meant to protect well-being or health. Examples of such systems include health care, housing, education, criminal justice, and finance. Discrimination, which includes racism, can lead to chronic and toxic stress and shapes social and economic factors that put some people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk for COVID-19.[5], [7], [8], [9]

Healthcare access and utilization : People from some racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be uninsured than non-Hispanic whites. [10] Healthcare access can also be limited for these groups by many other factors, such as lack of transportation, child care, or ability to take time off of work; communication and language barriers; cultural differences between patients and providers; and historical and current discrimination in healthcare systems. [11] Some people from racial and ethnic minority groups may hesitate to seek care because they distrust the government and healthcare systems responsible for inequities in treatment [12] and historical events such as the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the African American Male and sterilization without people’s permission. [13], [14], [15], [16]

Occupation : People from some racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately represented in essential work settings such as healthcare facilities, farms, factories, grocery stores, and public transportation. [17] Some people who work in these settings have more chances to be exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 due to several factors, such as close contact with the public or other workers, not being able to work from home, and not having paid sick days. [18]

Educational, income, and wealth gaps : Inequities in access to high-quality education for some racial and ethnic minority groups can lead to lower high school completion rates and barriers to college entrance. This may limit future job options and lead to lower paying or less stable jobs. [19] People with limited job options likely have less flexibility to leave jobs that may put them at a higher risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. People in these situations often cannot afford to miss work, even if they’re sick, because they do not have enough money saved up for essential items like food and other important living needs.

People in these situations often cannot afford to miss work, even if they’re sick, because they do not have enough money saved up for essential items like food and other important living needs. Housing: Some people from racial and ethnic minority groups live in crowded conditions that make it more challenging to follow prevention strategies. In some cultures, it is common for family members of many generations to live in one household. In addition, growing and disproportionate unemployment rates for some racial and ethnic minority groups during the COVID-19 pandemic[19] may lead to greater risk of eviction and homelessness or sharing of housing.

These factors and others are associated with more COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in areas where racial and ethnic minority groups live, learn, work, play, and worship.[5],[10], [20], [21] They have also contributed to higher rates of some medical conditions that increase one’s risk of severe illness from COVID-19. In addition, community strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19 may cause unintentional harm, such as lost wages, reduced access to services, and increased stress, for some racial and ethnic minority groups. [22]

What We Can Do

The COVID-19 pandemic may change some of the ways we connect and support each other. As individuals and communities respond to COVID-19 recommendations and circumstances (e.g., school closures, workplace closures, social distancing), there are often unintended negative impacts on emotional well-being such as loss of social connectedness and support. Shared faith, family, and cultural bonds are common sources of social support. Finding ways to maintain support and connection, even when physically apart, can empower and encourage individuals and communities to protect themselves, care for those who become sick, keep kids healthy, and better cope with stress.

Community- and faith-based organizations, employers, healthcare systems and providers, public health agencies, policy makers, and others all have a part in helping to promote fair access to health. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, we must work together to ensure that people have resources to maintain and manage their physical and mental health, including easy access to information, affordable testing, and medical and mental health care. We need programs and practices that fit the communities where racial and minority groups live, learn, work, play, and worship.

Caring for People with Disabilities,"What do Direct Service Providers for people with disabilities need to know about COVID-19?

Direct Service Providers (DSPs) include personal care attendants, direct support professionals, paraprofessionals, therapists, and others. They provide a wide variety of home and community-based, health-related services that support people with disabilitiesexternal icon. Services provided may include personal care, activities of daily living, access to health services, and more. DSPs have close and consistent contact with people with disabilities and those providing healthcare support services in day and residential programs for people with disabilities. DSPs are considered to be in the same general risk category as health care personnel. DSPs are essential for the health and well-being of the people they serve. DSPs should be aware of how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads, risk factors, and prevention actions.

Some groups may be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Knowing how COVID-19 spreads can help DSPs protect themselves and others.

Here are commonly asked questions that DSPs have about caring for people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

How can I protect myself and the people I work with?

As a DSP, your risk of exposure will depend on factors including the setting you work in, the number of people you provide services to, and the spread of COVID-19 in your community. Check with your employer for any specific policies and procedures related to COVID-19 and practice everyday prevention actions when working with clients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In addition:

When possible, keep at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and others in the home or community setting.

Wear a mask when you are at work.

Encourage your client to wear a mask. Wearing masks may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues. Masks are not recommended for children under 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance.

If there is potential that you may be splashed or sprayed by bodily fluids during your work, use standard precautions. Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes a facemask, eye protection, disposable gloves, and a gown.

Wash your hands with soap and water: when entering and leaving the home or community setting; when adjusting or putting on or off facemasks; or before putting on and after taking off disposable gloves. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Learn more about proper handwashing.

Wear disposable gloves when touching the client (e.g., dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, toileting, feeding), handling tissues, when changing linens or doing laundry. Safely dispose of gloves after use. As noted above, wash your hands before and after taking off disposable gloves. If gloves are unavailable, wash hands immediately after touching the client or handling their belongings.

Launder work uniforms or clothes after each use with the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.

If you work in the home of an individual with disabilities, also practice these additional prevention actions:

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (e.g., counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, bedside tables), and equipment (e.g., wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, canes, oxygen tanks and tubing, communication boards and other assistive devices).

Help the client plan for possible changes in service due to COVID-19. Plan for what to do if you or other DSPs get sick. Create a contact list of family, friends, neighbors and local service agencies that can provide support. Review with the client: How to monitor for symptoms. When and how to contact their healthcare provider. Many healthcare providers have developed new ways to provide healthcare services, such as using telehealth. Help the client find out how those are arranged and any additional information.



Help make or update care plans or an emergency notebook. Care plans typically include important information about a person’s medical conditions, how to manage those conditions, how to contact healthcare providers, therapists and pharmacy, information on allergies, medications (names, dosages, and administration instructions), preferences (food and other), daily routines and activities. This information may help the client and new DSPs provide consistent care if the usual provider is unavailable.

Plan at least two ways of communicating from home and work that can be used rapidly in an emergency (e.g., landline phone, cell phone, text-messaging, email). Write this information down for both you and the client. Each of you should keep a copy with you.

Plan to have enough household items and groceries for a few weeks, at least a 30-day supply of over the counter and prescription medicines and any medical equipment or supplies that might be needed. Some health plans allow for a 90-day refill on prescription medications. Make a photocopy of prescriptions, as this may help in obtaining medications in an emergency.



If you provide services for a client in a community-based setting, such as a group home or day program,

Follow any employer, facility, and program guidance for additional precautions related to COVID-19.

Encourage the clients you work with to practice everyday prevention actions, if possible, and assist them when needed.

Follow everyday prevention actions if there are no known or suspected cases of COVID-19 in the community-based setting where you work.

CDC has also provided guidance for group homes for people with disabilities. Many of the recommendations for COVID-19 preparation and response described in that guidance document also apply to DSPs.

What if my client or someone they live with has been exposed to COVID-19, has symptoms of COVID-19, or tests positive for COVID-19?

What if I become sick or am exposed to someone who has COVID-19?

Stay home and self-isolate, except to get medical care. Staying at home helps protect the people you work with who may be at greater risk of infection or severe illness from COVID-19. It also helps protect others in the community.

If you develop symptoms such as a fever, cough, difficulty breathing, or new loss of taste or smell or you have been exposed to COVID-19, call your healthcare provider for further guidance.

Notify your employer, the client with disabilities and, if applicable, their guardian as soon as possible so appropriate plans for an alternate DSP can be made. The client should be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms.

Are my clients at increased risk for becoming infected or having severe illness from COVID-19?

People with one of the disability types listed may be at increased risk of becoming infected or having severe illness from COVID-19.

People who have limited mobility and/or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected

People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing

People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness

People who are blind or have low vision who rely on touch or tactile information

People who need alternative communication methods, such as sign language or braille, who may not have access to information

Adults with disabilities are three times more likely than adults without disabilities to have serious underlying medical conditions. They may have an increased risk for serious illness from COVID-19 if they are older adults live in a long-term care facility or have certain underlying medical conditions. Learn more about people who are at higher risk for severe illness.

How can I cope with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Remember to take care of your physical and mental health as you continue to provide important services to people with disabilities. It is important for you to maintain healthy behaviors, manage stress, and seek additional support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are some important steps to take to help you manage and cope with stress:

Take care of your body. Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals. Exercise regularly. Get plenty of sleep. Avoid alcohol and drugs.

Make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade. Try to do some other activities you enjoy.

Caring for People with Developmental and Behavioral Disorders,"People with developmental and behavioral disorders may live in group homes or interact with Direct Service Providers (DSPs). CDC has provided guidance for group homes and DSPs who provide assistance to people with disabilities. Many of the recommendations for COVID-19 preparation and response described in those guidance documents also apply to caregivers and DSPs for people with developmental and behavioral disorders.

Accommodations, modifications, and assistance

Special considerations may be needed for people with developmental and behavioral disorders who have limited mobility, have difficulty accessing information, require close contact with Direct Service Providers, have trouble understanding information, have difficulties with changes in routines, or have other concerns related to their disability. They may need special considerations for communication and preventive actions such as:

Check with organizations that support people with developmental and behavioral disorders for communication tools and other resources related to COVID-19.

Social distancing and isolating may be difficult for them, and they may require reminders or supervision.

Wearing masks may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues. Masks are not recommended for children under 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance.

Covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing and/or coughing (when not wearing a mask), throwing it in the trash, and washing hands afterwards may require assistance or visual and verbal reminders.

Cleaning and disinfecting may affect those with sensory or respiratory issues.

Hand washing or using a hand sanitizer may require assistance or supervision.

Cleaning and disinfecting may require assistance or supervision.

Developmental monitoring and screening of children during COVID-19

Children should continue to have their development monitored and receive recommended developmental screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Developmental monitoring and screening can occur through a healthcare provider’s office, a childcare center, WIC programs, and other early childhood programs. Parents of children 2 months to 5 years of age can monitor their child’s development using CDC’s Free Milestone Tracker app.

If there are developmental concerns for a child under three years old, the child may qualify for their state’s early intervention program. Evaluations for early intervention and early intervention services are still occurring during COVID-19.

If a child is three years or older, the child may qualify for services through their local school system. These services can include pre-school and K-12 special education; therapies such as speech, occupational, and physical therapy; and more. Contact the local school system’s Department of Special Education to see how to access evaluations and services during COVID-19.

Distance learning for college or graduate school students with developmental or behavioral disorders

Encourage students to discuss any necessary accommodations they need for online learning with their school’s disability resource center (DRC). If students have internet access issues or new technology needs, the DRC may be able to loan them equipment. State Vocational Rehabilitation Agenciesexternal icon may also be able to help with accessing technology. Advise students to contact their professors to let them know of any new accommodations that the DRC has approved and find out how to access virtual office hours.

Other services may still be offered such as university counseling centers for telehealth visits and academic counselors to help students plan for summer and fall semesters.

Parents supporting children with distance learning

If you have a child who receives special education services, accommodations or services received in school through their 504 plan or Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) should be continued, as much as possible, while learning at home. Many schools are continuing interventions like speech therapy, small group classes, extended time and more. If your child or family is struggling with the challenges of homeschooling, talk with his or her teachers to find ways to help.

For some families, this may be a good time to reassess a child’s strengths related to learning and identify areas where a child may need more support. See which interventions and strategies are helpful for your child’s learning and which ones are not. Take notes and bring your observations and questions to the next reassessment or IEP meeting.

Children with learning and developmental differences may also experience stress and anxiety. The changes related to COVID-19 can add to their stress. Some children may have more difficulty expressing their emotions and some may need assistance in developing and using coping skills. Learn more about helping children cope with emergencies.

Guidance for Child Care Programs that Remain Open,"Summary of recent changes: Includes additional options for screening children upon arrival to ensure that children who have a fever or other signs of illness are not admitted to the facility.

The additional options may be useful when personal protective equipment (PPE) is in short supply.

These additional considerations are intended to provide guidance for a range of child care programs, including: Family child care programs, also known as home-based child care

Pre-K (Pre-kindergarten) programs at private and public schools

Head Start and Early Head Start programs

Private child care centers

Temporary child care centers operated by municipalities for the children of essential service providers, such as first responders, healthcare workers, transit workers, and other industries where a parent cannot stay home

Child care centers that partner with healthcare facilities to support healthcare workers who need child care This information is intended for child care programs that remain open and should be used in conjunction with CDC’s guidance for administrators of child care programs and K-12 schools. This guidance does not supersede applicable federal, state, and local laws and policies for child care programs.

General Preparedness and Planning

As you think about how your facility will deal with the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is important to work with your local health officials, school districts, child care licensing boards/bodies, child care accreditation bodies, health consultants, and other community partners to determine the most appropriate plan and action. This document is meant to help administrators create emergency operations plans and tailor them to your community’s level of transmission.

No matter the level of transmission in a community, every child care program should have a plan in place to protect staff, children, and their families from the spread of COVID-19. See CDC’s guidance for more details.

Prevent the Spread of COVID-19

Plan ahead to ensure adequate supplies to support hand hygiene behaviors and routine cleaning of objects and surfaces. If you have difficulty in obtaining these supplies, please contact your local Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) Agency to learn more about service organizations in your community who may have additional resources. Your local CCR&R Agency can be found under “Resourcesexternal icon” at Child Care Aware of America.

Encourage staff to take everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory illness.

Wash hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

Remember to supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

Cover cough and sneezes.

Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when you have to go out in public.

Masks should NOT be put on babies and children under age two because of the danger of suffocation.

Require sick children and staff to stay home.

Communicate to parents the importance of keeping children home when they are sick.

Communicate to staff the importance of being vigilant for symptoms and staying in touch with facility management if or when they start to feel sick.

Establish procedures to ensure children and staff who come to the child care center sick or become sick while at your facility are sent home as soon as possible.

Keep sick children and staff separate from well children and staff until they can be sent home.

Sick staff members should not return to work until they have met the criteria to discontinue home isolation.

Have a plan if someone is or becomes sick.

Plan to have an isolation room or area (such as a cot in a corner of the classroom) that can be used to isolate a sick child. Additional information about isolation in related settings can be found here: isolation at home and isolation in healthcare settings.

Be ready to follow CDC guidance on how to disinfect your building or facility if someone is sick.

If a sick child has been isolated in your facility, clean and disinfect surfaces in your isolation room or area after the sick child has gone home.

If COVID-19 is confirmed in a child or staff member: Close off areas used by the person who is sick. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the areas. Wait up to 24 hours or as long as possible before you clean or disinfect to allow respiratory droplets to settle before cleaning and disinfecting. Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as offices, bathrooms, and common areas. If more than 7 days have passed since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routine cleaning and disinfection.



Monitor and Plan for Absenteeism Among Your Staff

Develop plans to cover classes in the event of increased staff absences. Coordinate with other local child care programs and reach out to substitutes to determine their anticipated availability if regular staff members need to stay home if they or their family members are sick.

Recommend that people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions) consult with their medical provider to assess their risk and to determine if they should stay home if there is an outbreak in their community.

Review plans for implementing social distancing strategies

Social distancing focuses on remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance from others when possible. Detailed guidance for implementing social distancing strategies in child care centers and schools is found here: Social Distancing Strategies

Assess Group Gatherings and Events

Follow current guidance about gatherings and events.

Plan to limit nonessential visitors and postpone or cancel use of classroom volunteers.

If Your Child Care Program Remains Open

Child care programs that remain open during the COVID-19 pandemic should address these additional considerations:

Some schools, child care programs, and service organizations are supporting their communities by providing temporary or emergency child care services for the children of essential service providers such as first responders, healthcare workers, transit or food retail workers, and persons who do not have paid leave, cannot work from home, or do not have a family caregiver at home. If you re-purpose your school or service facility as an emergency or temporary child care center, please follow CDC guidance for administrators of child care programs and K-12 schools.

Be sure to follow state and local child care licensing policies and regulations external icon . Specifically, all facilities should continue to adhere to their state and local licensing policies unless otherwise notified by their local health department.

. Specifically, all facilities should continue to adhere to their state and local licensing policies unless otherwise notified by their local health department. Guidance may also be provided by the department of education and/or health department in your state, city, or locality.

Social Distancing Strategies

Work with your local health officials to determine a set of strategies appropriate for your community’s situation. Continue using preparedness strategies and consider the following social distancing strategies:

If possible, child care classes should include the same group each day, and the same child care providers should remain with the same group each day. If your child care program remains open, consider creating a separate classroom or group for the children of healthcare workers and other first responders. If your program is unable to create a separate classroom, consider serving only the children of healthcare workers and first responders.

Cancel or postpone special events such as festivals, holiday events, and special performances.

Consider whether to alter or halt daily group activities that may promote transmission. Keep each group of children in a separate room. Limit the mixing of children, such as staggering playground times and keeping groups separate for special activities such as art, music, and exercising. If possible, at nap time, ensure that children’s naptime mats (or cribs) are spaced out as much as possible, ideally 6 feet apart. Consider placing children head to toe in order to further reduce the potential for viral spread.

Consider staggering arrival and drop off times and/or have child care providers come outside the facility to pick up the children as they arrive. Your plan for curb side drop off and pick up should limit direct contact between parents and staff members and adhere to social distancing recommendations.

If possible, arrange for administrative staff to telework from their homes.

Parent Drop-Off and Pick-Up

Hand hygiene stations should be set up at the entrance of the facility, so that children can clean their hands before they enter. If a sink with soap and water is not available, provide hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol next to parent sign-in sheets. Keep hand sanitizer out of children’s reach and supervise use. If possible, place sign-in stations outside, and provide sanitary wipes for cleaning pens between each use.

Consider staggering arrival and drop off times and plan to limit direct contact with parents as much as possible. Have child care providers greet children outside as they arrive. Designate a parent to be the drop off/pick up volunteer to walk all children to their classroom, and at the end of the day, walk all children back to their cars. Infants could be transported in their car seats. Store car seat out of children’s reach.

Ideally, the same parent or designated person should drop off and pick up the child every day. If possible, older people such as grandparents or those with serious underlying medical conditions should not pick up children, because they are more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Screen Children Upon Arrival (if possible)

Persons who have a fever of 100.40 (38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the facility. Encourage parents to be on the alert for signs of illness in their children and to keep them home when they are sick. Screen children upon arrival, if possible.

There are several methods that facilities can use to protect their workers while conducting temperature screenings. The most protective methods incorporate social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others) or physical barriers to eliminate or minimize exposures due to close contact to a child who has symptoms during screening.

Examples of Screening Methods

Reliance on Social Distancing (example 1)

Ask parents/guardians to take their child’s temperature either before coming to the facility or upon arrival at the facility. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the parent/guardian and child.

Ask the parent/guardian to confirm that the child does not have fever, shortness of breath or cough.

Make a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness.

You do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if you can maintain a distance of 6 feet.

Reliance on Barrier/Partition Controls (example 2)

Stand behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition that can serve to protect the staff member’s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced if the child being screened sneezes, coughs, or talks.

Make a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness.

Conduct temperature screening (follow steps below) Perform hand hygiene Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Put on disposable gloves.

Check the child’s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window.

Make sure your face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening.

If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals , ensure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each child and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check.

, ensure that you use a and that the in between each check. If you use disposable or non-contact (temporal) thermometers and you did not have physical contact with the child, you do not need to change gloves before the next check.

If you use non-contact thermometers, clean them with an alcohol wipe (or isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab) between each client. You can reuse the same wipe as long as it remains wet.

Reliance on Personal Protective Equipment (example 3)

If social distancing or barrier/partition controls cannot be implemented during screening, personal protective equipment (PPE) can be used when within 6 feet of a child. However, reliance on PPE alone is a less effective control and more difficult to implement, given PPE shortages and training requirements.

Upon arrival, wash your hands and put on a facemask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves. A gown could be considered if extensive contact with a child is anticipated.

Make a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness, and confirm that the child is not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.

Take the child’s temperature. If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals , ensure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each child and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If you use disposable or non-contact (temporal) thermometers and did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If you use non-contact thermometers, clean them with an alcohol wipe (or isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab) between each client. You can reuse the same wipe as long as it remains wet.

After each screening, remove and discard PPE, and wash hands.

Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol or wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

If hands are visibly soiled, soap and water should be used before using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

If your staff does not have experience in using PPE: Check to see if your facility has guidance on how to don and doff PPE. The procedure to don and doff should be tailored to the specific type of PPE that you have available at your facility. If your facility does not have specific guidance, the CDC has recommended sequences for donning and doffing PPE pdf icon .



Clean and Disinfect

Caring for Our Childrenexternal icon (CFOC) provides national standards for cleaning, sanitizing and disinfection of educational facilities for children. Toys that can be put in the mouth should be cleaned and sanitized (see below). Other hard surfaces, including diaper changing stations, door knobs, and floors can be disinfected.

Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts:

Facilities should develop a schedule for cleaning and disinfecting. An example can be found here pdf icon external icon .

. Routinely clean, sanitize, and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially toys and games. This may also include cleaning objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily such as doorknobs, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops, nap pads, toilet training potties, desks, chairs, cubbies, and playground structures. Use the cleaners typically used at your facility. Guidance is available for the selection of appropriate sanitizers or disinfectants pdf icon external icon for child care settings.

for child care settings. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label. For disinfection, most common EPA-registered, fragrance-free household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here external icon . If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for concentration, application method, and contact time for all cleaning and disinfection products.

. If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for concentration, application method, and contact time for all cleaning and disinfection products. If possible, provide EPA-registered disposable wipes to child care providers and other staff members so that commonly used surfaces such as keyboards, desks, and remote controls can be wiped down before use. If wipes are not available, please refer to CDC’s guidance on disinfection for community settings.

All cleaning materials should be kept secure and out of reach of children.

Cleaning products should not be used near children, and staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent children from inhaling toxic fumes.

Clean and Sanitize Toys

Tips for cleaning toys

Toys that cannot be cleaned and sanitized should not be used.

Toys that children have placed in their mouths or that are otherwise contaminated by body secretions or excretions should be set aside until they are cleaned by hand by a person wearing gloves. Clean with water and detergent, rinse, sanitize with an EPA-registered disinfectant, rinse again, and air-dry. You may also clean in a mechanical dishwasher. Be mindful of items more likely to be placed in a child’s mouth, like play food, dishes, and utensils.

Machine washable cloth toys should be used by one individual at a time or should not be used at all. These toys should be laundered before being used by another child.

Do not share toys with other groups of infants or toddlers, unless they are washed and sanitized before being moved from one group to the other.

Set aside toys that need to be cleaned. Place in a dish pan with soapy water or put in a separate container marked for “soiled toys.” Keep dish pan and water out of reach from children to prevent risk of drowning. Washing with soapy water is the ideal method for cleaning. Try to have enough toys so that the toys can be rotated through cleanings.

Children’s books, like other paper-based materials such as mail or envelopes, are not considered a high risk for transmission and do not need additional cleaning or disinfection procedures.

Clean and Disinfect Bedding

Use bedding (sheets, pillows, blankets, sleeping bags) that can be washed. Keep each child’s bedding separate, and consider storing in individually labeled bins, cubbies, or bags. Cots and mats should be labeled for each child. Bedding that touches a child’s skin should be cleaned weekly or before use by another child.

Caring for Infants and Toddlers

Diapering

When diaperingexternal icon a child, wash your hands and wash the child’s hands before you begin, and wear gloves. Follow safe diaper changing procedures. Procedures should be posted in all diaper changing areas. Steps include:

Prepare (includes putting on gloves)

Clean the child

Remove trash (soiled diaper and wipes)

Replace diaper

Wash child’s hands

Clean up diapering station

Wash hands

After diapering, wash your hands (even if you were wearing gloves) and disinfect the diapering area with a fragrance-free bleach that is EPA-registered as a sanitizing or disinfecting solution. If other products are used for sanitizing or disinfecting, they should also be fragrance-free and EPA-registered. If the surface is dirty, it should be cleaned with detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

If reusable cloth diapers are used, they should not be rinsed or cleaned in the facility. The soiled cloth diaper and its contents (without emptying or rinsing) should be placed in a plastic bag or into a plastic-lined, hands-free covered diaper pail to give to parents/guardians or laundry service.

Download posters with diaper changing procedures.

Washing, Feeding, or Holding a Child

It is important to comfort crying, sad, and/or anxious infants and toddlers, and they often need to be held. To the extent possible, when washing, feeding, or holding very young children: Child care providers can protect themselves by wearing an over-large button-down, long sleeved shirt and by wearing long hair up off the collar in a ponytail or other updo.

Child care providers should wash their hands, neck, and anywhere touched by a child’s secretions.

Child care providers should change the child’s clothes if secretions are on the child’s clothes. They should change the button-down shirt, if there are secretions on it, and wash their hands again.

Contaminated clothes should be placed in a plastic bag or washed in a washing machine.

Infants, toddlers, and their providers should have multiple changes of clothes on hand in the child care center or home-based child care.

Child care providers should wash their hands before and after handling infant bottles prepared at home or prepared in the facility. Bottles, bottle caps, nipples, and other equipment used for bottle-feeding should be thoroughly cleaned after each use by washing in a dishwasher or by washing with a bottlebrush, soap, and water.

School nurses in schools that have been re-purposed as emergency or temporary child care centers should use Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for patients with confirmed or possible COVID-19. See: What Healthcare Personnel Should Know about Caring for Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19 Infection.

Healthy Hand Hygiene Behavior

All children, staff, and volunteers should engage in hand hygiene at the following times: Arrival to the facility and after breaks Before and after preparing food or drinks Before and after eating or handling food, or feeding children Before and after administering medication or medical ointment Before and after diapering After using the toilet or helping a child use the bathroom After coming in contact with bodily fluid After handling animals or cleaning up animal waste After playing outdoors or in sand After handling garbage

Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are not visibly dirty, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol can be used if soap and water are not readily available.

Supervise children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent ingestion.

Assist children with handwashing, including infants who cannot wash hands alone. After assisting children with handwashing, staff should also wash their hands.

Place posters describing handwashing steps near sinks. Developmentally appropriate posters in multiple languages are available from CDC.

Food Preparation and Meal Service

If a cafeteria or group dining room is typically used, serve meals in classrooms instead. If meals are typically served family-style, plate each child’s meal to serve it so that multiple children are not using the same serving utensils.

Food preparation should not be done by the same staff who diaper children.

Sinks used for food preparation should not be used for any other purposes.

Caregivers should ensure children wash hands prior to and immediately after eating.

Caregivers should wash their hands before preparing food and after helping children to eat.

Facilities should follow all other applicable federal, state, and local regulations and guidanceexternal icon related to safe preparation of food.

Vulnerable/High Risk Groups

Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. To protect those at higher risk, it’s important that everyone practices healthy hygiene behaviors.

If you have staff members or teachers age 65 or older, or with serious underlying health conditions, encourage them to talk to their healthcare provider to assess their risk and to determine if they should stay home.

Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that many children have mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. If you have children with underlying health conditions, talk to their parents about their risk. Follow children’s care plans for underlying health conditions such as an asthma action plan.

Other Resources

CDC’s website contains a variety of resources for child care programs and K-12 schools, including detailed guidance, considerations for closures, and frequently asked questions for administrators, teachers, and parents. Together, these resources provide additional information on:

What to do if a child or staff member at your facility becomes sick.

Closures of child care programs.

The resources emphasize that any decision about temporary closures of child care programs or cancellation of related events should be made in coordination with your federal, state, and local educational officials as well as state and local health officials. Child care programs are not expected to make decisions about closures on their own. The resources also address steps to ensure continuity of meal programs and other essential services if your facility is closed; additional government resources related to meals and snacks can be found here: https://www.fns.usda.gov/cacfpexternal icon

Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers,"This guidance is intended to inform pediatric healthcare providers of up-to-date information about children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and about caring for children during the pandemic. Children are defined as age 1 month to 18 years for the purpose of this document. For healthcare providers caring for neonates (≤28 days old) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, including those born to a mother with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, please refer to CDC guidance for evaluating and managing neonates at risk for COVID-19.

Infections Among Children

Incidence of COVID-19 in Children

In the United States and globally, fewer cases of COVID-19 have been reported in children (age 0-17 years) compared with adults.1,2 While children comprise 22% of the US population,3 recent data show that 7.3% of all cases of COVID-19 in the United States reported to CDC were among children (as of August 3rd, 2020).4 The number and rate of cases in children in the United States have been steadily increasing from March to July 2020. The true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not known due to lack of widespread testing and the prioritization of testing for adults and those with severe illness. Hospitalization rates in children are significantly lower than hospitalization rates in adults with COVID-19, suggesting that children may have less severe illness from COVID-19 compared to adults.5, 6 Visit CDC’s Cases, Data, and Surveillance page for current CDC data.

Infections and Transmission Among Children

It is unclear whether children are as susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 compared with adults and whether they can transmit the virus as effectively as adults. Recent evidence suggests that children likely have the same or higher viral loads in their nasopharynx compared with adults7 and that children can spread the virus effectively in households and camp settings.8,9

Due to community mitigation measures and school closures, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to and among children may have been reduced in the United States during the pandemic in the spring and early summer of 2020. This may explain the low incidence in children compared with adults. Comparing trends in pediatric infections before and after the return to in-person school and other activities may provide additional understanding about infections in children.

Symptoms and Severity of COVID-19 in Children

Clinical Presentation

The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be about the same for children as in adults, at 2-14 days with an average of 6 days.10

Signs or symptoms of COVID-19 in children include:

Fever

Fatigue

Headache

Myalgia

Cough

Nasal congestion or rhinorrhea

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Abdominal pain

Diarrhea

Nausea or vomiting

Poor appetite or poor feeding

Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have many of these non-specific symptoms, may only have a few (such as only upper respiratory symptoms or only gastrointestinal symptoms), or may be asymptomatic. The most common symptoms in children are cough and/or fever.11-15 A recent systematic review estimated that 16% of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic,16 but evidence suggests that as many as 45% of pediatric infections are asymptomatic.17 The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to other infections and noninfectious processes, including influenza, streptococcal pharyngitis, and allergic rhinitis. The lack of specificity of signs or symptoms and the significant proportion of asymptomatic infections make symptom-based screening for identification of SARS-CoV-2 in children particularly challenging.17

Severity of Illness in Children

While children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely to develop severe illness compared with adults, children are still at risk of developing severe illness and complications from COVID-19. Recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among children is low (8.0 per 100,000 population) compared with that in adults (164.5 per 100,000 population), but hospitalization rates in children are increasing. 5 While children have lower rates of mechanical ventilation and death than adults, 1 in 3 children hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States were admitted to the intensive care unit, which is the same in adults.5

Current evidence suggests that children with certain underlying medical conditions and infants (age <1 year) might be at increased risk for severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection.10,11,14 Of the children who have developed severe illness from COVID-19, most have had underlying medical conditions. 5

There is limited evidence about which underlying medical conditions in children might increase the risk for severe illness. Current evidence suggests that children with medical complexity, with genetic, neurologic, metabolic conditions, or with congenital heart disease might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Similar to adults, children with obesity, diabetes, asthma and chronic lung disease, sickle cell disease, or immunosuppression might also be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

While healthcare providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection in these populations and monitor the progression of illness closely, it appears that most infants 18 and children with certain underlying conditions such as cancer 19 who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not usually develop severe illness.

and children with certain underlying conditions such as cancer who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not usually develop severe illness. Hospitalization rates in the United States are higher among Hispanic/Latino children and black, non-Hispanic children and non-Hispanic black children compared with white children, which may be related to the higher rates of obesity and other underlying conditions among these populations.5

Similar to adults, children with severe COVID-19 may develop respiratory failure, myocarditis, shock, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, and multi-organ system failure. Some children with COVID-19 have developed other serious problems like intussusception or diabetic ketoacidosis.10,14, 20,21 Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are also at risk for developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).22 For the case definition, recommended evaluation, and current data on MIS-C cases in the United States, visit MIS-C Information for Healthcare Providers.

Testing and Recommendations for Isolation

Viral tests (nucleic acid or antigen) are recommended to diagnose acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Testing strategies, including clinical criteria for considering testing and recommended specimen type, are the same for children and adults. CDC’s guidance for the evaluation and management of neonates at risk for COVID-19 details specific testing considerations for newborns.

For more information on CDC’s recommendations for isolation, which apply to children and adults, visit: discontinuing precautions and disposition of patients with COVID-19 in healthcare settings and discontinuation of home isolation for people not in healthcare settings.

Testing, Isolation, and Quarantine for School-Aged Children

As children return to school and other in-person activities, pediatric healthcare providers should be prepared to answer questions from families about testing and when it is safe to return to school or be with people outside the household. Review CDC’s information for school administrators on symptom screening and testing for children in school as well as CDC’s Community Mitigation framework.

School-aged children should be prioritized for viral testing if they have:

Signs or symptoms of COVID-19 and close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes or more) with a person with laboratory confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection or increased likelihood for exposure (which includes living in or traveling to a community with substantial transmission as defined by the local public health department and described in CDC’s Community Mitigation framework)

No symptoms but have had close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes or more) with a person with laboratory confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Children with symptoms of an infectious disease should not attend school, but the length of time the child should stay home depends on the most likely etiology of illness (COVID-19 or not). Return to school policies for children with COVID-19 should be based on CDC’s recommendation for discontinuation of home isolation. A negative test or doctor’s note should not be required for return to school upon completion of the 10 days of isolation with improvement of symptoms.

If the child has symptoms of COVID-19, but the child has not had close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes or more) with a person with laboratory confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection and the child does not have an increased likelihood for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (which includes living in or traveling to a community with substantial transmission), he or she should be evaluated for other disease processes.​ If the child is determined to likely not have COVID-19 by a healthcare provider, he/she should be allowed to return to school according to existing school policies for non-COVID illnesses. Examples of non-COVID return to school policies include resolution of fever without antipyretics for 24 hours for non-COVID viral illnesses or after initiation of antibiotics for bacterial illnesses.

have COVID-19 by a healthcare provider, he/she should be allowed to return to school according to existing school policies for non-COVID illnesses. Examples of non-COVID return to school policies include resolution of fever without antipyretics for 24 hours for non-COVID viral illnesses or after initiation of antibiotics for bacterial illnesses. If the child has symptoms of COVID-19 and has increased likelihood for exposure (which includes living in or traveling to a community with substantial transmission), he or she should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, if possible. If the test result is negative, the child should be allowed to return to school once their symptoms of illness have improved consistent with non-COVID return to school policies. If testing cannot be obtained, the child should be considered a presumed case of COVID-19 and should isolate according to CDC’s recommendations for discontinuation of home isolation.

If the child has had close contact to someone with SARS-CoV-2, he or she should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 but must remain in quarantine for the 14-day incubation period even if results are negative, in accordance with CDC’s Quarantine If You Might Be Sick.

Laboratory and Radiographic Findings of COVID-19

Typical laboratory findings in children with COVID-19 include mild abnormalities in white blood cell count (either increased or decreased lymphocyte counts), mildly elevated inflammatory markers (including procalcitonin), and mildly elevated liver enzymes.23 Radiologic findings in children with COVID-19 include unilateral or bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph or CT, ground-glass opacities on CT, and consolidation with surrounding Halo sign on CT.23,24 CT should be used sparingly and only for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications. For more information, see recommendations from the American College of Radiologyexternal icon.

Management of COVID-19 in Children

Pediatric healthcare providers should consider the child’s clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, underlying medical conditions, and the ability for caregivers to care for the child at home when deciding whether the child may need inpatient care for COVID-19. For more information, visit Guidance for home care of people not requiring hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Provide parents resources on emergency warning signs for COVID-19 and caring for someone at home.

Currently, there are no specific drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of COVID-19. Treatment of COVID-19 remains largely supportive and includes prevention and management of complications. Remdesivirexternal icon, which has shown benefits in clinical trials in adults, is currently available through Emergency Use Authorization or compassionate use programs for children. The safety and effectiveness of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been evaluated in children. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that dexamethasoneexternal icon may be beneficial in pediatric patients with COVID-19 respiratory disease who are on mechanical ventilation. For more information, review considerations for childrenexternal icon in NIH’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines.25

For information on evaluation and management of MIS-C, visit MIS-C Information for Healthcare Providers.

It is important to remember that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 can present with other serious conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis or intussusception, and a broad differential must be maintained in evaluating ill children during the COVID-19 pandemic.10,14,20,21,26-29 Standard evaluation and management of co-occurring conditions should be maintained for a child infected with SARS-CoV-2, with additional infection control measures. Pediatric providers should have an appropriate suspicion for COVID-19, but also to continue to consider and test for other diagnoses, such as community acquired pneumoniaexternal icon and influenza (see CDC’s Flu Information for Healthcare Professionals for more information).

CDC has specific guidance for inpatient obstetric healthcare settings and the evaluation and management of neonates at risk for COVID-19. Additionally, several other organizations have published guidelines related to the treatment and management of adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19:

Immunizations and Well-Child Care

Community mitigation measures such as shelter-in-place orders resulted in declines in outpatient pediatric visits and fewer vaccine doses administered during the early COVID-19 pandemic,30 leaving children at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Healthcare providers should work with families to keep children up to date with all recommended vaccinations, especially with influenza vaccinations for the 2020-2021 influenza season. For more information on influenza, visit CDC’s Influenza page. For more information on immunization services and vaccination recommendations during the pandemic, visit Vaccination Guidance.

Healthcare providers should identify children who have missed well-child visits and/or recommended vaccinations and contact them to schedule in-person appointments, with prioritization of infants, children age < 24 months and school-aged children. Developmental surveillance and early childhood screenings, including developmental and autism screening, should continue along with referrals for early intervention services and further evaluation if concerns are identified.

All newborns should be seen by a pediatric healthcare provider shortly after hospital discharge (three to five days of age). Ideally, newborn visits should be done in-person, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, to evaluate feeding and weight gain, check for dehydration and jaundice, ensure all components of newborn screening were completed with appropriate confirmatory testing and follow-up, and evaluate maternal well-being. All healthcare facilities should ensure infection prevention and control policies are in place to minimize chance of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among providers, patients, and families. For specific recommendations by healthcare facility type and level of community transmission, review Infection Control Guidance for Healthcare Professionals. CDC has additional trainings and information about potential exposures in the workplace for healthcare providers.

Pediatric healthcare providers should incorporate education on everyday infection prevention measures, such as the importance of proper hand hygiene, social distancing, and wearing masks when in public, as well as information on stress and coping during the pandemic in their regular anticipatory guidance with children and their families. Pediatric healthcare providers should educate patients and families about infection prevention policies that exist in clinics, emergency departments, hospitals, and clinics. Remind people to seek emergency care immediately, if indicated, as delaying care may cause harm.

Primary care practices should continue to use infection prevention strategies including:

Scheduling sick visits and well-child visits during different times of the day

Reducing crowding in waiting rooms, by asking patients to remain outside (e.g., stay in their vehicles, if applicable) until they are called into the facility for their appointment, or setting up triage booths to screen patients safely

Considering telemedicine for visits that do not involve vaccination or do not require an in-person physical exam. For more information, visit Using Telehealth Services

What We Can Do,"Community- and faith-based organizations, employers, healthcare systems and providers, public health agencies, policy makers, and others all have a part in helping to promote fair access to health. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, we must work together to ensure that people have resources to maintain and manage their physical and mental health, including easy access to information, affordable testing, and medical care. We need programs and practices that fit the communities where people live, learn, work, play, and worship.

Working Together

The COVID-19 pandemic may change some of the ways we connect and support each other. As individuals and communities respond to COVID-19 recommendations and circumstances (e.g., school closings, workplace closures, social distancing), there are often unintended challenges for important aspects of emotional well-being such as social connectedness and social support. Shared faith, family, and cultural bonds are common sources of social support. Finding ways to maintain support and connection, even when physically apart, can empower and encourage individuals and communities to protect themselves, care for those who become sick, keep kids healthy, and better cope with stress.

Vision

All people have the opportunity to attain the highest level of health possible.

Charge

To reduce the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 among populations at increased risk for infection, severe illness, and death.

To broadly address health disparities and inequities related to COVID-19 with a holistic, all-of-response approach.

To develop a strategic plan to help us realize these goals.

Overview

Achieving health equity requires valuing everyone equally with focused and ongoing efforts to address avoidable inequities, historical and contemporary injustices, and the elimination of health and healthcare disparities. The population health impact of COVID-19 has exposed longstanding inequities that have systematically undermined the physical, social, economic, and emotional health of racial and ethnic minority populations and other population groups that are bearing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19.

Persistent health disparities combined with historic housing patterns, work circumstances, and other factors have put members of some racial and ethnic minority populations at higher risk for COVID-19 infection, severe illness, and death. As we continue to learn more about the impact of COVID-19 on the health of different populations, immediate action is critical to reduce growing COVID-19 disparities among the populations known to be at disproportionate risk.

CDC’s COVID-19 Response Health Equity Strategy broadly seeks to improve the health outcomes of populations disproportionately affected by focusing on four priorities:

Expanding the evidence base. Expanding programs and practices for testing, contact tracing, isolation, healthcare, and recovery from the impact of unintended negative consequences of mitigation strategies in order to reach populations that have been put at increased risk. Examples of potential unintended negative consequences include loss of health insurance; food, housing, and income insecurity; mental health concerns; substance use; and violence resulting from factors like social isolation, financial stress, and anxiety. Expanding program and practice activities to support essential and frontline workers to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Examples of essential and frontline workers include healthcare, food industry, and

correctional facility workers. Expanding an inclusive workforce equipped to assess and address the needs of an increasingly diverse U.S. population.

Populations and Place-Based Focus

Racial and ethnic minority populations

People living in rural or frontier areas

People experiencing homelessness

Essential and frontline workers

People with disabilities

People with substance use disorders

People who are justice-involved (incarcerated persons)

Non-U.S.-born persons

Intended Outcomes

Reduced COVID-19-related health disparities.

Increased testing, contact tracing, isolation options, and preventive care and disease management in populations at increased risk for COVID-19.

Ensured equity in nationwide distribution and administration of future COVID-19 vaccines.

Implemented evidence-based policies, systems, and environmental strategies to mitigate social and health inequities related to COVID-19.

Reduced COVID-19-associated stigma and implicit bias.

Expanded cultural responsiveness and application of health equity principles among an increasingly diverse COVID-19 responder workforce.

Community mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of a new virus with pandemic potential. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus. Community mitigation actions are especially important before a vaccine or therapeutic drug becomes widely available.

Because COVID-19 is highly transmissible and can be spread by people who do not know they have the disease, risk of transmission within a community can be difficult to determine. Until broad-scale testing is widely implemented or we have a more comprehensive and precise measure of disease burden, states and communities should assume some community transmission or spread is occurring.

Individuals need to follow healthy hygiene practices, stay at home when sick, practice physical distancing to lower the risk of disease spread, and use a cloth face covering (with some exceptions) in community settings when physical distancing cannot be maintained. These universal precautions are appropriate regardless of the extent of mitigation needed.

Protecting the public’s health is paramount. As communities work to reduce the spread of COVID-19, they are also addressing the economic, social, and secondary health consequences of the disease. State, local, tribal, and territorial officials are best positioned to determine the level of mitigation required. Mitigation strategies should be feasible, practical, and acceptable; they should be tailored to the needs of each community and implemented in a manner that minimizes both morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and does not create or exacerbate any health disparities.

The information that follows provides a framework for states and localities as they consider which actions to take to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. Selection and implementation of these actions should be guided by the extent of disease transmission (Table 1). Demographic and other community characteristics, as well public health and healthcare system capacity, will also drive decisionmaking on mitigation (Table 2). Finally, a set of possible cross-cutting mitigation strategies for communities to consider is outlined (Table 3). More detailed and updated setting or sector specific mitigation strategies can be found here.

Goals

The goal of community mitigation in areas with local COVID-19 transmission is to slow its spread and to protect all individuals, especially those at increased risk for severe illness, while minimizing the negative impacts of these strategies. These strategies are used to minimize morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in societal sectors such as schools, workplaces, and healthcare organizations.

Implementation is based on:

Emphasizing individual responsibility for implementing recommended personal-level actions

Empowering businesses, schools, and other settings to implement appropriate actions

Prioritizing settings that provide critical infrastructure services

Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible and ensuring access to health care and other essential services.

Interim Recommendations for US Community Facilities with Suspected,"Background

There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is currently known about the virus and about similar coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, but disease transmission via infectious aerosols is currently uncertain. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through objects and surfaces, like doorknobs, countertops, keyboards, toys, etc. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in community settings.

It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air.

Purpose

This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of rooms or areas occupied by those with suspected or with confirmed COVID-19. It is aimed at limiting the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in key environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.

These guidelines are focused on community, non-healthcare facilities such as schools, institutions of higher education, offices, daycare centers, businesses, and community centers that do, and do not, house persons overnight. These guidelines are not meant for cleaning staff in healthcare facilities or repatriation sites, households, or for others for whom specific guidance already exists.

Definitions

Community facilities such as schools, daycare centers, and businesses comprise most non-healthcare settings that are visited by the general public outside of a household.

Cleaning refers to the removal of dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs. But by removing the germs, it decreases their number and therefore any risk of spreading infection.

Disinfecting works by using chemicals, for example EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. But killing germs remaining on a surface after cleaning further reduces any risk of spreading infection.

Cleaning and Disinfection After Persons Suspected/Confirmed to Have COVID-19 Have Been in the Facility

Timing and location of cleaning and disinfection of surfaces

At a school, daycare center, office, or other facility that does not house people overnight:

Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment (like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines) used by the ill persons , focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces .

At a facility that does house people overnight : Follow Interim Guidance for US Institutions of Higher Education on working with state and local health officials to isolate ill persons and provide temporary housing as needed. Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection. In areas where ill persons are being housed in isolation, follow Interim Guidance for Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection for U.S. Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019. This includes focusing on cleaning and disinfecting common areas where staff/others providing services may come into contact with ill persons but reducing cleaning and disinfection of bedrooms/bathrooms used by ill persons to as-needed. In areas where ill persons have visited or used, continue routine cleaning and disinfection as in this guidance.

: If it has been more than 7 days since the person with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.

How to Clean and Disinfect

Hard (non-porous) surfaces

Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.

If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

Always read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use. Wear skin protection and consider eye protection for potential splash hazards

Ensure adequate ventilation

Use no more than the amount recommended on the label

Use water at room temperature for dilution (unless stated otherwise on the label)

Avoid mixing chemical products

Label diluted cleaning solutions

Store and use chemicals out of the reach of children and pets You should never eat, drink, breathe or inject these products into your body or apply directly to your skin as they can cause serious harm. Do not wipe or bathe pets with these products or any other products that are not approved for animal use. See EPA’s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Useexternal icon. Special considerations should be made for people with asthma and they should not be present when cleaning and disinfecting is happening as this can trigger asthma exacerbations. Learn more about reducing asthma triggers.

Disinfect with a household disinfectant on List N: Disinfectants for use against SARs-CoV-2 external icon , the virus that causes COVID 19. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Read the product label for the correct concentration to use, application method, and contact time.

Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted: Use bleach containing 5.25%–8.25% sodium hypochlorite. Do not use a bleach product if the percentage is not in this range or is not specified. Follow the manufacturer’s application instructions for the surface, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute. Ensure proper ventilation during and after application. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. This can cause fumes that may be very dangerous to breathe in.

Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: 5 tablespoons (1/3 rd cup) of 5.25%–8.25% bleach per gallon of room temperature water or 4 teaspoons of 5.25%–8.25% bleach per quart of room temperature water



Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.

Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.

Cleaning staff and others should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.

Always read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use. Keep hand sanitizers away from fire or flame

For children under six years of age, hand sanitizer should be used with adult supervision

Always store hand sanitizer out of reach of children and pets See FDA’s Tips for Safe Sanitizer Useexternal iconexternal icon and CDC's Hand Sanitizer Use Considerations

Follow normal preventive actions while at work and home, including cleaning hands and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Additional key times to clean hands include: After blowing one’s nose, coughing, or sneezing. After using the restroom. Before eating or preparing food. After contact with animals or pets. Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance such as a child.



Soft (porous) surfaces

For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely. Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 external icon and that are suitable for porous surfaces



Electronics

For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines, remove visible contamination if present. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.



L​inens, clothing, and other items that go in the laundry​

In order to minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.

Wash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people’s items.

Clean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry according to guidance above for hard or soft surfaces.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Hand Hygiene

The risk of exposure to cleaning staff is inherently low. Cleaning staff should wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash . Gloves and gowns should be compatible with the disinfectant products being used. Additional PPE might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash. Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area. Be sure to clean hands after removing gloves. If gowns are not available, coveralls, aprons or work uniforms can be worn during cleaning and disinfecting. Reusable (washable) clothing should be laundered afterwards. Clean hands after handling dirty laundry.

. Gloves should be removed after cleaning a room or area occupied by ill persons. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.

Cleaning staff should immediately report breaches in PPE such as a tear in gloves or any other potential exposures to their supervisor.

Cleaning staff and others should clean hands often , including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.

Additional Considerations for Employers",4/30/20 0:00,
COVID-19 Guidance: Businesses and Employers,"Purpose

This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The outbreak first started in China, but the virus continues to spread internationally and in the United States. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other characteristics of COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. Updates are available on CDC’s web page at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/. CDC will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available.

This interim guidance may help prevent workplace exposures to COVID-19 in non-healthcare settings (separate guidance is available for healthcare settings). CDC has also provided guidance for critical infrastructure workers who may have had exposure to a person known or suspected to have COVID-19. Unless otherwise specified, this interim guidance for businesses and employers applies to critical infrastructure workplaces as well.

Role of Businesses and Employers in Responding to COVID-19

Businesses and employers can prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19 within the workplace. Employers should respond in a way that takes into account the level of disease transmission in their communities and revise their business response plans as needed. Employers should follow the White House Guidelines for Opening Up America Againexternal icon, a phased approach based on current levels of transmission and healthcare capacity at the state or local level, as part of resuming business operations. Business operation decisions should be based on both the level of disease transmission in the community and your readiness to protect the safety and health of your employees and customers.

Businesses and employers are encouraged to coordinate with stateexternal icon and localexternal icon health officials to obtain timely and accurate information to inform appropriate responses. Local conditions will influence the decisions that public health officials make regarding community-level strategies. CDC has guidance for mitigation strategiespdf icon according to the level of community transmission or impact of COVID-19.

As an employer, if your business operations were interrupted, resuming normal or phased activities presents an opportunity to update your COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plans. All employers should implement and update as necessary a plan that:

Is specific to your workplace,

identifies all areas and job tasks with potential exposures to COVID-19, and

includes control measures to eliminate or reduce such exposures.

Talk with your employees about planned changes and seek their input. Additionally, collaborate with employees and unions to effectively communicate important COVID-19 information.

See the OSHA COVID-19 guidancepdf iconexternal icon for more information on how to protect workers from potential exposures, according to their exposure risk. Plans should consider that employees may be able to spread COVID-19 even if they do not show symptoms.

All employers need to consider how best to decrease the spread of COVID-19 and lower the impact in your workplace. This should include activities to:",2/11/20 0:00,
SARS-CoV-2 Testing Strategy: Considerations for Non-Healthcare Workplaces,"Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide employers with strategies for consideration of incorporating testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into a workplace COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plan.

Employers are encouraged to collaborate with state, territorial, tribal and local health officials to determine whether and how to implement the following testing strategies and which one(s) would be most appropriate for their circumstances. These considerations are meant to supplement, not replace, any federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which workplaces must comply. These strategies should be carried out in a manner consistent with law and regulation, including laws protecting employee privacy and confidentiality. They should also be carried out consistent with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidance regarding permissible testing policies and procedures. Employers paying for testing of employees should put procedures in place for rapid notification of results and establish appropriate measures based on testing results including instructions regarding self-isolation and restrictions on workplace access.

Considerations for use of a strategy to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection

SARS-CoV-2 testing may be incorporated as part of a comprehensive approach to reducing transmission in non-healthcare workplaces. Symptom screening, testing, and contact tracing pdf icon[58 pages] are strategies to identify workers infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so that actions can be taken to slow and stop the spread of the virus.

Employees undergoing testing should receive clear information on:

the manufacturer and name of the test, the type of test, the purpose of the test, the reliability of the test, any limitations associated with the test, who will pay for the test, and how the test will be performed, and

how to understand what the results mean, actions associated with negative or positive results, who will receive the results, how the results may be used, and any consequences for declining to be tested.

Individuals tested are required to receive patient fact sheets as part of the test’s emergency use authorizationexternal icon.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued interim guidanceexternal icon for enforcing the requirements of 29 CFR Part 1904external icon with respect to the recording of occupational illnesses, specifically cases of COVID-19. Under OSHA’s recordkeeping requirements, COVID-19 is a recordable illness, and thus employers are responsible for recording cases of COVID-19, if the case meets certain requirements. Employers are encouraged to frequently check OSHA’s webpage at www.osha.gov/coronavirusexternal icon for updates.

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection

Viral tests approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are used to diagnose current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Viral tests evaluate whether the virus is present in respiratory or other samples. Results from these tests help public health officials identify and isolate people who are infected in order to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Antibody tests approved or authorized by the FDA are used to detect past infection with SARS-CoV-2. CDC does not currently recommend using antibody testing as the sole basis for diagnosing current infection. Depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it is currently not known whether a positive antibody test indicates immunity against SARS-CoV-2; therefore, antibody tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune.

Categories for SARS-CoV-2 testing

CDC describes strategies for SARS-CoV-2 viral testing for five categories of people:

Testing individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19

Employers may consider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) to identify employees with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 before they enter a facility, in accordance with CDC’s General Business FAQs. Employers should follow guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionexternal icon regarding confidentiality of medical records from health checks.

Workers with COVID-19 symptoms should be immediately separated from other employees, customers, and visitors, and sent home or to a healthcare facility, depending on how severe their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for oneself. To prevent stigma and discrimination in the workplace, make employee health screenings as private as possible. Consistent with CDC’s recommendations, workers with COVID-19 symptoms should be referred to a healthcare provider for evaluation and potential testing. Waiting for test results prior to returning to work is preferred to keep potentially infected workers out of the workplace.

Employers are encouraged to implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices as part of a comprehensive approach to prevent and reduce transmission among employees. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA or Act) requires certain employersexternal icon to provide their employees with paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19. Employers with fewer than 500 employees are eligible for 100% tax creditsexternal icon for Families First Coronavirus Response Act COVID-19 paid leave provided through December 31, 2020, up to certain limits.

Positive test results using a viral test indicate that the employee has COVID-19 and should not come to work and should isolate at home. Decisions to discontinue home isolation for workers with COVID-19 and allow them to return to work may follow either a symptom-based, time based, or a test-based strategy (see Testing to determine resolution of infection below).

Testing asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission

Case investigation is typically initiated when a health department receives a report from a laboratory of a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test result or a report from a healthcare provider of a patient with a confirmed or probable diagnosis of COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon .

Viral testing may be recommended for close contacts (people who have been within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more) of persons with COVID-19 in jurisdictions with testing capacity. Because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it is important that individuals exposed to people with known or suspected COVID-19 be quickly identified and quarantined. Viral testing can detect if these individuals are currently infected. The health department may reach out to the employer for assistance in identifying close contacts of the worker as well as possible contacts. Employers are encouraged to work with public health departments investigating cases of COVID-19 and tracing contacts to help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in their workplaces and communities.

Because there may be a delay between the time a person is exposed to the virus and the time that virus can be detected by testing, early testing after exposure at a single time point may miss many infections1. Testing that is repeated at different points in time, also referred to as serial testing, may be more likely to detect infection among close contacts of a COVID-19 case than testing done at a single point in time.

Even if close contacts are monitored with serial testing, it is critical that they strictly adhere to other preventive measures including social distancing, wearing cloth face coverings for source control if the hazard assessment has determined that they do not require personal protective equipment such as a respirator or medical facemask for protection, and practicing hand hygiene.

Testing may also be considered for possible close contacts of persons diagnosed with COVID-19 in collaboration with the local health department if resources permit. A risk-based approach to testing possible contacts of a person with confirmed COVID-19 may be applied. Such an approach should take into consideration the likelihood of exposure, which is affected by the characteristics of the workplace and the results of contact investigations. In some settings, broader testing (i.e., testing beyond individually identified close contacts to those who are possible close contacts), such as targeting workers who worked in the same area and during the same shift, may be considered as part of a strategy to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace. The rationale is that identification of contacts may be imprecise. High-risk settings that have demonstrated potential for rapid and widespread dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 include:

High-density critical infrastructure workplaces

Workplaces where employees live in congregate settings (e.g., fishing vessels, offshore oil platforms, farmworker housing or wildland firefighter camps)

Workplaces with populations at risk for severe illness if they are infected, such as nursing homes

Employers are encouraged to consult with state, local, territorial, and tribal health departments to help inform decision-making about broad-based testing.

If employees are tested after close contact or possible close contact with someone who has a confirmed or probable diagnosis of COVID-19, care should be taken to inform these employees of their possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace while maintaining confidentiality of the individual with COVID-19, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Actexternal icon (ADA) and consistent with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidance regarding What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Lawsexternal icon.

Testing asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification in special settings

Viral testing of workers without symptoms may be useful to detect COVID-19 early and stop transmission quickly, particularly in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission. When communities experience moderate to substantial transmission, workplace settings for which these approaches may be considered include:

Workplaces where physical distancing is difficult and workers are in close contact with co-workers or the public

Workplaces in remote settings where medical evaluation or treatment may be delayed

Workplaces where continuity of operations is a high priority (e.g., critical infrastructure sectors external icon )

) Workplaces providing congregate housing for employees (e.g. fishing vessels, offshore oil platforms, farmworker housing or wildland firefighter camps)

Approaches may include initial testing of all workers before entering a workplace, periodic testing of workers at regular intervals, and/or targeted testing of new workers or those returning from a prolonged absence. Several factors may be helpful in determining the interval for periodic testing including:

The availability of testing

The latency between exposure and development of a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test

Businesses that fall into one of the workplace categories described above

The rate or change in rate of people getting infected in the surrounding community

How many employees tested positive during previous rounds of testing

Your relevant experience with workplace outbreaks

State, local, territorial, and tribal health departments may be able to provide assistance on any local context or guidance impacting the workplace. Before testing a large proportion of asymptomatic workers without known or suspected exposure, employers are encouraged to have a plan in place for how they will modify operations based on test results and manage a higher risk of false positive results in a low prevalence population.

Testing to determine resolution of infection

The decision to end home isolation and return to work for employees with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should be made in the context of clinical and local circumstances. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification tests have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in some people’s respiratory samples after they have recovered from COVID-19. Prolonged viral shedding has been demonstrated without direct evidence for virus capable of replicating or causing infection. Consequently, in most cases, evidence supports a symptom-based strategy to determine when to discontinue home isolation or precautions. For persons who are severely immunocompromised, a test-based strategy could be considered in consultation with infectious diseases experts. For all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or precautions earlier than would occur under the symptom-based strategy.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, employers are permitted to require a healthcare provider’s noteexternal icon to verify that employees are healthy and able to return to work. However, as a practical matter, employers should be aware that healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy during periods of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and may not be able to provide such documentation in a timely manner. In such cases, employers should consider not requiring a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness, can recover at home without medical care, and can follow CDC recommendations to determine when to discontinue home isolation and return to work.

Public health surveillance for SARS-CoV-2

Testing is considered to be surveillance when conducted to detect transmission hot spots, or to better understand disease trends in a workplace. These goals are consistent with employer-based occupational medicine surveillance programs. Occupational medicine surveillance programs may use testing to assess the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in the workforce, assess factors that place employees at risk for workplace acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, or evaluate the effectiveness of workplace infection control programs. Surveillance should only be undertaken if the results have a reasonable likelihood of benefiting workers.

Considerations for Outdoor Farmers Markets,"Farmers market managers should consider the recommendations below to help ensure safe access to food while helping prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges to food security in the United States. Access to healthy food options and nutrition are an important part of overall physical and mental health. Across the United States, farmers markets have been named an essential service because of their role in supporting local farms and providing communities access to fresh, healthy food during the pandemic. Outdoor farmers markets provide a lower risk shopping option with immediate and lasting benefits for shoppers and the community at-large.

These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations that organizations must follow. Farmers market managers should collaborate with state and local health officials to determine whether to implement these considerations as-is or tailor them to their community’s needs. Farmers market managers should continue monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in the community they serve and have a plan in place to adjust their operations as needed.

Farmers market managers may also benefit from reviewing CDC’s COVID-19 guidance and considerations on community based organizations, workplaces, events and gatherings, and food service providers. Farmers market managers should consider CDC’s information on people at higher risk of severe illness .

Slowing the spread of COVID-19

Coronaviruses, such as the one that causes COVID-19, are thought to spread mostly from person to person through respiratory droplets emitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The droplets containing virus are spread in the air and can be inhaled in the lungs or land on the mouth, nose or eyes of people nearby. A person also might be exposed to the virus causing COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, including food or food packaging, that has been contaminated with the virus when an infected person coughs or sneezes near it, and then touches their own mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Risk of transmission from food, food packaging, and shopping bags is considered very low, but there are other, possible routes of COVID-19 transmission, such as:

Being in close contact (within 6 feet) with people you don’t live with, especially people who are not wearing a mask. The more people you interact with, and the longer those interactions last, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread;

Touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your own mouth, nose, or eyes.

Outdoor activities generally are lower risk than indoor activities but there are still important ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 that should be followed:

Promote healthy behaviors

Encourage people to stay home when sick.

Staff, volunteers, and vendors should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms , or have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of, or diagnosed with, COVID-19.

or have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of, or diagnosed with, COVID-19. Educate staff, volunteers, and vendors about when they should stay home and when it is safe to be around others .

Actively encourage customers using signage, social media, or other communication platforms that your market commonly uses, to stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms , or have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of, or diagnosed with, COVID-19.

Encourage people to socially distance.

Staying at least six feet apart from others, even when you are outside, reduces the chance that you will be exposed to the virus from respiratory droplets emitted by others.

Many people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or no symptoms, but they can still spread the virus to others. Staying apart reduces your risk of getting COVID-19.

Social distancing is most effective when it is used along with other prevention strategies, including wearing masks.

Masks

Require staff, volunteers, and vendors to use masks. Masks are an important means of reducing viral spread and are essential during times when social distancing is difficult. Provide information to all staff and volunteers on proper use and washing of masks.

If feasible, provide masks for staff, volunteers, and vendors and consider asking them to bring extra masks, in case their mask gets wet or soiled, as well as a sealable plastic bag or other container to store masks when not in use.

Encourage customers to bring and use masks. If feasible, provide masks for those who may not have one.

Hand hygiene

Provide handwashing stations or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol for all, including customers, market staff, volunteers, and vendors, and encourage vendors to offer the same at their booth.

Proper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure. Ensure vendors, market staff, and volunteers wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available or accessible, provide an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Key times to clean hands in general include: Before, during, and after preparing or handling food Before eating food After using the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing After touching frequently touched surfaces After putting on, touching, or removing masks

Additional workplace-specific times to clean hands include: Before and after work shifts and periodically throughout shift Before and after work breaks After touching money or objects that have been handled by customers, such as produce, other market food, and reusable grocery bags Before putting on and taking off disposable gloves After taking out the trash



Clear signage and communications

Ensure that all staff, volunteers, vendors, and customers are aware of market policies and procedures. Signs with market hours of operation and safety precautions should be posted at each entrance/exit and near shared areas.

Maintain healthy environments

Consider modifications you can make to promote social distancing, including:

Providing different ways for ordering and pick-up to reduce the number of in-person interactions (e.g., curbside box pickup). Set up designated pick-up areas.

Where possible, redesigning market layouts to increase the distance between customers in line and walking throughout the market (e.g., increase space between vendor booths; create one-way traffic flow). Ensure that market layout modifications are accessible for all persons (e.g., ADA-compliant paths).

Limiting the number of customers to reduce crowding and lines to meet social distancing guidelines.

Installing physical barriers like sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., vendor booths).

Posting clear and prominent directional and physical distancing signage for all walkways, entry and exit ways, vendor booths, and spaces that can easily become crowded (e.g., customers waiting in line).

Safe operations include:

Being aware of local and state regulatory agency policies related to providing essential services and group gatherings to determine if your market can be held, and if there are restrictions limiting the number of attendees or vendors.

Limiting market activities that target individuals identified as higher risk for serious illness for COVID-19, if feasible. If these events or activities continue to be offered, consider creating a schedule that includes special shopping hours for at-risk or vulnerable populations (e.g., senior shopping hours).

Where feasible, implementing cashless payment systems and continue to accept SNAP EBT. If your market traditionally uses hard to-clean vouchers (e.g., wooden tokens) for SNAP EBT transactions or other incentives, consider alternatives.

When exchanging paper and coin money Do not touch your face afterwards. Ask customers to place cash on the table or directly in a cashbox, rather than directly into your hand. Place money directly on the table when providing change back to customers. Wipe the table between each customer at checkout.

Avoiding using cloth table coverings or other hard to clean table covers.

If possible, vendor booths should have a designated person for handling cash/tokens and another for handling food or food products.

Limiting or suspending taste testing, cooking demonstrations, and/or other food sampling activities.

If your market offers prepared food for immediate consumption, consider limiting to take-out orders only.

Consider limiting or suspending non-essential market services or events like live music.

Discouraging customers from touching items they do not plan to purchase.

Consider regular symptom screenings of staff, vendors or others that come onsite, and have a plan for if anyone arrives or becomes ill. For guidance related to screening of staff, please refer to CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the “Prevent Transmission Among Employees” section of CDC’s Resuming Business Toolkit pdf icon .

. Train staff, volunteers, and vendors on new COVID-19 procedures. If possible, conduct training virtually so all can attend, and no crowds will gather.

Require staff, volunteers, and vendors to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water (or use hand sanitizer) frequently before, during, and after shifts.

Consider asking vendors to pre-bag or pre-portion items for sale prior to market.

Staggering eating/break times and identify a designated area for staff and volunteers to take breaks where social distancing can be maintained.

Discouraging customers and vendors from bringing pets except — service animals — to the market.

Cleaning and disinfection

Follow CDC and EPA’s Guidance on Cleaning and Disinfection to prepare and maintain a safe environment for your market workforce, volunteers, vendors and customers. Use EPA-approved disinfectants against the virus that causes COVID-19pdf icon. Always read and follow label instructions for each product.

Routinely clean, sanitize, and disinfect payment devices, tables, and other high touch surfaces and objects. Require participating market vendors to do the same.

If you have restrooms or port-a-potties, set up a schedule to frequently clean and disinfect all surfaces, and replenish soap, sanitizers, or paper products.

Limit or suspend the use of items that are hard to clean and disinfect (e.g., wooden tokens).

Use disposable gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash: After using disposable gloves, throw them out in a lined trash can. Do not disinfect or reuse the gloves. Wash hands after removing gloves.

Ensure you have enough supplies for market workforce, volunteers, and customers to clean their hands and cover their coughs and sneezes. Supplies include soap, water, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, a way to dry hands, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch trash cans.

Conserving Filtering Facepiece Respirator Supply,"Audience: This guidance is intended for use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency by federal, state, and local public health officials, respiratory protection program managers, leaders in occupational health services and industrial hygiene programs, and other leaders who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing occupational exposures in non-healthcare worksites.

Purpose: This document offers strategies to conserve, extend, and respond to shortages in the supply of NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) used in non-healthcare worksites such as manufacturing and construction. NIOSH-approved FFRs protect users by filtering particles out of the air the user is breathing and include several classes of filters, including N95s.

The following strategies apply the principles of the hierarchy of controls and are intended to assist employers in selecting strategies to control workplace exposures during times of known supply shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies 1 and 2 reinforce employer requirements for the continuous evaluation and implementation of traditional hazard control practices such as elimination, substitution, engineering and administration controls. Other strategies described herein include certain allowances such as use of FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life to be incorporated into practice only during times of supply shortages during the COVID-19 public health emergency.

A secondary purpose is to reduce the demand for FFRs in general industry settings during the COVID-19 response so that (1) FFR manufacturers and distributors can maximize supplies to healthcare settings and (2) general industry worksites can evaluate if any excess inventories they may hold are suitable for redistributing (e.g., selling, donating) to healthcare settings. Employers should consider redistribution of excess inventories only if adequate exposure controls for their workers are implemented. For guidance to prevent workplace exposures to acute respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, please see CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers.

Background

The expanding outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States has created an overwhelming demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), including NIOSH-approved FFRs, in healthcare facilities across the country. Additionally, the supply chains of PPE from manufacturing countries have been substantially disrupted due to local COVID-19 spread and demand. Because of this increase in demand and decrease in supply, CDC has provided guidance to healthcare settings for strategies to optimize their supply of N95 respirators. This guidance describes surge capacity for healthcare facilities providing care in conventional, contingency, and crisis situations. The decisions to implement measures for healthcare facilities in contingency and crisis situations are based, in part, on the availability of N95 respirators, specifically, and other types of respirators, in general.

In recognition of the demand for FFRs in the healthcare setting and the priority to protect healthcare workers who are the workers at highest risk for COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued two emergency use authorizationsexternal icon to allow FFRs not typically worn in healthcare settings to be worn. This may reduce the availability of these FFRs for other worksites.

Users of NIOSH-approved FFRs in non-healthcare settings should develop and implement strategies to conserve and extend their current stock of respirator supplies while protecting their workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employers should implement alternative controls to reduce, as much as possible, their reliance on PPE, particularly FFRs. Conventionally, a hierarchy of controls has been used to provide feasible and effective controls to protect workers. Multiple control strategies can be implemented concurrently and/or sequentially. This hierarchy can be described as follows:

Elimination

Substitution

Engineering controls

Administrative controls

Personal protective equipment (PPE)

Elimination and Substitution

Employers should evaluate work tasks and processes to identify those activities or processes where the elimination or substitution of hazards may be implemented. While the most effective at controlling hazards, these may be the most difficult to implement in existing processes, particularly during times of national or local emergencies.

Engineering Controls

Engineering controls reduce workers’ exposures by placing a barrier between the hazard and the worker or removing the hazard at the source. While the initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than the cost of administrative controls or PPE, engineering controls generally provide a cost savings over the longer term and can eliminate the need for respirators if properly designed, implemented, and maintained. Examples for consideration includes:

Local exhaust ventilation

Wet methods (when water is sprayed on a dusty surface or when a material is mixed with water to prevent aerosolization)

Glove boxes, cabinets, or other enclosures for isolation of the hazard

Administrative Controls

Administrative controls are used with existing processes to limit or prevent a hazard by changing the way people work. Examples include:

Job rotation in which workers change job tasks or areas to reduce their exposures and the need to be in respiratory protection

Establishing policies and implementing procedures limiting the amount of time that an individual worker can work on a specific job task or in areas with high exposures

Training workers on the hazards and controls available to reduce exposures

Installing warning labels and signs to remind workers to stay away from hazardous job tasks or areas

Personal Protective Equipment

While engineering and administrative controls should be considered first when implementing controls, PPE can be part of a suite of strategies used to protect workers. PPE includes respirators, protective gloves, protective eyewear and face shields, and a variety of other protective gear. PPE is frequently used with existing processes where hazards are not particularly well-controlled. This method for protecting workers is typically less effective than other measures due to the reliance on the user to put on, use, and take off the PPE correctly and the potential for PPE breaches. Additionally, proper use of respiratory protection requires a comprehensive program (including medical clearance, training, and fit testing) that complies with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection Standardexternal icon.

Recommendations

In times of high demand and low supply of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic, non-healthcare sector employers should evaluate current work practices and control strategies to create a strategic exposure prevention and control plan to continue to protect workers. As part of such a plan, strategies for employers to consider are prioritized below. These measures are recommended to conserve and extend their FFR supply and to respond to shortages of manufacturer-supplied FFRs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has also provided guidanceexternal icon on many of these measures related to their enforcement of the Respiratory Protection Standard, 29 CFR 1910.134external icon, and certain other health standards, with regard to supply shortages of disposable N95 FFRs.

The following measures emphasize engineering and administrative controls to implement for exposure prevention and control plans and to reduce reliance on FFRs

Evaluate and execute long-term strategies for the elimination and substitution of hazards and the implementation of engineering controls for processes in which FFRs are currently required. NIOSH engineering control strategies are outlined for a variety of industries and hazards online Industry- and process-specific control strategies are detailed by the British Health and Safety Executive as a part of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Essentials external icon and are available online Implement immediately feasible engineering and administrative controls to eliminate or minimize exposures for which employers are currently requiring the use of FFRs. These controls should be routinely evaluated to ensure they continue to control exposures to acceptable levels and include: Moving work to inside ventilated enclosures such as fume hoods and biological safety cabinets. Modifying the processes to reduce exposures, such as putting dry materials into a wet slurry to reduce the potential for exposure. Postponing non-essential work requiring the use of FFRs. Limiting the number of workers needing respirators to the minimum required to safely complete the task. Arranging work/production schedules to reduce the number of respirators needed.

The following measures may require changes in daily standard respiratory protection practices but may not have significant impact and may be used temporarily during periods of expected FFR shortages

Use qualitative methods to fit test workers for FFRs external icon . Quantitative fit test methods require consuming FFRs during the fit test, while qualitative do not. As such, qualitative fit testing methods would conserve FFRs to be used for controlling workplace exposures. Transition respiratory protection programs to use NIOSH-approved alternatives to FFRs, where feasible. NIOSH maintains a searchable, online version of the certified equipment list identifying all NIOSH-approved respirators. Alternatives to FFRs, in order of preference to implement at non-healthcare worksites in order to preserve as many N95s as possible for healthcare settings, include: Elastomeric half facepiece air-purifying respirators: tight-fitting respirators that are made of synthetic or rubber material permitting them to be repeatedly disinfected, cleaned, and reused. They are equipped with exchangeable filter cartridges. Elastomeric full facepiece air-purifying respirators: Like the elastomeric half facepiece respirator, the elastomeric full facepiece respirator is a reusable device that uses exchangeable filter cartridges but has a clear plastic lens that covers the face and provides eye protection. Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs): reusable respirators that typically have loose-fitting hoods or helmets. These respirators are battery-powered with a blower that pulls air through attached filters or cartridges. The filter is typically a high efficiency (HE) filter. Loose-fitting PAPRs do not require fit testing and can be worn by people with facial hair. When non-PPE controls cannot feasibly be implemented and when no alternative respirators to FFRs can be obtained, conserve current FFR supplies on-hand by extending the employer’s schedule for when they are disposed and replaced. For companies with policies allowing the regular disposal and replacement of N95s and other FFRs, extended use of these FFRs beyond normal change-out schedules, when acceptable, can also be considered. The decision to implement policies that permit extended use of FFRs should be made by the professionals who manage the institution’s respiratory protection program. Criteria for disposing and replacing FFRs include when breathing through the filter material becomes too restricted rather than simply disposing of them on a regularly scheduled basis such as after a single shift. In such cases, proper training on storage of used respirators is required. Use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training and fit testing. In times of shortage, you may be able to use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training and fit testing purposes. However, expired respirators might not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the strap and filter material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Using such respirators for training and fit testing would allow non-expired N95 FFRs to be used for normal work operations. Use respirators approved under standards used in other countries that are similar to NIOSH-approved FFRs. (See Table 1.) Within Table 1, the country, conformity assessment standards, standards and guidance documents, acceptable product classification, and NIOSH classification are provided in alphabetical order. All of these respirators have protection factors of at least 10 in the countries listed in the table, as outlined in the standards and guidance documents specified. NIOSH has confidence that devices supplied by current NIOSH-approval holders producing respirators under the various standards authorized in other countries are expected to provide the protection indicated, given that a proper fit is achieved. Non-NIOSH-approved products developed by manufacturers who are not NIOSH approval holders, including those approved by and received from China, should only be used in crisis situations when no other NIOSH-approved N95 respirator or a listed device from one of the other recognized countries is available. To ensure this level of confidence, NIOSH has developed an assessment to evaluate the filter efficiency of respirators from other countries. NIOSH is happy to conduct the testing for you and provide you the results of the testing. The webpages to request respirator assessments are available.

The following measures may need to be considered during periods of known respirator shortages

Use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for work operations. Consideration can be made to use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for work operations when no other controls or respiratory protection are available. Respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life may not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the straps and nose bridge material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Many models found in U.S. stockpiles have been found to continue to perform in accordance with NIOSH performance standards. Users should take the following precautionary measures prior to using the respirator in the workplace. Visually inspect the FFR to determine if its integrity has been compromised. Check that components such as the straps, nose bridge, and nose foam material did not degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal and therefore the effectiveness of the respirator. If the integrity of any part of the respirator is compromised, discard the respirator and try another respirator. Users should perform a user seal check immediately after they don each respirator and should not use a respirator on which they cannot perform a successful user seal check.

When the above control steps are not feasible, FFR and higher levels of respiratory protection are unavailable, and alternative respiratory protection strategies are not possible, it is recommended that work activities requiring such protection be suspended.

Evaluating N95 FFR Inventories Held by General Industry for Transfer to Healthcare Settings

Employers who successfully implement strategies for conserving and extending their FFR supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic may find that they possess excess inventories. It is recommended that employers consider redistributing (e.g., selling, donating) available excess inventories to healthcare settings during the COVID-19 pandemic to help reduce known shortages of respirators. Worksites that are no longer active due to emergency work stoppages and restrictions are encouraged to consider redistributing their excess PPE and fit test kits to their state medical countermeasure contacts, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)external icon, or through other appropriate channels. Non-healthcare employers who bought large quantities of respirators in the months preceding the crisis should consider if they are willing to redistribute (e.g., sell, donate) those respirators for healthcare use.

CDC Interim Guidance for Critical Infrastructure Workers Exposed to COVID-19

CDC’s critical infrastructure guidance provides exceptions to current home quarantine practices after an exposure to COVID-19. The guidance advises that employers may permit workers who have had an exposure to COVID-19, but who do not have symptoms, to continue to work, provided they adhere to additional safety precautions, such as measuring the employee’s temperature and assessing for symptoms of COVID-19 before each work shift (“pre-screening”), asking the employee to self-monitor for symptoms during their work shift, and wearing a cloth face covering. While this guidance is designed to ensure that work in critical infrastructure sectors can continue, critical infrastructure employers have an obligation to manage the continuation of work in a way that best protects the health of their workers and the general public.

When following the CDC interim guidance, consider adapting your COVID-19 business response plan with the following elements:

Maintain healthy business operations

Reintegrating exposed, asymptomatic workers to onsite operations, while discussed in the critical infrastructure guidance, should not be misinterpreted as always being the first or most appropriate option to pursue in managing critical work tasks. Home isolation may still be the most preferred and viable option for exposed workers.

Minimize the number of workers present at worksites, balancing the need to protect workers with support for continuing critical operations.

Anticipate and monitor staff absences due to illness or exposure by: Identifying and prioritizing job functions essential for continuous operation, Cross-training employees to perform critical job functions so the workplace can operate even if key employees are absent, and Matching critical job functions with other equally skilled and available workers who have not experienced an exposure to COVID-19.

Consider special accommodations (e.g., telework, reassignment of duties to minimize contact with others) for employees who are members of a vulnerable population.

Reduce transmission among employees and the public

Actively encourage sick employees to stay home.

Immediately send any employee who becomes sick during the day home or to seek further care from a healthcare provider.

Have sick employees follow CDC-recommended guidance. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.

Pre-screen employees (e.g., measuring the employee’s temperature and assessing symptoms of COVID-19 prior to starting work) and perform regular medical monitoring (e.g., the employee should self-monitor for symptoms or follow up with the employer’s occupational health program) of exposed workers. Consult with an occupational health provider and state and/or local health officials to ensure that medical monitoring is conducted appropriately.

Ensure exposed workers wear a facemask or cloth face covering in accordance with CDC and OSHA guidance and any state or local requirements.

Implement social distancing to minimize the chances of workers exposing one another.

Educate employees about how they can reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Testing Strategy for Coronavirus (COVID-19) in High-Density Critical Infrastructure Workplaces after a COVID-19 Case Is Identified,"Summary of Changes Revisions made on October 21, 2020 Added links to the updated close contact definition.

Updated language to align with updated definition.

Workers in critical infrastructure sectors may be permitted to work if asymptomatic after potential exposure to a confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), provided that worker infection prevention recommendations and controls are implemented. Outbreaks of illness among workers in food-producing facilities and surrounding communities have raised unique questions that identified the need for testing for COVID-19 to supplement existing guidance. This document presents different testing strategy options for exposed co-workers when public health organizations and employers determine testing is needed to help support existing disease control measures. Such strategies can aid in identifying infectious individuals with the goal of reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace. These strategies augment and do not replace existing guidance.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is primarily spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Workers in high-density settings in which workers are in the workplace for long time periods (e.g., for 8-12 hours per shift), and have prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for 15 minutes or more) with coworkers may be at increased risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2. A close contact is defined in existing Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure. Other distinctive factors that may increase risk for transmission among these workers include: sharing transportation such as ride-share vans or shuttle vehicles, car-pools, and public transportation; frequent contact with fellow workers in community settings in areas where there is ongoing community transmission; and shared or congregate housing such as dormitories. Workers include, but are not limited to, all employees, contractors, and others who perform work at the facility or worksite. Early experience from COVID-19 outbreaks in a variety of settings suggests that when symptomatic workers with COVID-19 are identified, there are often asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic workers with SARS-CoV-2 present at the workplace. Testing is important to identify such individuals, as they may not know they are infected. SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic persons can result in additional cases and potentially outbreaks of COVID-19. Implementing screening for symptoms of COVID-19, testing, and contact tracingpdf icon may be used to detect infected workers earlier and exclude them from the workplace, thus preventing disease transmission and subsequent outbreaks.[1–3]

Critical infrastructure employers have an obligation to manage the continuation of work in a way that best protects the health of their workers and the general public. Appropriate workplace protections, such as engineering and administrative controls, for those present in the workplace should remain in place. Examples of these controls can be found in existing guidance for Meat and Poultry Processing Workers and Employers, and for Manufacturing Workers and Employers and other critical infrastructure guidancepdf iconexternal icon. Screening1 workers and others entering the workplace for symptoms of COVID-19 and body temperature is a critical component of preventing transmission and protecting workers. Workplaces should review and follow existing guidance. Workers who are symptomatic upon arrival at work, or who become sick during the day, should immediately be separated from others. They should be sent to their home or a health care facility, as appropriate, and referred for further evaluation and testing in consultation with the state, territorial, or local health departments or through occupational health providers.

After a COVID-19 case is identified, testing strategies of exposed co-workers may be considered to help prevent disease spread, to identify the scope and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to inform additional prevention and control efforts that might be needed.

Viral (nucleic acid or antigen) testing should be used to diagnose acute infection.

Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: (1) viral tests to detect current infections, and (2) antibody tests to identify previous infections. CDC provides an overview of categories of people for SARS-CoV-2 testing with viral tests (i.e., nucleic acid or antigen tests). Viral testing can be used to inform actions necessary to keep SARS-CoV-2 out of the workplace, detect COVID-19 cases quickly, and stop transmission. Testing practices should aim for rapid turnaround times in order to facilitate effective action. Viral testing detects infection at the time the sample is collected; very early infection at the time of sample collection or exposure (e.g., workplace or community) after sample collection can result in undetected infection. Testing at different points in time, also referred to as serial testing, may be more likely to detect acute infection among workers with repeat exposures than testing done at a single point in time.

At the current time, antibody test results should not be used to diagnose someone with an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Refer to the CDC website for additional information regarding testing for COVID-19 and specimen collection.

Considerations for use of a testing strategy for COVID-19 infection:

What Workers and Employers Can Do to Manage Workplace Fatigue during COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has touched all aspects of society including how we work. Emergency responders, health care workers, and others providing essential services to the community have been especially stretched thin, working longer hours than usual, working more shifts or even over-night, and leaving less time to sleep and recharge.

Under regular circumstances, adults need 7–9 hours of sleep per night, along with opportunities for rest while awake, optimal health, and well-being. Long work hours and shift work, combined with stressful or physically demanding work, can lead to poor sleep and extreme fatigue. Fatigue increases the risk for injury and deteriorating health (infections, illnesses, and mental health disorders).

While there is no one solution to fit everyone’s needs, here are some general strategies that workers and employers can use to manage workplace fatigue and work safely.",2/11/20 0:00,
COVID-19 - School Reopening: Indicators to Inform Decision Making,"It is critical for schools to open as safely and as quickly as possible for in-person learning. To enable schools to open and remain open, it is important to adopt and correctly and consistently implement actions to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, not only inside the school, but also in the community. This means that students, families, teachers, school staff, and all community members should take actions to protect themselves and others where they live, work, learn, and play. In short, success in preventing the introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools is connected to and dependent upon preventing transmission in communities.

Background

Schools are an important part of the infrastructure of communities, as they provide safe, supportive learning environments for students, employ teachers and other staff, and enable parents, guardians, and caregivers to work. Schools also help to mitigate health disparities by providing critical services including school meal programs and social, physical, behavioral, and mental health services. SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools may be a reflection of transmission in the surrounding community. Therefore, when making decisions on when to open schools for in-person learning it is important to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the surrounding community to determine the possible risk of introduction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the school.

International and domestic experiences have demonstrated that even when a school carefully coordinates, plans, and prepares for reopening, cases of COVID-19 may still occur. Expecting and planning for the occurrence of one or more cases of COVID-19 in schools can help respond immediately to mitigate the impact to allow the school to remain open for in-person learning, if appropriate. When mitigation strategies are consistently and correctly used, the risk of spread within the school environment and the surrounding community is decreased.

Purpose of indicators

During the COVID-19 pandemic, States, Tribes, Localities, Territories (STLT) and school districts have been making decisions about when and how to safely open schools. Many STLTs, partners, and members of the public have asked CDC how to determine when it is safe to open schools for in-person learning. There is no easy answer or single indicator. Many variables must be considered.

This document proposes core and secondary indicators that STLTs can use to aid in their decision-making process regarding school reopening for in-person learning. In-person learning includes all classes and activities conducted during core school hours. It does not explicitly include extracurricular activities — like sports or theater — conducted after school hours. However, these indicators could also be used to determine whether and how to implement extracurricular activities with the necessary mitigation strategies in place.

This document is meant to assist STLT officials in making decisions rather than establishing regulatory requirements. Recommendations are based on CDC’s current knowledge of COVID-19 in the United States. CDC will continue to monitor COVID-19 activity and update guidance as needed. This guidance is meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which schools must comply.

Each STLT should decide the most appropriate indicators to reference when deciding to open, close, or reopen schools. CDC recommends the use of 3 core indicators. These core indicators include two measures of community burden (number of new cases per 100,000 persons in the past 14 days; and percentage of RT-PCR tests that are positive during the last 14 days) AND one self-assessed measure of school implementation of key mitigation strategies. CDC suggests decision-makers use one or both of the first core measures of community burden in addition to a third core indicator, the self-assessed measure of school implementation of key mitigation strategies. These key mitigation strategies should be implemented to the largest extent possible.

The two measures of community burden should be used to assess the incidence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the surrounding community (e.g., county) and not in the schools themselves. Currently, CDC does not recommend using these core indicators as measures of burden within the school.

Secondary indicators may also be used to complement the core indicators and further support actions taken. The list of secondary indicators is illustrative and is not meant to be exhaustive.

Other factors should also be considered in local decision-making – including the extent to which mitigation strategies are adhered to in the broader community. Local officials should seek out other sources of data to assess adherence to recommended mitigation strategies within the community. Each STLT can decide the most appropriate indicators to reference when deciding to open, close, or reopen schools.

Finally, the thresholds provided with each indicator should serve as a guide of inherent risk at the local level.

Description of indicators

The following are core and secondary indicators for decision makers to consider when deciding to open, close, or reopen schools over time. The core indicators include measures of underlying community transmission as well as a measure of adherence to key mitigation strategies.

Core indicators

Core indicators include one or both measures of community burden AND one self-assessed measure of school implementation of key mitigation strategies. Additional information including how to calculate these indicators is found in the table below.

Measures of community burden

The number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 14 days, AND/OR

The percentage of RT-PCR tests that are positive during the last 14 days, AND

Implementation of mitigation strategies

Schools should adopt the additional mitigation measures outlined below to the largest extent possible, practical and feasible.

Secondary indicators

Additionally, we provide secondary indicators that officials can use to support the decision-making process in local communities. These secondary indicators should not be used as the main criteria for determining the risk of disease transmission in schools. They should be used to support decision-making derived from the core indicators.

For example, knowing the percentage of hospital beds and intensive care unit beds occupied in a local hospital, including the percentage of inpatient beds occupied by a patient with COVID-19, can indicate the severity of illness in the community and whether the health care system can serve more patients. Similarly, the identification of a community outbreak indicates increased community transmission and, therefore, elevated risk of the introduction and subsequent transmission in schools.

Application and interpretation of indicators

Each indicator or combination of indicators should neither be used in isolation nor should they be viewed as hard cut-offs by STLT officials and school district decision-makers. Rather, they serve as broad guideposts of inherent risk to inform decision-making.

If, after applying the core indicators described in the table below, a school is at “medium,” “higher,” or “highest” risk of transmission, it does not mean that the school cannot re-open for in-person learning, but that the risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is higher and the school could consider alternative learning models (e.g., mix of in-person and virtual learning, also known as hybrid learning, or virtual-only).

Similarly, if a school meets all core indicators and many secondary indicators, a case or cases of COVID-19 may still occur in a school among students, teachers, administrators, and other staff. As a result, falling into the category of being at “lower” or “lowest” risk of transmission does not mean that the school should relax adherence to mitigation measures.

Officials should frequently monitor these indicators and adjust accordingly.

While risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a school may be lower when indicators of community spread are lower, this risk is dependent upon the implementation of school and community mitigation strategies. If community transmission is low but school and community mitigation strategies are not implemented, then the risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a school will increase. Alternately, if community transmission is high, but school and community mitigation strategies are implemented and strictly followed as recommended, then the risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a school will decrease.

Regardless of the level of risk, as determined by the indicators, it is critical that schools use multiple mitigation strategies including consistent and correct use of masks, social distancing to the extent possible, hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, cleaning and disinfection, and contact tracing to help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Vigilance to mitigation strategies within schools and the broader community will reduce the risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. This will enable schools that are open for in-person learning to stay open and accelerate the timeline of returning to full in-person learning by schools that began the school year using hybrid or virtual learning. The application and utility of these indicators are inextricably linked to schools and communities both following recommended mitigation strategies together.

By rigorously following mitigation strategies, current and future risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools can diminish over time regardless of baseline indicators – with risk of spread especially low when community transmission is low to begin with.",4/30/20 0:00,

Who will clean, how often, and where?

Cleaning and disinfecting reduce the risk of spreading infection by removing and killing germs on surfaces people frequently touch. Consider cleaning and disinfecting more frequently at your school to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.

Staff and scheduling

Make a plan with staff and teachers. Discuss obstacles to more frequent cleaning and disinfecting and ways to overcome those obstacles.

COVID-19 cases in the school

A school might need to implement short-term closure procedures regardless of community spread if an infected person has been in a school building. In addition, CDC recommends cleaning and disinfecting the school building thoroughly by:

Closing off areas used by the persons with COVID-19 for a significant amount of time. School administrators and staff may define this length of time (usually 15 minutes or longer) based on their specific needs and policies. Waiting as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection to minimize potential for exposure to respiratory droplets. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area.

If possible, wait up to 24 hours before beginning cleaning and disinfection. Cleaning and disinfecting all areas (e.g., offices, bathrooms, and common areas) used by the person(s) with COVID-19, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces. Surfaces should be cleaned using soap (or a detergent) and water prior to disinfection.

Disinfect with a disinfectant on List N: Disinfectants for use against SARs-CoV-2, external icon the virus that causes COVID-19.

In most instances, a single case of COVID-19 in a school would not warrant closing the entire school. Community spread and how much contact the person with COVID-19 had with others, as well as when such contact took place, need to be considered. These variables should also be considered when determining how long a school, or part of the school, stays closed. Administrators should work with local health officials to determine if temporarily closing the school building is necessary.

Hand hygiene: promoting it in your school

The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19, which is thought to spread mainly from person to person. Another key preventive action you can take is to regularly clean hands. Cleaning hands at key times with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not readily available is one of the most important steps a person can take to avoid getting sick. This helps prevent a variety of infections because:

People frequently touch their eyes, nose, and mouth without even realizing it. Germs can get into the body through the mouth, nose, and eyes and make us sick.

Germs from unwashed hands can be transferred to other objects, like handrails, tabletops, or keyboards, and then be transferred to another person’s hands.

Removing germs through handwashing therefore helps prevent diarrhea and respiratory infections and may even help prevent skin and eye infections.

Teaching people about handwashing helps them and their communities stay healthy. Handwashing can reduce respiratory illnesses, like colds, in the general population by up to 21%. Additionally, school-based programs promoting handwashing and hand hygiene can result in less gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses and fewer missed school days.

For more information, see CDC’s Handwashing: Clean Hands Save Lives website.

Establishing a culture of hand hygiene

Using hand sanitizers to reduce germs on hands

Use hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available

CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water because handwashing reduces the amounts of all types of germs and chemicals on hands. But if soap and water are not available, using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can help you avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others.

Soap and water remove all types of germs from hands, while sanitizer acts by killing certain germs on the skin. Although alcohol-based hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of germs in many situations, they should be used in the right situations.

When using hand sanitizer, apply the product to the palm of one hand (read the label to learn the correct amount) and rub the product all over the surfaces of your hands until your hands are dry.

Hand sanitizers are less effective than handwashing in some situations

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers kill the virus that causes COVID-19 when used correctly. However, hand sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including some germs that cause diarrhea. Always wash hands with soap and water after using the toilet.

Hand sanitizers may not be as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy. Hands are often dirty or greasy after activities like eating or playing outside.

Hand sanitizers might not remove harmful chemicals, like pesticides and heavy metals, from hands.",4/30/20 0:00,
Interim Guidance for Case Investigation and Contact Tracing in K-12 Schools,"Overview

To promote safe and healthy learning environments in K-12 schools, school administrators can work together with health departments to reduce the risk of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019). K-12 school administrators can play an important role in taking steps to slow the spread of disease to prevent outbreaks, and protect students, staff and teachers. Regardless of the level of community transmission, K-12 schools should be prepared for COVID-19 outbreaks in their communities that may introduce infection to the school setting, identification of cases among students, staff and teachers, and potential exposure(s) to COVID-19 that may occur at school facilities or events.

Operating schools during COVID-19: CDC’s Considerations provides guidance to assist K-12 school administrators in planning a comprehensive response. Case investigation and contact tracing are essential interventionspdf iconexternal icon in a successful, multipronged response to COVID-19, and should be implemented along with other mitigation strategies. As K-12 schools resume in-person learning, case investigation and contact tracing with staff, teachers and students should be anticipated as a crucial strategy to reduce further transmission once a case is identified. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages collaboration between K-12 schools and state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) health departments when investigating cases and exposures to infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Prompt and coordinated actions, including case investigation and contact tracing, may inform decision-making about strengthening, focusing, and relaxing mitigation strategies. This document aims to highlight potential collaboration between health officials and K-12 school administrators to facilitate effective case investigation and contact tracing.

Who this guidance is for: Administrators of public and private K-12 schools coordinating case investigations and contact tracing in schools, in order to inform policy development and program implementation. This document may also be informative for public health professionals coordinating K-12 school case investigations and contact tracing.

Background

COVID-19 is a nationally notifiable disease . When diagnosed or identified through laboratory or clinical criteria, COVID-19 cases are required to be reported, by healthcare providers and laboratories, to state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) health departments. When laboratories send positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 to health departments, many of these test results are received via electronic laboratory report. Testing locations, such as pharmacies and community testing sites, are also required to report positive test results to the health department for follow-up. Health care providers from a variety of clinical settings, including K-12 school-based clinics and community-based settings, also complete case reports on symptomatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Health departments have primary responsibility for case investigation and contact tracing. Case investigation and contact tracing are, core disease control measures employed by STLT health department personnel for decades, and an important part of the COVID-19 response.

Case investigation is the process of working with a person (patient) who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 to discuss their test result or diagnosis, assess their symptom history and health status, and provide instructions and support for self-isolation and symptom monitoring. This interaction is the first step to review the activity history of the person diagnosed with COVID-19, while infectious, and identify people (contacts) who may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Contact tracing is the process of notifying people (contacts) of their potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, provide information about the virus, and discuss their symptom history and other relevant health information. In addition, instructions for self-quarantine and monitoring for symptoms, and support and referrals to testing, clinical services, and other essential support services are provided, as indicated.

The case investigation and contact tracing processes help to prevent further transmission of disease by separating people who have (or may have) an infectious disease from people who do not. Prompt identification, voluntary self-quarantine, and monitoring of those contacts exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can effectively break the chain of transmission and prevent further spread of the virus in a community.

Classification of an individual as a close contact is based on many factors and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In the context of COVID-19, the definition of a close contact is someone who was within 6 feet of a person diagnosed with COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more. More information to inform the determination of exposure risk can be found, on CDC’s Public Health Guidance for Community-Related Exposure. This information further notes that: 1) data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Factors to consider when defining close contact include proximity, the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), and whether the exposure was from a person with symptoms (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). Furthermore, while research indicates masks may help keep those who are infected from spreading the infection, there is less information regarding how much protection masks offer a contact exposed to a symptomatic or asymptomatic patient. Therefore, the determination of close contact should be made irrespective of whether the person with COVID-19 or the contact was wearing a mask. 2) Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure. Recommendations vary on the length of time of exposure, but a total of 15 minutes or more close exposure can be used as an operational definition. Brief interactions are less likely to result in transmission; however, symptoms and the type of interaction (e.g., whether the infected person coughed directly into the face of the exposed individual) remain important. Assessment of exposure beyond close contact is a recommended strategy in some K-12 school and IHE settings to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause symptomatic illness and asymptomatic infection among young and healthy populations. K-12 schools may be a potential source of COVID-19 outbreaks, due to the number of individuals intermingling in close proximity for extended periods of time. K-12 school settings contain a mixed population of students, staff, and teachers, ranging from young children to older adults, who can be highly interconnected in multiple, close-contact networks such as classrooms, libraries, theatres, gymnasiums, social meal events, sports teams, clubs, dormitories, and transportation. Some studies show that transmission from young children may be limited, [ 1 ] but more data are needed as some countries have observed widespread disease transmission in primary schools. [ 2 ] A priority consideration for when an outbreak of COVID-19 is identified in a K-12 school is the subsequent exposure/transmission to other members of a school community, such as “older and/or more vulnerable individuals (e.g., teachers, school workers, volunteers, grandparents, or immunocompromised children or adults) who are in proximity to school children.” [ 3 ] In some instances, students may live in multigenerational households or have parents, guardians or caretakers with underlying health conditions, which may increase their risk for severe illness from COVID-19. These close settings, as well as close contact activities such as certain sports, may cause the K-12 school population and more broadly at-risk family members and caretakers to be at increased risk of transmission of the virus.

Health departments are responsible for leading case investigations, contact tracing, and outbreak investigations. Case investigation and contact tracing in response to COVID-19 transcends standard practice. Throughout the country, health departments are scaling up case investigation and contact tracing programs by using different staffing models and technology supports. Given the large number of COVID-19 cases reported to health departments, coupled with how easily and quickly SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, health department resources can be overwhelmed. Multisector partnerships can be an asset to expand the reach and timeliness of case investigation and contact tracing, thus facilitating prompt isolation and quarantine of cases and contacts. Partnerships between health departments and K-12 schools are encouraged as they may help to limit the spread of COVID-19, in these settings and local communities.",4/30/20 0:00,
COVID-19: K-12 Schools and Childcare Programs,"First, students with symptoms of COVID-19 should not attend school. Symptoms of asthma and COVID-19 may overlap, including cough and shortness of breath. Therefore, students experiencing acute asthma attacks should not be attending school without approval by a healthcare provider; if an asthma attack starts at school, a student may need a bronchodilator treatment before being sent home or before an ambulance arrives. The American Lung Association’s Model Policy for School Districts: Stock Bronchodilatorspdf iconexternal icon recommends using inhalers with disposable spacers/mouthpieces and nebulizers with disposable tubing with mask/mouthpieces. Inhalers and nebulizers should be used and cleaned according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

During this COVID-19 pandemic, asthma treatments using inhalers with spacers (with or without face mask, according to each student’s individualized treatment plan) are preferred over nebulizer treatments whenever possible. Based on limited data, use of asthma inhalers (with or without spacers or face masks) is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure.

Due to limited availability of data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated by nebulizer treatments are potentially infectious.1 During this COVID-19 pandemic, nebulizer treatments at school should be reserved for children who cannot use or do not have access to an inhaler (with or without spacer or face mask).

Use of peak flow meters, including in the school setting, includes forceful exhalation. Based on limited available data1, forceful exhalation is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure associated with increased risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19. However, for some people with asthma, using a peak flow meter can trigger cough.

Schools should obtain the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff who administer nebulizer treatments and peak flow meters to students with asthma. PPE for use when administering nebulizer treatments or peak flow meters to students with asthma consists of gloves, medical or surgical facemask and eye protection. School staff should be trained on when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, where this PPE is stored, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of used PPE. CDC has information on using PPE. Staff should also be trained on how to administer nebulizer treatments and peak flow meters.

During this COVID-19 pandemic, if a nebulizer treatment or use of peak flow meter is necessary at school for a student, the number of people present in the room should be limited to the student and the staff member administering the treatment or peak flow meter. If appropriate based on the student’s age and level of maturity, the staff member could leave the room and return when the nebulizer treatment is finished. After the nebulizer treatment or use of peak flow meter, this room should undergo routine cleaning and disinfection. CDC has information on how to clean and disinfect and how to prevent asthma attacks triggered by cleaning and disinfecting activities.

People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19. CDC has more information on COVID-19 for schools and healthcare providers (including school nurses).

Overview

To promote safe and healthy learning environments in Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), IHE administrators can work together with health departments to reduce the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). IHE administrators play an important role by taking steps to slow the spread of disease to prevent outbreaks, and protect students, staff, and faculty. Regardless of the level of community transmission, IHEs should be prepared for COVID-19 outbreaks in their communities that may introduce infection to the IHE, identification of cases among students, staff, and faculty, and potential exposure(s) to COVID-19 that may occur at IHE facilities or events.

Interim Guidance for Administrators of U.S. Institutions of Higher Education provides guidance to assist IHE administrators in planning a comprehensive response. Many IHEs are adopting approaches to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, transmission on campus. These approaches include increased social distancing in classrooms and dining halls, requirements for face masks, reducing density of on-campus housing, and various testing strategies. However, off-campus community settings including apartments, bars and restaurants, and community spaces related to campus (e.g., communities of faith, Greek organizations, athletic events, other mass gatherings) can also pose a risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These off-campus settings should also be considered in case investigation and contract tracing efforts.

Case investigation and contact tracing are essential interventions pdf icon[9.9 MB, 20 Pages]external icon in a successful, multipronged response to COVID-19, and should be implemented along with other mitigation strategies. As students move into communities near IHEs, and IHEs resume in-person learning, case investigation and contact tracing with students, faculty and staff associated with the campus should be anticipated as a crucial strategy to reduce further transmission once a case is identified. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages collaboration between IHEs and state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) health departments when investigating cases and exposures to infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Factors to consider when defining a close contact include proximity, the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), and whether the exposure was from a person with symptoms (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). Furthermore, while research indicates masks may help keep those who are infected from spreading the infection, there is less information regarding how much protection masks offer a contact exposed to a symptomatic or asymptomatic patient. Therefore, the determination of close contact should be made irrespective of whether the person with COVID-19 or the contact was wearing a mask. 2) Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure. Recommendations vary on the length of time of exposure, but within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more can be used as an operational definition. Brief interactions are less likely to result in transmission; however, symptoms and the type of interaction (e.g., whether the infected person coughed directly into the face of the exposed individual) remain important. Assessment of exposure, beyond close contacts, is a recommended strategy in some IHE settings to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) can cause symptomatic illness and asymptomatic infection among young and healthy populations. The IHE setting may be a potential source of COVID-19 outbreaks due to the number of individuals intermingling in close proximity for extended periods of time. IHE settings contain a mixed population of students, staff, and faculty, ranging from young to older adults, who can be highly interconnected in multiple, close-contact networks such as classrooms, libraries, theaters, gymnasiums, social meal events (e.g., brown bag lunch lectures, grazing tables at IHE events, study and snacking sessions, dining facilities), sports teams, clubs, dormitories, on-campus work environments, transportation, and fraternities/sororities. These close settings, as well as close contact activities such as certain sports, may cause the IHE population to be at increased risk of transmission of the virus. In addition, many campuses host child-care centers, operate retail centers or have venues open to the general population. COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported from IHEs that extended beyond students, to include household and community contacts.1 Additionally, modeling studies have estimated that new cases of COVID-19 increase more quickly within a residential IHE setting than in the general population.2 Close-contact residential settings (on-campus and off-campus), large group classes in closed indoor settings, and frequent small-group interactions, have been modeled to demonstrate that multiple, short chains of infection can increase the likelihood of virus spread. 3 As a result of this close-contact network, it is important to use case investigation and contact tracing to rapidly identify persons who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, those who have been exposed to the virus, and those who may be at risk for possible exposure. This identification process is necessary to mitigate transmission and prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Health departments are responsible for leading case investigations, contact tracing, and outbreak investigations. Case investigation and contact tracing in response to COVID-19 transcends standard practice. Throughout the country, health departments are scaling up case investigation and contact tracing programs by using different staffing models and technology supports. Given the large number of COVID-19 cases reported to health departments, coupled with how easily and quickly SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, health department resources can be overwhelmed. Multisector partnerships can be an asset to expand the reach and timeliness of case investigation and contact tracing, thus facilitating prompt isolation and quarantine of cases and contacts. Partnerships between health departments and IHEs are encouraged because they may help limit the spread of COVID-19, in these settings and local communities.",4/30/20 0:00,
Guidance for Student Foreign Travel for Institutions of Higher Education,"This guidance is for Institutes of Higher Education with international travel or study abroad programs.

Consider postponing or canceling student international travel programs

Given the COVID-19 pandemic, Institutes of Higher Education (IHE) should consider postponing or canceling upcoming student international travel programs. Those overseeing student international travel programs should be aware that students may face unpredictable circumstances, such as travel restrictions, challenges returning home, and challenges accessing health care while abroad.

If IHEs choose to continue student international travel programs, they should evaluate the risks in the host country by checking CDC’s COVID-19 Travel Health Notices by Destination and The U.S. Department of State’s Travel advisoriesexternal icon. They can also check with the destination’s Office of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Health, and the U.S. Department of State about COVID-19-specific entry requirements, such as COVID-19 testing and quarantine.",9/10/20 0:00,
Youth Sports Program FAQs,"Sports that require close interaction, are played indoors, and share equipment may pose a greater risk for COVID-19 infection or transmission. The virus spreads mainly from person-to-person among other ways. The more people a player or coach interacts with, the closer the physical interaction, the more sharing of equipment there is by multiple players, and the longer the interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.

To determine which sports are safer to play during the COVID-19 pandemic, consider the following:

Physical closeness of players during play

Amount of necessary touching of shared equipment and gear

Ability to engage in social distancing while not actively engaged in play such as when on the bench or sideline

Age of the player and their ability to comply with social distancing and other protective actions

Size of the team and field of play

Presence of nonessential visitors, spectators, volunteers during practices or games

Travel required outside of the local community

Sports that require frequent closeness or contact between players may make it more difficult to maintain social distancing and therefore may present increased risk for COVID-19 spread. For close-contact sports like wrestling or basketball, play may be modified to safely increase distance between players.

For example: Coaches and players can focus on individual skill building or conditioning instead of competition; Coaches can limit close or full contact (such as tackling, checking or guarding) to competitions or game-like situations (such as scrimmages) or limit the number of participants involved in close or full contact situations; Leagues can decrease the number of competitions during a season.



For sports that are normally played indoors such as hockey and gymnastics, coaches can focus on individual skill building or conditioning in lieu of team-based practice, limit the number of players or athletes in the facility at one time so they can space out by at least 6 feet, or conduct modified practices outdoors.",4/30/20 0:00,
Considerations for Community-Based Organizations,"As some community-based organizations (CBOs) begin to resume or increase their level of activities, CDC offers the following considerations for ways these organizations can help protect individuals and communities and slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CBOs can play a vital role in maintaining community morale and cohesion. They can also serve as a crucial link between communities and local health and other officials, providing insight about the feasibility and acceptability of proposed mitigation strategies and informing authorities about resources and needs in their communities.

CBOs work at the local level to meet community needs. They include social service agencies, nonprofit organizations, and formal and informal community groups, like neighborhood groups or recreational or special-interest clubs. Depending on the nature of their work, a CBO’s stakeholders may include volunteers, members, clients, supporters, patrons, program participants, and event attendees.

These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which organizations must comply. CBOs can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. CBOs should continually assess, based on current conditions, how to modify their operations and programming to both advance their mission and protect their staff and stakeholders.

CBOs may also benefit from reviewing CDC’s COVID-19 information focused on workplaces, events and gatherings, food service providers, youth sports, youth and summer camps, childcare programs, and people at higher risk of severe illness.

Guiding Principles to Keep in Mind

The more people an individual interacts with, and the longer that interaction lasts, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. Location can be a factor, too, with outdoor activities generally being less risky than indoor activities. The risk of COVID-19 spread increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Meetings and other activities are conducted virtually. Only essential activities (i.e., provision of essential services) occur in person. More risk: Small, in-person gatherings like board meetings or support groups are held. Outdoor activities and meetings are prioritized. Individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and do not share objects. No food is served at meetings or events. Most staff telework and if staff or stakeholders are present in a facility, they are required to wear masks (if able) and maintain social distancing. Rigorous cleaning and disinfecting practices are implemented. Attendees at the organization’s meeting and events come from the same local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, county). Higher risk: Indoor activities are held. Medium-sized in-person gatherings are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart. In CBO facilities, common areas are closed, and staff are encouraged to wear masks (if able) and maintain social distancing. Food is served in pre-packaged boxes with disposable utensils to eliminate the need for shared items or congregating around serving tables. For meetings and events, a limited number of attendees come from outside the local geographic area. Highest risk: Standard operations and programming are resumed. Large in-person gatherings are held where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart. Food is served “potluck” or family style. Many event attendees come from outside the local geographic area.

Targeting COVID-19’s Spread

The virus that causes COVID-19 is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people cough, sneeze, or talk. Someone can also get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own nose, mouth, or possibly their eyes. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as staying home when sick, social distancing, wearing a mask, and handwashing) and environmental prevention practices (such as cleaning and disinfection) are important ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

These prevention principles are covered in this document. They provide CBOs with actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during sponsored activities.

Promoting Healthy Behaviors that Reduce Spread of COVID-19

CBOs should consider implementing strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Hand Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette Require frequent employee handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence. If soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol can be used; rub hands together until dry. Encourage staff to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Encourage alternate forms of greeting besides handshakes, hugs, and kissing. For example, introduce a new practice of waving or bowing. Encourage clients and others coming to your office or attending events to engage in these same practices.



Masks Require the use of masks among staff and volunteers, as feasible. Masks are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult. Information should be provided to all staff and volunteers on proper use, removal, and washing of masks. Note: Masks should not be placed on: Babies or children younger than 2 years old Anyone who has trouble breathing Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer may have the virus and not know it. Masks are not meant to be a substitute for personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, respirators, or other medical personal protective equipment. Encourage clients and other stakeholders coming to your facility or attending events to bring and use masks .



Adequate Supplies Ensure you have accessible sinks and enough supplies available for staff, facility visitors, and attendees to clean their hands and cover their coughs and sneezes at all events. Supplies include soap, water, a way to dry hands (e.g., paper towels, hand dryer), tissues, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans (preferably covered).



Maintaining Healthy Environments

CBOs should consider implementing strategies to maintain healthy environments.

Restrooms Consider limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time to allow for social distancing. If lines form near the restroom, ensure people remain at least 6 feet from each other. Ensure that restrooms are: Cleaned and disinfected regularly, particularly high-touch surfaces such as faucets, toilets, doorknobs, and light switches. Clean and disinfect restrooms daily or more often, if possible, and use EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19 pdf icon . Regularly stocked with supplies for handwashing, including soap, water, and disposable paper towels or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid supplying reusable towels. Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep products away from children.



Ventilation Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling or triggering asthma symptoms).



Water Systems To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated with stagnant water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized, but encourage people working in or visiting your facility to bring their own water, as feasible, to minimize use and touching of water fountains.



Physical Barriers and Guides Provide physical guides (e.g., guides for creating “one-way routes”), such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times. Install physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart. Barriers can be useful at reception areas, distribution counters, and other areas where remaining at least 6 feet apart is difficult.



Communal Spaces Use methods to physically separate employees in all areas of the facilities including work areas and other areas such as meeting rooms, break rooms, parking lots, entrance and exit areas, and locker rooms; otherwise, stagger use and clean and disinfect between use. Arrange reception or other communal seating area chairs by turning, draping (covering chair with tape or fabric so seats cannot be used), spacing, or removing chairs to maintain social distancing.



Food Service There is no evidence that people can get COVID-19 from eating food. However, sharing utensils and congregating around food service areas may present risks. If food is offered at any meeting or event, have individual, pre-packaged boxes or bags instead of a potluck, buffet, or family-style meal. Avoid sharing of foods and utensils. If the organization hosts an event that includes food service, refer to CDC’s COVID-19 considerations for restaurants and bars. Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals not from the same household remain at least 6 feet apart when waiting in line to order or pick up. Use disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, dishes). If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.



Shared Objects Discourage people from sharing items that are difficult to clean, sanitize, or disinfect in between use, such as food containers, tools, equipment, or supplies. Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials to the extent possible; otherwise, limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of people at a time and clean and disinfect between use.



Maintaining Healthy Operations

CBOs should consider implementing strategies to maintain healthy operations.

Regulatory Awareness Be aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.



Participation in Community Response Efforts Consider participating with local authorities in broader COVID-19 community response efforts (e.g., sitting on community response committees) and collaborating with other CBOs to coordinate activities or limit duplication of efforts, where possible. Inform local authorities about areas of concern or previously unknown issues as well as community or organizational resources that might be helpful in responding to changing circumstances in the community.



Flexible and Responsive Operations and Communication Plans Define roles, responsibilities, and decision-making protocols so that the organization can adjust operations, services, and programming in response to changing community conditions. Develop a communication plan to alert stakeholders to changes in operations and ensure that contact information is up to date. Develop information-sharing systems with partners, including local health officials.



Designated COVID-19 Point of Contact Designate a staff person to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All staff and stakeholders should know who this person is and how to contact them.



Protections for Staff and Others who are at Higher Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19 Offer options that limit exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities) for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions). As feasible, offer options that limit the COVID-19 exposure risk (e.g., virtual attendance) for stakeholders who are at higher risk for severe illness. Replace in-person meetings with video- or tele-conference calls whenever possible. Limit event attendance to staff and attendees who live in the local geographic area (e.g., community, city, town, county) to reduce risk of spread from areas with higher levels of COVID-19. Put in place policies that protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding their underlying medical conditions.



Social Distancing and Modifying Layouts Reconfigure office spaces, waiting or meeting rooms, break rooms, conference rooms, or similar areas to allow for at least 6 feet between people. In situations where people will form lines, encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by providing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks. Limit attendance at events to allow for social distancing, or host smaller events in larger rooms. Prioritize outdoor activities where attendees can remain at least 6 feet from others not living in their household. If distributing items like food or supplies, consider using drive-up distribution so that people can maintain distance from each other and to eliminate the need to touch doorknobs and other items and surfaces in a facility. Consider temporarily suspending singing, chanting, or shouting during events especially when participants are in close proximity to each other. If attendees choose to sing, chant, or shout, encourage them to wear masks and increase distance between people to greater than 6 feet.



Meetings, Gatherings, and Performances Pursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings, if possible, and promote social distancing of at least 6 feet between people if in-person events are held. Limit group size to the extent possible. Prioritize outdoor activities where attendees can remain at least 6 feet from others not living in their household. When planning events, consult CDC’s Considerations for Gatherings and Community Events. Limit any nonessential visitors, spectators, and volunteers at events. Limit activities involving external groups or organizations as much as possible – especially with individuals not from the local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, or county). Consider temporarily suspending musical performances that involve singing or playing wind instruments. If such events are held, musicians should be spaced as far apart as feasible, ideally farther than 6 feet apart.



Childcare and Youth Programming If providing a nursery or childcare during meetings or events, refer to CDC’s information on preventing the spread of COVID-19 in childcare settings. If holding summer day camps, refer to CDC’s information on youth and summer camps.



Identifying Small Groups and Keeping Them Together (Cohorting) Ensure that groupings of staff, volunteers, and program participants are as small and as static as possible. CBOs should consider: Scheduling staff and volunteers together in small groups (cohorts) so that they are always scheduled to work on the same days/times together, reducing their exposure risk. Ensuring attendees of regular events (e.g., support groups) are scheduled with the same group of attendees for each event so that individuals are in contact with the same people for each visit, and so that distinct groupings do not mix. Limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of people at a time and clean and disinfect between use.



Staggered Scheduling Stagger arrival times or locations for meetings and events. Use flexible worksites (e.g., telework) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing of at least 6 feet between employees, volunteers, and others.



Transportation For employees who commute to work using public transportation or ride sharing, encourage them to use transportation options that minimize close contact with others (e.g., walking or biking, driving or riding by car – alone or with household members only) or consider offering the following support: Ask employees to follow the CDC guidance on how to Protect Yourself When Using Transportation, including public transit. Allow employees to shift their hours so they can commute during less busy times. Ask employees to maintain social distance when possible, wear a mask if able, and wash their hands as soon as possible when they arrive to work.



Where possible, avoid activities that require shared transportation vehicles. If using shared transportation vehicles like vans or buses, clean and disinfect them according to the guidance for bus transit operators or drivers for hire. Ensure that drivers and passengers wear masks, if they are able; remain about 6 feet apart, as feasible; and wash their hands as soon as possible after the trip.



Communication Systems Put systems in place to: Encourage staff and stakeholders who come to your facility or attend events sponsored by your organization to self-report to the designated COVID-19 point of contact if they have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19 external icon (e.g., see “Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts” in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below), and other applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations. Notify staff and stakeholders of cancellations and restrictions in place to limit exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., limited hours of operation). Identify and address potential language, cultural, and environmental barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to organization staff and stakeholders. Tailor information so that it is easily understood by various audiences and is available in a variety of languages and formats. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures by visiting: Know Your Audience. You can also, learn more about communicating to staff in a crisis at Crisis Communications.

Leave (Time Off) Policies Implement flexible sick leave policies and practices that are not punitive and that enable employees to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, are caring for someone who is sick, or who must stay home with children if schools or childcare centers are closed. Examine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation as needed. Ensure employees are aware of these policies.







Back-Up Staffing Plan Monitor absenteeism of employees and critical volunteers, cross-train staff and volunteers, and create a roster of trained back-up staff and volunteers. Develop policies for employees and volunteers to return to their duties and the facility after having COVID-19. CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.



Staff Training Train staff on all safety protocols. Use CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers as a guide. Conduct training virtually or ensure that participants maintain social distancing during training. As volunteers often perform important duties, consider similar monitoring, planning, and training for them. Consider that volunteer and staffing levels may need to increase to implement cleaning and safety protocols.



Close Contact CBO staff or volunteers who have close contact (within 6 feet) with clients (e.g., people who visit client homes) should take extra precautions. CBOs should consult with local public health officials and occupational safety and health professionals to decide whether staff or volunteers should wear any form of personal protective equipment rather than or in addition to a mask. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Masks are not meant to be a substitute for personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, respirators, or other medical personal protective equipment. Limit the amount of time staff or volunteers are in close contact (within 6 feet) with others, to the extent feasible. Maintain a supply of masks for clients to wear (if able) and provide guidance on how to wear them properly. Remind clients to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Proper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure. Ensure employees and volunteers wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, provide an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. Key times to clean hands in general include: Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating food After using the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing Before entering a client’s home and upon leaving After touching frequently touched surfaces After putting on, touching, or removing masks Employees and volunteers should avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.



Recognize Signs and Symptoms If feasible, conduct daily health checks (e.g., temperature screening and/or symptom checking) of staff, volunteers, and others who come to your facility or attend your events safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. CBOs should consider using examples of screening methods in CDC’s General Business FAQs as a guide.



Sharing Facilities Encourage any organizations that share or use your facility to also follow these considerations. Limit shared facility use, if possible.



Support Coping and Resilience Promote employees’ ability to eat healthy foods, exercise, get enough sleep, and find time to unwind. Encourage employees and others to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling. Consider posting signs for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746; the National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 and TTY 1-800-787-3224; and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255).



Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick

CBOs should consider strategies to implement when someone gets sick.

Advise Sick Individuals of Home Isolation Criteria Communicate to sick staff members that they should not return to work until they have met CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation. Similarly, communicate to volunteers and others who come to your facility or events that they should stay away until they have met CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation.



Isolate and Transport Those Who are Sick Make sure that staff and others at your facility or event know that they should not come to the facility or event, and that they should notify the designated COVID-19 point of contact if they become sick with COVID-19 symptoms, test positive for COVID-19, or have been exposed to someone with symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case. Immediately separate anyone with COVID-19 symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, shortness of breath). People who are sick should go home or to a healthcare facility, depending on how severe their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for themselves. Anyone who has had close contact with a person who has symptoms should be separated, sent home, and advised to follow CDC guidance for community-related exposure (see “Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts” below). If symptoms develop, individuals should follow CDC guidance for caring for themselves. Identify an isolation area(s) to separate anyone who has COVID-19 symptoms or who has tested positive but does not have symptoms. Establish procedures for safely transporting anyone who becomes sick to their home or to a healthcare facility. If you are calling an ambulance or bringing someone to the hospital, try to call first to alert them that the person may have COVID-19.

Considerations for Events and Gatherings,"As some communities in the United States begin to plan and hold events and gatherings, the CDC offers the following considerations for enhancing protection of individuals and communities and preventing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Event planners and officials can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Because COVID-19 virus circulation varies in communities, these considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which gatherings must comply. Organizers should continue to assess, based on current conditions, whether to postpone, cancel, or significantly reduce the number of attendees for gatherings.

After reviewing the considerations listed on this page, event planners and administrators can use CDC’s Events and Gatherings Readiness and Planning Tool pdf icon[9 pages] to protect staff, volunteers, and attendees.

Guiding Principles

A gathering refers to a planned or spontaneous event, indoors or outdoors, with a small number of people participating or a large number of people in attendance such as a community event or gathering, concert, festival, conference, parade, wedding, or sporting event.

The more people an individual interacts with at a gathering and the longer that interaction lasts, the higher the potential risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and COVID-19 spreading.

The higher the level of community transmission in the area that the gathering is being held, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spreading during a gathering.

The size of an event or gathering should be determined based on state, local, territorial or tribal safety laws and regulations.

The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings. More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear masks, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county). Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area. Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Targeting COVID-19’s spread

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is thought to be mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It is thought that the virus may also spread to hands from a contaminated surface and then to the nose, mouth or eyes, causing infection. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as handwashing, staying home when sick, maintaining 6 feet of distance, and wearing a mask) and environmental prevention practices (such as cleaning and disinfection) are important ways to prevent the virus’s spread.

These prevention principles are covered in this document. They provide event planners and individuals with actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during gatherings and events.

Promoting Healthy Behaviors that Reduce Spread

Event planners should consider implementing strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19 among staff and attendees.

Hand Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette Require frequent employee handwashing (e.g., before, during, and after taking tickets; after touching garbage) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence. If soap and water are not readily available, employees can use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol and rub their hands until dry. Encourage staff to cover the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Encourage attendees to wash hands often and cover coughs and sneezes. Attendees often exchange handshakes, fist bumps, and high-fives at meetings and sporting events. Display signs (physical and/or electronic) that discourage these actions during the event.



Masks Require the use of masks among staff. Masks are most essential in times when physical distancing is difficult (e.g., when moving within a crowd or audience). Provide all staff with information on proper use, removal, and washing of masks. Advise staff that masks should not be placed on: Babies or children younger than 2 years old Anyone who has trouble breathing Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance Encourage attendees ahead of the event to bring and use masks at the event. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Masks are not meant to be a substitute for personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, respirators, or other medical personal protective equipment. Masks are strongly encouraged in settings where individuals might raise their voice (e.g., shouting, chanting, singing).



Adequate Supplies Ensure you have accessible sinks and enough supplies for people to clean their hands and cover their coughs and sneezes. Supplies include soap, water, a way to dry hands (e.g., paper towels, hand dryer), tissues, hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans (preferably covered).



Maintaining Healthy Environments

Event planners should consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy environments.

Cleaning and Disinfection Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces within the venue at least daily or between uses as much as possible—for example, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains, grab bars, hand railings, and cash registers. Clean and disinfect shared objects between uses—for example, payment terminals, tables, countertops, bars, and condiment holders. Consider closing areas such as drinking fountains that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected during an event. Develop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection. Plan for and enact these cleaning routines when renting event space and ensure that other groups who may use your facilities follow these routines. If transport vehicles like buses are used by the event staff, drivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff—for example, washing hands often and wearing masks and maintaining social distance of bus riders. To clean and disinfect event buses, vans, or other vehicles see guidance for bus transit operators and drivers for hire, and adapt as needed. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaners and disinfectants external icon to avoid harm to employees and other individuals. Always read and follow label instructions for each product, and store products securely away from children. Use EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19 external icon . Cleaning products should not be used near children. Staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent attendees or themselves from inhaling toxic vapors. Use disposable gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash. After using disposable gloves, throw them out in a lined trash can. Do not disinfect or reuse the gloves. Wash hands after removing gloves.



Restrooms Consider limiting the number of people who occupy the restroom at one time to allow for social distancing. Do not allow lines or crowds to form near the restroom without maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from other people. It may be helpful to post signs or markers to help attendees maintain the appropriate social distance of at least 6 feet. Ensure that open restrooms are: Operational with functional toilets. Cleaned and disinfected regularly, particularly high-touch surfaces such as faucets, toilets, stall doors, doorknobs, countertops, diaper changing tables, and light switches. Clean and disinfect restrooms daily or more often, if possible, with EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19. Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep products away from children. Stocked with enough supplies for handwashing, including soap and water, a way to dry hands (e.g., paper towels, hand dryer), tissues, hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), tissues, and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans (preferably covered). If you are providing portable toilets, also provide portable handwashing stations and ensure that they remain stocked throughout the duration of the event. If possible, provide hand sanitizer stations that are touch-free.



Ventilation Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example, by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk to staff or attendees (e.g., risk of falling or triggering asthma symptoms). If portable ventilation equipment like fans are used, take steps to minimize air from them blowing from one person directly at another person to reduce the potential spread of any airborne or aerosolized viruses.



Water Systems

To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized, but encourage staff and attendees to bring their own water, as feasible, to minimize touching and use of water fountains.



Modified Layouts Limit attendance or seating capacity to allow for social distancing, or host smaller events in larger rooms. Use multiple entrances and exits and discourage crowded waiting areas. Block off rows or sections of seating in order to space people at least 6 feet apart. Eliminate lines or queues if possible or encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by providing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks. Prioritize outdoor activities where social distancing can be maintained as much as possible. Offer online attendance options in addition to in-person attendance to help reduce the number of attendees.



Physical Barriers and Guides Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (e.g., guides for creating one-way routes). Install physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart. Barriers can be useful at cash registers and other areas where maintaining physical distance of 6 feet is difficult. Change seating layout or availability of seating so that people can remain least 6 feet apart.



Communal Spaces Stagger use of shared indoor spaces such as dining halls, game rooms, and lounges as much as possible and clean and disinfect them between uses. Add physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks and beds, especially when they cannot be at least 6 feet apart. Clean and disinfect bathrooms regularly (e.g., in the morning and evening or after times of heavy use) using EPA-registered disinfectants external icon . For more information on communal spaces in event housing (e.g., laundry rooms, shared bathrooms, and recreation areas) follow CDC’s guidance for Shared or Congregate Housing.



Food Service There is no evidence that COVID-19 is spread by food. However, people sharing utensils and congregating around food service areas can pose a risk. If the event includes food service, refer to CDC’s COVID-19 considerations for restaurants and bars . Use touchless payment options as much as possible, if available. Ask customers and employees to exchange cash or card payments by placing them on a receipt tray or on the counter rather than by hand to avoid direct hand-to-hand contact. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as pens, counters, or hard surfaces between use and encourage patrons to use their own pens. Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart when waiting in line to order or pick up. If a cafeteria or group dining room is used, serve individually plated meals or grab-and-go options, and hold activities in separate areas. Use disposable food service items including utensils and dishes. If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items. Avoid offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as buffets, salad bars, and drink stations. Consider having pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee.



Shared Objects Discourage people from sharing items that are difficult to clean, sanitize, or disinfect. Limit any sharing of food, tools, equipment, or supplies by staff members. Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials to the extent possible; otherwise, limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of staff members or attendees at a time, and clean and disinfect them between use.



Maintaining Healthy Operations

Event organizers and staff may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy operations.

Regulatory Awareness Be aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.



Protections for Staff and Attendees who are at Higher Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19 Offer options for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of any age with underlying medical conditions) that limit their exposure risk. For example: Offer telework and modified job responsibilities for staff, such as setting up for the event rather than working at the registration desk. Replace in-person meetings with video- or tele-conference calls whenever possible. As feasible, offer options for attendees at higher risk for severe illness that limit their exposure risk (e.g., virtual attendance). Consider limiting event attendance to staff and guests who live in the local area (e.g., community, city, town, or county) to reduce risk of spreading the virus from areas with higher levels of COVID-19. If attendance is open to staff and guests from other communities, cities, town or counties, provide information to attendees so they can make an informed decision about participation. Put policies in place to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding their underlying medical conditions.



Limited, Staggered, or Rotated Shifts and Attendance Times

Consider ways to significantly reduce the number of attendees. Use flexible worksites (e.g., telework) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing of 6 feet between employees, volunteers, and others. Rotate or stagger shifts and arrival times to limit the number of employees in a venue at the same time. Stagger and limit attendance times to minimize the number of guests at the venue.



Travel & Transit Encourage employees to use transportation options that minimize close contact with others (e.g., walking or biking, driving or riding by car – alone or with household members only). Consider offering the following support: Ask employees to follow the CDC guidance on how to Protect Yourself When Using Transportation, including public transit. Allow employees to shift their hours so they can commute during less busy times. Ask employees to wash their hands as soon as possible after their trip.



Reconfigure parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper separation of employees (e.g., closing every other parking space). Encourage rideshare drivers to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in the vehicle and avoid providing pooled rides or picking up multiple passengers who would not otherwise be riding together on the same route.



Designated COVID-19 Point of Contact Designate an administrator or office to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All staff and attendees should know who this person or office is and how to contact them.



Communication Systems Put systems in place to: Encourage staff and attendees to self-report to event officials or a COVID-19 point of contact if they have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days, in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19 (e.g., see “Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts” in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below ), and other applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations. Advise attendees prior to the event or gathering that they should not attend if they have symptoms of, a positive test for, or were recently exposed (within 14 days) to COVID-19. Notify staff, attendees, and the public of cancellations and restrictions in place to limit people’s exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., limited hours of operation). Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to event staff and participants. Tailor information so that it is easily understood by various audiences and is available in alternative formats and languages. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures by visiting: Know Your Audience. You also can learn more about communicating to staff in a crisis at: Crisis Communications Plan. external icon



Leave (Time Off) Policies Implement flexible sick leave policies and practices that are not punitive and enable employees to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, are caring for someone who is sick, or who must stay home with children if schools or child care centers are closed. Examine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation as needed. Ensure that any relevant policies are communicated to staff.



Back-Up Staffing Plan Monitor absenteeism of employees, cross-train staff, and create a roster of trained back-up staff. Develop policies for return-to-work and event facilities after an employee has COVID-19. CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.



Staff Training Train staff on all safety protocols. Consider using CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers as a guide. Conduct training virtually to ensure that social distancing is maintained during training. If training needs to be done in person, maintain social distancing. Virtual training is clearly better for infection control when feasible.



Recognize Signs and Symptoms If feasible, conduct daily health checks (e.g., temperature screening and/or symptom checking) of staff and attendees safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. Event administrators may consider using examples of screening methods in CDC’s General Business FAQs as a guide.



Sharing Facilities Encourage any organizations that share or use the same venue to also follow these considerations and limit shared use, if possible.



Support Coping and Resilience Promote employees’ ability to eat healthy foods, exercise, get enough sleep, and find time to unwind. Encourage employees to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling. Consider posting signs for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746; The National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 and TTY 1-800-787-3224; and The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255).



Lessons Learned After the Event Meet with the emergency operations coordinator or planning team for your venue to discuss and note lessons learned. Determine ways to improve planning and implementation processes if the event will happen again. Update your plans regularly according to the state and local situation and orders.



Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick

Event planners should consider several strategies to implement when someone gets sick.

Advise Sick Individuals of Home Isolation Criteria Communicate to sick staff members that they should not return to work until they have met CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation.



Clean and Disinfect Close off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting them (for outdoor areas, this includes surfaces or shared objects in the area, if applicable). Wait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning external icon and disinfection products, including storing them securely away from children.



Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts In accordance with state and local laws and regulations, event planners should notify local health officials, staff, and attendees of any case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) external icon and other applicable laws and regulations. Advise those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home, self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.

Considerations for Food Pantries and Food Distribution Sites,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges to food security across the U.S. Access to healthy food options and nutrition are important to overall physical and mental health and well-being. Food insecurity is expected to continue to increase for many households with more children not attending childcare and school in-person (a source of nutritious meals for many students) and with changes in employment status during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Find food and food system resources during COVID-19 for individuals seeking assistance, food assistance programs, and food system stakeholders.

Food pantries and food distribution sites provide donated food at no cost to people who have limited access and play an important role in communities. Community organizations often work with food pantries to provide food to families. Food pantries can have their own building, be in schools or churches, be mobile (e.g., in a truck), or distribute food in other ways, such as drive-through pickup distribution. Managers of food pantries and distribution sites should take special precautions to help staff, volunteers, and clients stay safe while continuing to prioritize the respect and dignity of clients.

Managers of food pantries and food distribution sites can consider these steps to help ensure safe access to food for their clients while helping prevent the spread of COVID-19. These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, tribal, local, and territorial health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which organizations must comply. Food pantry and distribution site managers can determine, in collaboration with state, tribal, local, and territorial health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community.

Planners and managers of food pantries and food distribution sites may also benefit from reviewing CDC’s COVID-19 guidance and considerations on community-based organizations, workplaces, events and gatherings, and grocery and food retail workers.

Planners and managers should review CDC’s information on people at increased risk for severe illness, employers with workers at high risk, and people experiencing homelessness. Extra precautions should be provided for staff, volunteers, and clients who may be at higher risk of severe illness or may be experiencing homelessness to protect them from exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.

Operational Considerations

Follow state, tribal, local, and territorial regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings and determine whether food distribution operations need to be adapted to continue client access to food resources while accommodating any such restrictions.

Determine the mode of food distribution to use based on local policies and local level of spread. Food pantry managers should continually assess how to modify their mode of food distribution (e.g., delivering to clients or using onsite pick-up) based on current levels of spread in each community they serve. Delivery of food items in ways that minimize in-person interactions are lower risk than onsite, indoor modes of distribution.

Consider expanding hours to help stagger the times that both staff/volunteers and clients are present at the facility.

Require all staff and volunteers to wash their hands before, after, and frequently during shifts and to wear masks, if feasible.

Consider regular symptom screenings of staff, volunteers, and clients who come onsite.

Include accessibility accommodations for people with disabilities if changes in set up or distribution mode or the context of COVID-19 presents new challenges. For example, ensure food products are stacked to a height reachable from a wheelchair in onsite pantries. Make sure signage about new protocols are adapted for lower literacy audiences and available in different languages spoken by clients served.

Select modes of distribution

Delivery

Based on the level of spread in your community and the safety and accessibility of transportation options, pre-packing and delivering food items to individuals and families may present the lowest risk of COVID-19 spread with greatest reach. This option is also best to serve clients who need to stay home because they are sick, have recently had contact with someone who is sick, or are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19. Establish a drop-off location (such as a doorstep) and time to deliver food without any physical contact, when clients will be available and able to bring food inside for proper storage right away. Try to include enough food variety and account for family size and any dietary or infant feeding needs and religious or cultural preferences. Include multiple days of food and, when possible, enough food for at least a week to help reduce the number of interactions needed. To promote healthy habits and nutritional education, consider adapting a choice model for the delivery mode. Distribute lists of options ahead of time and gather client selections over the phone prior to delivery, so that clients can receive their preferred food products.



Onsite distribution

If possible, distribute food outdoors.

If resources are available, consider having hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and masks (can be disposable as a more affordable option) at the entrance for clients to use upon entering.

Consider ways to schedule client times onsite to limit the number of people at any given time and to prevent crowds.

Modify the layout, as needed, to facilitate social distancing between staff, volunteers, and clients (maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet between people).

Consider providing a drive-through model in which clients can receive a box of food placed directly in their vehicle by staff or volunteers.

Choice pantries

Choice pantries are distribution sites that are set up like a grocery store. Clients come in and choose their food products while accompanied by a volunteer. While choice pantries are considered the best model for food pantries from a nutritional standpoint, special considerations should be made if COVID-19 is spreading in the community, and pantries should operate in accordance with local public health policies.

Use the same operational considerations (scheduling staggered shifts, mask protocols, setting up outside, etc.) as onsite distribution.

Because choice pantries are similar in design to grocery stores, managers, staff, and volunteers should consider CDC’s information for grocery store and food retail employees.

Cleaning and disinfection

Follow CDC Guidance on Cleaning and Disinfection to prepare and maintain a safe environment for workers and clients.

Encourage staying home when sick or recently had close contact with someone with COVID-19

*Consider modifications to provide clients who need to stay home because they are sick, recently had close contact with a person who is sick,or are at higher risk with food. Modifications could include providing delivery to these clients, if feasible/affordable, or allowing clients to designate other people who live outside of their home who can pick up food and deliver it to their home.

Plan for what to do if an employee, volunteer, or client who comes onsite becomes sick by referring to relevant sections in CDC’s Considerations for Community-Based Organizations.

Volunteer and Employee Safety

Train staff and volunteers on new procedures. If possible, conduct training virtually so all can attend without gathering together. Place signs and visual reminders about prevention steps around work areas, including markers for keeping at least 6 feet apart.

Require staff and volunteers to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water before, frequently during, and after shifts. Use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren’t available.

Provide a handwashing break every 2 hours and allow staff and volunteers to wash their hands more frequently if they choose.

Provide staff and volunteers disposable gloves since they may be exchanging or handling products from other people, unclean produce, or sharp edges on product packages. Remind staff and volunteers to avoid touching their face while wearing gloves and to wash their hands before putting gloves on and after taking them off.

Require staff and volunteers to wear masks, unless they have trouble breathing or are otherwise unable to remove a mask without assistance. Provide information to all staff and volunteers on proper use and washing of masks. Employers should bring extra masks each day in case masks get wet or soiled and a sealable plastic bag to store used masks.

Provide options, as possible, for employees and volunteers to work remotely, especially if they are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Tasks that might be done remotely include contacting clients over the phone for assessments and scheduling and working virtually with suppliers and donors.

Limit the number of staff, volunteers, and clients at assigned times so that at least 6 feet of distance can be maintained between people.

Client Outreach

Food insecurity, even in the short-term, can have serious impacts on physical and mental health. During this difficult time, food pantry and food distribution sites are critical. Managers can provide safe and flexible options to help people with food insecurity while prioritizing the health and safety of clients, staff, and volunteers.",4/30/20 0:00,
Considerations for Outdoor Learning Gardens and Community Gardens,"These recommendations are intended for managers of outdoor learning gardens (e.g., school gardens) and community gardens. Outdoor learning gardens are often affiliated with schools and provide outdoor learning and access to healthy food for students. Community gardens are sections of land collectively gardened by a group of people to produce and share affordable fruits and vegetables within their communities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges across the United States. Access to healthy food options and nutrition are an important part of health and well-being. Outdoor learning and community gardens help fill nutritional gaps in places where access to healthy food may be limited, provide recreation and stress reduction opportunities, and provide a safe outdoor learning environment,external icon especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Garden managers should consider the recommendations below to help ensure a safe learning environment and access to healthy food, while helping prevent the spread of COVID-19.

These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which organizations must comply. Garden managers can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Garden managers should continually assess, based on current levels of spread in the community they serve, how to modify their garden operations.

Garden managers may also benefit from reviewing CDC’s COVID-19 guidance and considerations on community based organizations, workplaces, events and gatherings, food service providers, and CDC’s information on people at higher risk of severe illness .

Preventing the spread of COVID-19

Coronaviruses, such as the one that causes COVID-19, are thought to spread mostly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets emitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The droplets containing virus are spread in the air and can be inhaled in the lungs or land on the mouth, nose or eyes of people nearby. A person also might be exposed to the virus causing COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, including food or a shared tool, that has been contaminated when an infected person coughs or sneezes near it, and then touches their own mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Risk of transmission from food and shared tools is considered very low, but there are other, possible routes of COVID-19 spread, such as:

Being in close contact (within six feet) with others who do not live in the same household as you, especially people who do not wear masks. The more people you interact with, and the longer those interactions last, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread;

Contact with frequently touched surfaces (e.g., gate latches, hoses);

Touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your own mouth, nose, or eyes.

Outdoor activities generally are lower risk than indoor activities, but there are still important ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 that should be followed, including:

Promote healthy behaviors

Encourage people to stay at home when sick.

Staff, volunteers, and gardeners should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms , or have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of, or diagnosed with, COVID-19.

or have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of, or diagnosed with, COVID-19. Develop policies that encourage sick staff and volunteers to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure staff and volunteers are aware of these policies.

Educate staff and volunteers about when they should stay home and when it is safe to be around others.

Encourage people to socially distance.

Working at least six feet apart from others, even when you are outside, reduces the chance that you will be exposed to the virus from respiratory droplets emitted by others.

Many people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or no symptoms, but can still spread the virus to others. Staying apart reduces your risk of getting COVID-19.

Social distancing is most effective when it is used along with other prevention strategies, including wearing masks.

Masks

Require staff and volunteers to use masks, as feasible. Masks are an important means of reducing viral spread, and are essential when social distancing is difficult. Provide information to all staff and volunteers on proper use, removal, and washing of masks.

If feasible, provide masks for staff, volunteers, and gardeners, and consider asking them to bring extra masks, in case their mask gets wet or soiled, as well as a sealable plastic bag or other container to store masks when not in use.

Hand hygiene

Provide handwashing stations or hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol) for all gardeners, staff, and volunteers, if feasible. Ensure hand-hygiene options can be accessed by everyone.

Proper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure. Ensure employees and volunteers wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, provide an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. Hand sanitizers may not be as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy and might not remove harmful chemicals from hands like pesticides and heavy metals. Key times to clean hands in general include: Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating food After using the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing After touching frequently touched surfaces After putting on, touching, or removing masks After handling money After taking out the trash After gardening



Clear signage and communications

Ensure that all gardeners, staff, volunteers and the public are made aware of garden rules and hours. Post signs displaying hours of operation and safety precautions at each entrance to the garden and near shared areas and make the same information available on your website and social media platforms. Consider developing a communication plan that includes additional methods other than in-person or electronic communication only.

Post signs in highly visible locations (e.g., at building entrances, in restrooms) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread pdf icon of germs by properly washing hands and properly wearing a mask image icon .

of germs by properly washing hands and properly wearing a mask . Consider developing signs and messages in alternative formats (e.g., large print, Braille, American Sign Language) for people who have low vision or are blind or people who are deaf or hard of hearing or in other common languages spoken by members.

Maintain healthy environments

Modifications to promote social distancing should include:

Limiting the number of gardeners, staff, and volunteers at the garden to promote social distancing. Consider offering virtual education or other outreach activities to reduce crowding and extend garden opportunities for those who may not be able to physically visit the garden.

Encouraging all gardeners, staff, and volunteers to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from others, including in commonly shared spaces (e.g., handwashing stations).

Providing disinfecting wipes so that gardeners, staff and volunteers can wipe off tools between use.

Implementing one-way traffic flow in garden rows and other areas to promote social distancing, if possible.

Encouraging people to sign up in advance for community workdays or other events to decrease crowding.

Safe operations

Be aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to providing essential services and group gatherings to determine if your garden can be open to the public, and what rules apply, if any, regarding current restrictions limiting the number of attendees at events and/or shared spaces.

Limit non-essential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations, especially with those who are not from the local area, and consider what, if any, exceptions apply, such as allowing direct service providers or service animals that may assist people with disabilities.

Limit or suspend events or activities that target individuals identified as at higher risk for serious illness for COVID-19, and individuals who live with, or work with, people at increased risk, if feasible. If these events or activities continue to be offered, consider creating a schedule that includes special garden hours for at-risk or vulnerable populations.

Discourage people from eating and drinking in the garden and sharing food and beverages.

Cancel or postpone all taste-testing and cooking demo activities, if feasible.

Consider a regular training of staff, volunteers and gardeners so that they understand how COVID-19 is spread, how prevention strategies are helpful, and the specific prevention strategies that your garden has adopted and is promoting.

Consider regular symptom screenings of staff, volunteers and gardeners that come onsite, and have a plan for if anyone arrives or becomes ill. For guidance related to screening of staff, please refer to CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the “Prevent Transmission Among Employees” section of CDC’s Resuming Business Toolkit pdf icon .

. Ensure all water systems are safe to use, especially if re-opening garden facilities after a prolonged shut down.

Limit the use of traditional sign-up and sign-in sheets that require individuals to physically sign-in with a shared writing utensil. As feasible, use alternative methods, like phone calls or online scheduling platforms, to coordinate when staff, volunteers, and gardeners will be at the garden. If a shared writing utensil is used, ensure that it is frequently cleaned and disinfected. Ensure opportunities to sign-up for time in the garden are shared in an equitable fashion for all garden users.

Cleaning and disinfection

Follow CDC and EPA’s Guidance on Cleaning and Disinfection to prepare and maintain a safe environment for staff, volunteers, and gardeners. Use EPA List N-approved disinfectants against COVID-19pdf icon. Always read and follow label instructions for each product.

Routinely clean, sanitize, and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, such as entrance gate latches, portable toilets, water spigots, and hoses.

Consider limiting or suspending use of shared tools and equipment. Encourage gardeners to bring their own, if feasible. If using shared tools or equipment (hand tools, wheelbarrows, garden carts, tillers, etc.), ensure that they are cleaned and disinfected before and after use. You may consider scheduling more time than usual between groups of gardeners to ensure all high contact surfaces and shared equipment/tools are cleaned and disinfected.

If you have restrooms or port-a-potties available, set up a schedule to frequently clean and disinfect all surfaces, and replenish soap, sanitizers, or paper products.

Use disposable gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash: After using disposable gloves, throw them out in a lined trash can. Do not disinfect or reuse the gloves. Wash hands after removing gloves.

Ensure you have enough supplies for staff, volunteers, vendors, and customers to clean their hands and cover their coughs and sneezes. Supplies include soap, water, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, a way to dry hands, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch trash cans.

"COVID-19 Considerations for Animal Activities at Fairs, Shows, and Other Events","Fairs and agricultural shows pose unique One Health risks because they bring together crowds of people and animals with opportunities for close contact among them and mixing of different animals from different places. Events like these can contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person but may also pose a risk of infection to certain types of animals.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, show organizers should follow CDC’s Considerations for Events and Gatherings when deciding whether to hold, postpone, or cancel a fair, agricultural show, or other event where animals may be exhibited. Planners should also act in accordance with state and local jurisdictional guidance with regards to continuing operations at fair grounds or agricultural shows. For general disease prevention when interacting with animals, follow advice in the Compendium of Measures to Prevent Disease Associated with Animals in Public Settingspdf iconexternal icon, which provides standard recommendations on reducing the risk of disease related to animal contact in public settings for public health officials, veterinarians, animal venue operators, animal exhibitors (e.g., 4-H programs), visitors to animal venues and exhibits, teachers, camp operators, and others. Additional information and a checklist on biosecurity measures to prevent zoonotic diseases from spreading at fairs and animal exhibitions may be found in the NASPHV’s Resources on Zoonotic Influenzaexternal icon.

Fair and agricultural show organizers should consider the potential for COVID-19 to spread from person to person, person to animal, and possibly from animal to animal. The risk of animal-to-person spread is considered low. However, it appears that people can spread the virus to animals in some situations, usually during close contact. Event organizers should take precautions to minimize transmission of all zoonotic diseases between people and animals.

Some animals have been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, including pet cats and dogs in the United States. To date, there have been no reports of horses, cows, pigs, chickens, or ducks testing positive for SARS-COV-2. More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.

Precautions for animals

Although there have been no reports of livestock being infected with SARS-CoV-2, other types of animals have been infected. We are still learning about this virus and how it might affect different animals. Take precautions to prevent the potential spread of the virus among animals at your event.

Implement additional precautions to maintain at least 6 feet separation between any species shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, including cats and other felids; dogs; small mammals such as mink, ferrets, and rabbits; and other animals external icon shown to be susceptible to this virus. Prohibit susceptible animals from fairgrounds if they are not involved in fair or show activities. Prevent direct contact and institute policies to ensure at least 6 feet separation is maintained between these susceptible animals and other animals and between these animals and people. The number of exhibitors and animals that can safely fit in a show ring or exhibit area may limit the number of animals that can be shown at one time.

shown to be susceptible to this virus. Follow good biosecurity external icon practices to prevent the spread of pathogens between the fair and the farm. These include management practices on the farm, in transit, and at the destination. Biosecurity applies to both people and animals and includes these practices: Use good hand hygiene. Keep visitors on the farm to a minimum. Clean and disinfect all equipment, tools, and other items between uses. Wear proper attire and PPE when coming in to contact with animals or where they live. Monitor animals for signs of illness.

practices to prevent the spread of pathogens between the fair and the farm. These include management practices on the farm, in transit, and at the destination. Biosecurity applies to both people and animals and includes these practices: Do not allow admission of any animals that are sick. Animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a range of clinical signs including fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, runny nose, eye discharge, vomiting, or diarrhea. All animals should receive a screening examination from a veterinarian, veterinary technician, or experienced animal care and handling specialist before being allowed on the premises. Agricultural fairs may require a health certificate from a licensed veterinarian for each animal brought to fair grounds. Animals should be examined daily for signs of illness. Exhibitors should report sick animals to the fair veterinarian or designee immediately.

Prevent contact between pens of animals from different farms or households to prevent unnecessary interactions. Prevention may be accomplished by spacing out pens, staggering animals with an empty pen in between, or making other arrangements based on the facility.

Place pens and stalls in a manner that keeps the public at least 6 feet away from the animal.

Clean and disinfect animal areas frequently, including between uses for different animal species.

Use facilities that provide adequate ventilation for animals and people.

Limit interactions and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between animals and people and between people, including fair staff, judges, and the public who are not from the same farm or household as the animal or its caretaker.

Do not put masks on animals. Covering an animal’s face can harm it.

Do not wipe or bathe animals with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use.

Maintaining healthy environments in animal interaction areas

If the event will have a petting zoo or other animal interaction area, take precautions in addition to normal infectious disease prevention methods to protect animals and people from infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Do not permit animals that are at higher risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 in petting zoos or other animal interaction areas. This includes cats and other felids, small mammals like mink, ferrets and rabbits, and dogs.

Include hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit to petting zoos and other exhibits where people will be interacting with animals. Visitors should wash their hands before and after entering the area, even if they didn’t touch animals. Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations. If soap and water are not readily available, provide hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. If possible, staff should be assigned at the exit to actively encourage hand washing.

Visitors to animal areas should wear a mask inside the animal area, if able. Masks are not recommended for children under 2 years or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance.

Do not use common feed dispensers and other shared surfaces that cannot be cleaned and disinfected between uses.

Increase distance and limit the duration of contact (no more than 15 minutes) between visitors and between visitors and workers: People should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other. Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (e.g., guides for creating one-way routes). Eliminate lines or queues if possible or encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by providing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks When designing petting zoo and other animal interaction areas, allow for social distancing and avoid high densities of people. Provide separate entry and exit points for visitors so they do not need to pass close together while coming into and going out of the petting zoo.

Limit items allowed in the animal area. Do not allow strollers, food, backpacks, or other items in the animal area.

Do not allow visitors to share their food with animals.

Discourage visitors from kissing or snuggling with animals or sitting on the ground in animal areas.

Use EPA-approved disinfectants external icon against COVID-19 to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as door handles/gates and shared objects in petting zoos and animal interaction areas.

Livestock and horse shows

To maintain social distancing, consider the following steps:

Split classes to limit the number of animals in the show ring.

Cattle, horse, sheep, and goat shows naturally lend to social distancing when on the walk; adapt spacing to maintain distance between participants.

Limit the number of people and/or animals in a ring to ensure that at least 6 feet is kept between an animal and its handler and other people and animals including judges. The number of exhibitors and animals that can safely fit in a show ring or exhibit area may limit the number of animals that can be shown at one time.

Provide separate entry and exit points for visitors so they do not need to pass close together while coming into and going out of the ring.

Stagger activities in washing and grooming areas, or other shared spaces, so that animals from different farms or households do not interact unnecessarily and so that people can maintain a distance of at least 6 feet apart from each other.

Stagger animal move-in/move-out times to reduce contact between people and animals.

Consider a “show-and-go” with animals stalled at a trailer and leaving immediately after the show if this will not compromise animal welfare, for example, because of weather conditions such as high temperature and humidity.

Maintaining healthy operations

For information on maintaining healthy operations, see CDC’s Guidance for Businesses and Employers and Considerations for Events and Gatherings.",2/11/20 0:00,
Considerations for Owners and Operators of Multifamily Housing Including Populations at Increased Risk for Complications from COVID-19,"Multifamily housing (e.g., apartments, condominiums, townhouses, duplexes, and quadruplexes) pose a challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic due to potential for increased risk of exposure for residents and staff. The following guidance is provided to help owners, administrators, and operators of multifamily housing work together with residents, staff, and public health officials to create a safe living environment and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Public health actions needed to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing, can lead some people to feel isolated and lonely or can increase stress and anxiety. This page provides guidance in assessing and reducing exposure risks and resources for coping with stress in healthy ways.

These considerations are especially important for multifamily housing for older adults, residents living in settings that incorporate congregate or supportive services (e.g., multifamily housing that caters to older adults, low-income families, people with disabilities, etc.), and other populations who are at increased risk for acquiring COVID-19 and having complications. Other examples include individuals and families served through programs such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Public Housing Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly, Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilitiesexternal icon, and Project-Based Rental Assistanceexternal icon, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Multifamily Housing Rental Assistance Programexternal icon, or properties funded through the Low-Income Housing Tax Creditexternal icon program.

Guiding principles

Older adults and groups experiencing disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.

Other factors may increase an individual’s risk for severe illness, such as underlying medical conditions.

Although older adults and people with underlying conditions face particular risks, everyone should take steps to protect themselves from exposure to the virus causing COVID-19.

Communal spaces, community activities, and close living quarters in multifamily housing increase the risk of getting and spreading the virus

COVID-19 is mostly spread person-to-person through respiratory droplets released when people cough, sneeze, or talk. Less commonly, COVID-19 may also be acquired when someone touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their nose, mouth, or eyes. COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Therefore, personal prevention practices such as social distancing, using masks, frequent handwashing with soap and water or hand sanitizing when handwashing with soap and water is not possible, cough etiquette, and staying home when sick, are important to reduce COVID-19. Other environmental prevention practices, such as environmental cleaning and disinfection, are also important. Administrators can take clear-cut actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread in their communities and at their facilities.

Develop a plan

During an infectious disease outbreak, such as the current outbreak of COVID-19, property owners, administrators, and operators should prepare to identify residents at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, collaborate with their local health departments, and protect their employees’ health and safety.

See CDC’s guidance for preparing businesses and employees for the effects of COVID-19.

Consider the unique needs of your residents, such as disabilities, cognitive decline, or lack of access to technology. This guidance does not address infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. If your facility offers healthcare services, consult CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.

State, territorial, local, and tribal public health departments can provide specific information on COVID-19 transmission and policies in your community, which can help you decide when and if you need to scale up or relax specific prevention measures.

Promote behaviors that reduce spread

Encourage residents and staff to practice behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19. An individualized approach for COVID-19 may be needed for people with physical or intellectual disabilities or who have difficulty accessing information. Some residents require close contact with direct service providers, (e.g., home care nurses, therapists, social workers, etc.), have trouble understanding information, have difficulties with changes in routines, or have other concerns related to their disability.

Self-isolate or quarantine when appropriate

Encourage mask wearing

Encourage use of CDC-recommended masks among residents, workers, and visitors in common areas and in public.

Advise residents to avoid others who are not wearing masks or to ask others around them to wear masks.

Some residents may not be able to wear masks or are recommended not to wear masks: Wearing masks may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues. Masks should not be worn by children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Adaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading if it is not possible to wear one.

Encourage social distancing

In general, interacting with more people, especially closely and for longer times, increases risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

Avoid gatherings of 10 or more people.

Encourage social distancing by asking workers and residents who are not from the same household and visitors to stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart whenever possible. Social distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.

Avoid close contact with visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump or hug. Instead consider waving and verbal greetings.

Ensure adequate supplies in common areas

Support healthy hygiene behaviors by providing supplies, including soap, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, a way to dry hands, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans.

Display relevant signs and messages

Post signs in highly visible locations (e.g., building entrances, stairways, elevators) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread of germs (such as social distancing, by properly washing hands, proper cough etiquette, and properly wearing a mask).

Include messages (for example, videos, posters) about behaviors that prevent the spread of COVID-19 when communicating with residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors (such as on websites, in emails, in facility newsletters, and on social media accounts). Find free CDC print and digital resources on CDC’s communications resources main page. Identify and address potential language, cultural, and environmental barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information. Consider developing communication materials in alternative formats (e.g., large print, braille, ASL) for people who have low vision or are blind or people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Consider developing communication materials for people with low literacy and using plain or easy to understand language or visuals. Communications may need to be framed or adapted so they are culturally appropriate for your audience and easy to understand. CDC has communication resources available in many languages.



Maintain healthy environments in common areas

Multifamily housing complexes may consider several strategies to maintain healthy environments.

Ensure adequate ventilation

Consider conducting ventilation system upgrades or other steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants in the building. Obtain consultation from experienced Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) professionals when making changes to HVAC systems and equipment. Some of the recommendations below are based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon. Review additional ASHRAE guidelines for multifamily buildingsexternal icon for further information on ventilation recommendations for different types of building and building readiness for occupancy. Not all steps are applicable for all scenarios.

Improvement steps may include some or all of the following activities:

Increase outdoor air ventilation, using caution in highly polluted areas. Increase outdoor air by opening windows and doors, when weather conditions allow. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to persons using the facility. Use fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows. Position fans securely and carefully in or near windows to avoid potentially contaminated air flowing from one person to another. Strategic window fan placement in exhaust mode can help draw fresh air into room via other open windows and doors without generating strong room air currents. Decrease occupancy in common areas where outdoor ventilation cannot be increased.

Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and provide acceptable indoor air quality for the current occupancy level for each space.

Increase total airflow supply to occupied spaces, when possible.

Disable demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on occupancy or temperature during occupied hours.

Further open minimum outdoor air dampers to reduce or eliminate HVAC air recirculation. In mild weather, this will not affect thermal comfort or humidity; however, this may be difficult to do in cold, hot, or humid weather.

Improve central air filtration: Increase air filtration external icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow. Inspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass. Check filters to ensure they are within service life and appropriately installed.

Consider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after the space is occupied.

Ensure restroom exhaust fans are functional and operating at full capacity when the space is occupied.

Inspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as restrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, or other areas of high occupancy.

Use portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning, especially in higher risk areas such as common spaces.

to help enhance air cleaning, especially in higher risk areas such as common spaces. Generate clean-to-less-clean air movement by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers or dampers, especially in higher-risk areas such as common spaces.

Consider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation pdf icon external icon (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited.

*Note: The ventilation intervention considerations listed above come with a range of initial costs and operating costs. There are also risk assessment parameters to consider, such as community incidence rates, face mask compliance expectations, and common room density. These factors may affect which interventions are implemented.

Ensure safe water systems

Promote cleaning and disinfection

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., door handles, handicap door access switches, sink handles, grab bars, hand railings,) within common areas of facilities at least daily or between use as much as possible. Advise residents with sensory or respiratory issues to avoid these areas during and immediately after cleaning.

Limit use of shared objects in common areas (e.g., computer equipment, remote controls, print materials) when possible, and clean and disinfect shared objects between use.

Develop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.

Provide staff with training about the safe and correct use and storage of cleaners and disinfectants.

Use products that meet EPA List N disinfection criteria external icon . Use products according to the manufacturer’s labeled directions.

. Use products according to the manufacturer’s labeled directions. Encourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to keep personal items (e.g., cell phones, other electronics), and personal work and living spaces clean. Offer assistance with cleaning and disinfecting for residents with disabilities who may require supervision

Encourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to use disinfectant wipes to wipe down objects and surfaces before and after use.

Ensure safe congregate spaces

Modified layouts

Social distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.

Alter schedules to reduce mixing and close contact, such as staggering activity times and forming small groups that regularly participate at the same times and do not mix with individuals in other groups.

Arrange seating of chairs and tables to be at least 6 feet apart during events.

Minimize traffic in enclosed spaces, such as mailrooms, elevators, and stairwells.

Consider limiting the number of individuals in an elevator at one time and designating one-directional stairwells and hallways, if possible.

Ensure that social distancing can be maintained in communal spaces.

Physical barriers and guides

Install physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., reception areas).

Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart. Use formats that are accessible to residents, including for those with visual impairments.

Safe communal spaces

Social distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.

Close indoor shared spaces such as game rooms, computer rooms, exercise rooms, and lounges if needed to ensure safety of the residents.

Otherwise, stagger use and restrict the number of people allowed in at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart, and clean and disinfect between use.

Prioritize outdoor activities where possible.

Limit the presence of non-essential volunteers and visitors in shared areas, when possible.

Clean and disinfect common-area bathrooms regularly (e.g., in the morning and evening, after times of heavy use) using EPA List N-registered disinfectants external icon following the manufacturer’s labeled directions.

following the manufacturer’s labeled directions. Maintain access and adequate supplies to laundry facilities. Restrict the number of people allowed in laundry rooms at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart.

Consider closing exercise rooms. Alternatively, stagger use, increase air flow by opening windows where possible, and clean and disinfect between use.

Consider closing pools and hot tubs or limiting access to pools for essential activities only, such as water therapy. Consider additional prevention activities for public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds during COVID-19 for those that remain open.

Conduct maintenance and inspection visits

To the extent allowed by law or regulation consider:

Deferring maintenance inside units for non-critical or non-life-threatening problems.

Deferring routine in-unit inspections, especially for assisted units which may have regular mandatory inspections. Owners and operators of assisted units should be aware that authorities may have issued temporary waivers or guidance regarding inspections during the pandemic.

Maintain healthy operations

Multifamily housing complexes may consider several strategies to maintain healthy operations.

Protections for residents and workers at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Offer options for those at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions) that limit their exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities, virtual participation in community events).

Consistent with applicable law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions.

Regulatory awareness

Be aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to multifamily housing to determine if events or activities can be held.

Identify strategies to maintain operations and a healthy working and living environment

Review CDC’s guidance for businesses and employers.

Identify an onsite coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 issues and their impact at the workplace.

Develop flexible sick leave policies for staff. Require staff to stay home when sick, even without documentation from doctors. Use flexibility, when possible, to allow staff to stay home to care for sick family or household members or to care for children in the event of school or childcare dismissals. Make sure that employees are aware of and understand these policies.

Create plans to protect the staff and residents from the spread of COVID-19 and help them put in place personal preventive measures.

Clean and disinfect shared areas (such as exercise room, laundry facilities, shared bathrooms, and elevators) and frequently touched surfaces using EPA List N-registered disinfectants external icon more than once a day, if possible.

more than once a day, if possible. Identify services and activities (such as meal programs, in-person religious services, and exercise rooms and programs) that might need to be limited or temporarily discontinued. Consider alternative solutions (e.g., virtual services) that will help programs continue while being safe for residents.

Establish policies and practices for social distancing.

Identify a list of healthcare and mental health facilities and alternative care sites where residents with COVID-19 can receive appropriate care, if needed.

Communication systems

Identify platforms such as email, websites, hotlines, automated text messaging, newsletters, and flyers to help communicate information on:

Visitors, service providers, and prospective tenants

Loneliness and social isolation in older adults are serious health risk factors. However, because in-person social interactions are associated with increased risk of infection, owners and operators of multifamily communities are encouraged to promote safe social activities among community residents and their support networks.

Residents should be encouraged to limit visitors to persons essential to maintaining their health, well-being, and safety.

Visitors should avoid entering the building or community, including common areas and residences , unless their presence is essential to preserving the health, including mental health, well-being, and safety of residents. This can include a wide array of service providers or even community or family support networks of older adult residents.

, unless their presence is essential to preserving the health, including mental health, well-being, and safety of residents. This can include a wide array of service providers or even community or family support networks of older adult residents. Visitors, service providers, and prospective tenants should follow personal protective measures and the recommendations set forth by the facility they are visiting, as well as local and state health directives.

personal protective measures and the recommendations set forth by the facility they are visiting, as well as local and state health directives. Visitors should also maintain social distance of at least six feet (2 meters) from residents to help reduce transmission.

Visitors, service providers, and prospective tenants should not visit if they recently had contact with someone who had symptoms of COVID-19.

Visitors should wear a mask while in the building and restrict their visit to the resident’s room or other location designated by the facility. Everyone should be reminded to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol when handwashing with soap and water is not possible.

Unit turnover and move-ins

Follow CDC’s guidance on cleaning and disinfecting your home.

Safely clean units and assist with unit turnovers and move-out/ins by learning how to protect yourself and others.

New units (especially high-touch surfaces) should be cleaned and disinfected using a disinfectant from the list of EPA List N-registered disinfectants external icon . Follow the manufacturer’s labeled directions.

. Follow the manufacturer’s labeled directions. Wait at least 24 hours since previous tenants left before cleaning and disinfecting in preparation for a new individual/family moving in. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.

Additional suggestions include Frequent cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, and faucets, during the moving process; Limiting the number of family members present during the move-in/out process; Maintaining social distancing between household members and movers and other residents; Requesting the proper use of masks; Providing handwashing materials – ideally soap, water and a way to dry hands if water is on in the unit, or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol – and encouraging frequent hand hygiene; Keeping windows and doors open, if possible, to increase ventilation



Prepare for when someone gets sick

If a resident in your multifamily housing unit has COVID-19 (suspected or confirmed)

Have the resident contact a healthcare provider to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.

Residents are not required to notify administrators if they think they may have or have a confirmed case of COVID-19.

If you do receive information that someone in your housing unit has COVID-19, work with the local health department to notify anyone in the unit who may have been exposed (had close contact with the sick person) while maintaining the confidentiality of the sick person as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and, if applicable, the Fair Housing Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Provide the sick person with information on how to care for themselves and when to seek medical attention.

Help address misunderstandings about why people are being asked for personal information, and why this information is important for stopping spread of COVID-19 among family, friends, and communities.

Encourage residents with COVID-19 symptoms to self-isolate and their roommates and close contacts to quarantine. This includes limiting contact of residents with COVID-19 symptoms with any pets or service animals in the household or facility to protect them from possible infection.

Those with COVID-19 symptoms and their close contacts should limit their use of shared spaces as much as possible. Follow guidance on when to stop isolation and when to end quarantine.

Minimize the number of staff members who have face-to-face interactions with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

Encourage staff, other residents, caregivers such as outreach workers, and others who visit people with COVID-19 symptoms to follow recommended precautions to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.

Staff at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should not have close contact with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19, if possible.

Those who have been in close contact (less than 6 feet or 2 meters) with a resident for a total of 15 minutes or more who has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should monitor their health and call their healthcare provider if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.

Be prepared to provide accessible transportation to people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for testing or non-urgent medical care.

Avoid transporting people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis unless it is the only accessible option. Follow guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting any transport vehicles.

If multiple cases are suspected, contact the local public health department to report the cases and to offer to an accessible community testing site, provide a platform for information-sharing, or share community insights.

Clean and disinfect

Close off areas used by someone that has or may have COVID-19 and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting.

Wait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting.

If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.

Provide staff with training about the safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection products, including storing products securely away from children and pets.

Watch for symptoms in residents and their family members

People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:

Fever or chills

Cough

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Fatigue

Muscle or body aches

Headache

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Congestion or runny nose

Nausea or vomiting

Diarrhea

This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19.

In some cases, older adults and people of any age with underlying health conditions may have symptoms that are not typically seen in others, or they may take longer than others to develop fever and other symptoms.

When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If a resident is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately: Trouble breathing

Persistent pain or pressure in the chest

New confusion

Inability to wake or stay awake

Bluish lips or face * This list does not include all possible symptoms. Call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.

Additional CDC resources to help prevent spread of COVID-19 in multifamily housing

More detailed guidance is available for specific types of facilities. Some of the information in these guidance documents is applicable to that specific type of facility only, and some of the information would be applicable to other congregate housing facilities.",4/30/20 0:00,
People Experiencing Homelessness,"People experiencing unsheltered homelessness (those sleeping outside or in places not meant for human habitation) may be at risk for infection when there is community spread of COVID-19. This interim guidance is intended to support response to COVID-19 by local and state health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, emergency planners, healthcare facilities, and homeless outreach services. Homeless shelters and other facilities should also refer to the Interim Guidance for Homeless Shelters. Community and faith-based organizations can refer to the Interim Guidance for Communities of Faith for other information related to their staff and organizations.

COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus. We are learning about how it spreads, how severe it is, and other features of the disease.

Lack of housing contributes to poor physical and mental health outcomes, and linkages to permanent housing for people experiencing homelessness should continue to be a priority. In the context of COVID-19 spread and transmission, the risks associated with sleeping outdoors or in an encampment setting are different than from staying indoors in a congregate setting such as an emergency shelter or other congregate living facility. Outdoor settings may allow people to increase physical distance between themselves and others. However, sleeping outdoors often does not provide protection from the environment, adequate access to hygiene and sanitation facilities, or connection to services and healthcare. The balance of risks should be considered for each individual experiencing unsheltered homelessness.

Community coalition-based COVID-19 prevention and response

Planning and response to COVID-19 transmission among people experiencing homelessness requires a “whole community”external icon approach, which means involving partners in the response plan development, with clearly outlined roles and responsibilities. Table 1 outlines some of the activities and key partners to consider for a whole-community approach.

Table 1: Using a community-wide approach to prepare for COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness

table 1 Connect to community-wide planning Connect with key partners to make sure that you can all easily communicate with each other while preparing for and responding to cases. A community coalition focused on COVID-19 planning and response should include: Local and state health departments

Outreach teams and street medicine providers

Homeless service providers and Continuum of Care leadership

Emergency management

Law enforcement

Healthcare providers

Housing authorities

Local government leadership

Other support services like case management, emergency food programs, syringe service programs, and behavioral health support

People with lived experiences of homelessness People with lived experiences of homelessness can help with planning and response. These individuals can serve as peer navigators to strengthen outreach and engagement efforts. Develop an advisory board with representation from people with current or former experiences of homelessness to ensure community plans are effective. Identify additional sites and resources Continuing homeless services during community spread of COVID-19 is critical. Make plans to maintain services for all people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Furthermore, clients who are positive for COVID-19 need to have access to services and a safe place to stay, separated from others who are not infected. To facilitate the continuation of services, community coalitions should identify resources to support people sleeping outside as well as additional temporary housing, including sites with individual rooms that are able to provide appropriate services, supplies, and staffing. These sites should include: Overflow sites to accommodate shelter decompression and higher shelter demands

Isolation sites for people who are confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 by laboratory testing

Quarantine sites for people who are awaiting testing, awaiting test results, or who were exposed to COVID-19

Protective housing for people who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 Depending on resources and staff availability, housing options that have individual rooms (such as hotels/motels) and separate bathrooms should be considered for the overflow, quarantine, and protective housing sites. In addition, plan for how to connect clients to housing opportunities after they have completed their stay in these temporary sites.

Communication

Outreach workers and other community partners, such as emergency food provision programs or law enforcement, can help ensure people sleeping outside have access to updated information about COVID-19 and access to services.

Stay updated on the local level of transmission of COVID-19 through your local external icon and state health departments.

and state health departments. Build on existing partnerships with peer navigators who can help communicate with others.

Maintain up-to-date contact information and areas frequented for each person.

Communicate clearly with people sleeping outside. Use health messages and materials developed by credible public health sources, such as your local and state public health departments or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Post signs in strategic places (e.g. near handwashing facilities) providing instruction on hand washing and cough etiquette pdf icon . Provide educational materials about COVID-19 for non-English speakers, those with low literacy or intellectual disabilities, and people who are hearing or vision impaired. Ensure communication with clients about changes in homeless services policies and/or changes in physical location of services such as food, water, hygiene facilities, regular healthcare, and behavioral health resources.

Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to workers, volunteers, and those you serve. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures.

Considerations for outreach staff

Staff training and policies

Provide training and educational materials related to COVID-19 for staff.

Minimize the number of staff members who have face-to-face interactions with clients.

Develop and use contingency plans for increased absenteeism caused by employee illness or by illness in employees’ family members. These plans might include extending hours, cross-training current employees, or hiring temporary employees.

Assign outreach staff who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 to duties that do not require them to interact with clients in person.

Outreach staff should review stress and coping resources for themselves and their clients during this time.

Staff prevention measures

Encourage outreach staff to maintain good hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol) on a regular basis, including before and after each client interaction

Advise staff to maintain 6 feet of distance while interacting with clients and other staff, where possible.

Require outreach staff to wear masks when working in public settings or interacting with clients. They should still maintain a distance of 6 feet from each other and clients, even while wearing masks.

Advise outreach staff to avoid handling client belongings. If staff are handling client belongings, they should use disposable gloves, if available. Make sure to train any staff using gloves to ensure proper use and ensure they perform hand hygiene before and after use. If gloves are unavailable, staff should perform hand hygiene immediately after handling client belongings.

Outreach staff who are checking client temperatures should use a system that creates a physical barrier between the client and the screener as described here. Where possible, screeners should remain behind a physical barrier, such as a car window, that can protect the staff member’s face from respiratory droplets that may be produced if the client sneezes, coughs, or talks. If social distancing or barrier/partition controls cannot be put in place during screening, PPE (i.e., facemask, eye protection [goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face], and a single pair of disposable gloves) can be used when within 6 feet of a client. However, given PPE shortages, training requirements, and because PPE alone is less effective than a barrier, try to use a barrier whenever you can.

For street medicine or other healthcare staff who are providing medical care to clients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and close contact (within 6 feet) cannot be avoided, staff should at a minimum, wear eye protection (goggles or face shield), an N95 or higher level respirator (or a facemask if respirators are not available or staff are not fit tested), disposable gown, and disposable gloves. Masks are not PPE and should not be used when a respirator or facemask is indicated. Healthcare providers should follow infection control guidelines.

Healthcare providers should follow infection control guidelines. Outreach staff who do not interact closely (e.g., within 6 feet) with sick clients and do not clean client environments do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).

Outreach staff should launder work uniforms or clothes after use using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.

Staff process for outreach

In the process of conducting outreach, staff should Greet clients from a distance of 6 feet and explain that you are taking additional precautions to protect yourself and the client from COVID-19. If the client is not wearing a mask, provide them with one. Screen clients for symptoms by asking them if they feel as if they have a fever, cough, or other symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Children have similar symptoms to adults and generally have mild illness Older adults and persons with medical comorbidities may have delayed presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms. If medical attention is necessary, use standard outreach protocols to facilitate access to healthcare. Continue conversations and provision of information while maintaining 6 feet of distance. If at any point you do not feel that you are able to protect yourself or your client from the spread of COVID-19, discontinue the interaction and notify your supervisor. Examples include if the client declines to wear a mask or if you are unable to maintain a distance of 6 feet.



Considerations for people experiencing unsheltered homelessness

Help clients prevent becoming sick with COVID-19

Consider the balance of these risks when addressing options for decreasing COVID-19 spread. Those who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness face several risks to their health and safety.

Continued linkage to homeless services, housing, medical, mental health, syringe services, and substance use treatment, including provision of medication-assisted therapies (e.g., buprenorphine, methadone maintenance, etc.). Use telemedicine, when possible.

Some people who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness may be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to older age or certain underlying medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease or serious heart conditions. Reach out to these clients regularly to ensure they are linked to care as necessary. Prioritize providing individual rooms for these clients, where available.

Recommend that all clients wear masks any time they are around other people. Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Provide clients with hygiene materials, where available.

Discourage clients from spending time in crowded places or gathering in large groups, for example at locations where food, water, or hygiene supplies are being distributed. If it is not possible for clients and staff to avoid crowded places, encourage spreading out (at least6 feet between people) to the extent possible and wearing masks.



Help link sick clients to medical care

Regularly assess clients for symptoms. Clients who have symptoms may or may not have COVID-19. Make sure they have a place they can safely stay in coordination with local health authorities. If available, a nurse or other clinical staff can help with clinical assessments. These clinical staff should follow personal protective measures. Provide anyone who presents with symptoms with a mask. Facilitate access to non-urgent medical care as needed. Use standard outreach procedures to determine whether a client needs immediate medical attention. Emergency signs include (this list is not all inclusive. Please refer clients for medical care for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you): Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion or inability to arouse Bluish lips or face Notify the designated medical facility and personnel to transfer that clients might have COVID-19.

If a client has tested positive for COVID-19 Use standard outreach procedures to determine whether a client needs immediate medical attention. If immediate medical attention is not required, facilitate transportation to an isolation site. Notify designated medical facility and personnel that the client has tested positive for COVID-19. If medical care is not necessary, and if no other isolation options are available, advise the individual on how to isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support. During isolation, ensure continuation of behavioral health support for people with substance use or mental health disorders. In some situations, for example due to severe untreated mental illness, an individual may not be able to comply with isolation recommendations. In these cases, community leaders should consult local health authorities to determine alternative options. Ensure the client has a safe location to recuperate (e.g., respite care) after isolation requirements are completed, and follow-up to ensure medium- and long-term medical needs are met.



Considerations for encampments

If individual housing options are not available, allow people who are living unsheltered or in encampments to remain where they are. Clearing encampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This increases the potential for infectious disease spread.

Encourage those staying in encampments to set up their tents/sleeping quarters with at least 12 feet x 12 feet of space per individual. If an encampment is not able to provide sufficient space for each person, allow people to remain where they are but help decompress the encampment by linking those at increased risk for severe illness to individual rooms or safe shelter.

Work together with community coalition members to improve sanitation in encampments.

Ensure nearby restroom facilities have functional water taps, are stocked with hand hygiene materials (soap, drying materials) and bath tissue, and remain open to people experiencing homelessness 24 hours per day.

If toilets or handwashing facilities are not available nearby, assist with providing access to portable latrines with handwashing facilities for encampments of more than 10 people. These facilities should be equipped with hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol).

Interim Guidance for Homeless Service Providers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"People experiencing homelessness are at risk for infection during community spread of COVID-19. This interim guidance is intended to support response planning by emergency management officials, public health authorities, and homeless service providers, including overnight emergency shelters, day shelters, and meal service providers.

COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus. We are learning about how it spreads, how severe it is, and other features of the disease. Transmission of COVID-19 in your community could cause illness among people experiencing homelessness, contribute to an increase in emergency shelter usage, and/or lead to illness and absenteeism among homeless service provider staff.

Early and sustained action to slow the spread of COVID-19 will keep staff and volunteers healthy, and help your organization maintain normal operations.

Community coalition-based COVID-19 prevention and response

Planning and response to COVID-19 transmission among people experiencing homelessness requires a “whole community”external icon approach, which means that you are involving partners in the development of your response planning, and that everyone’s roles and responsibilities are clear. Table 1 outlines some of the activities and key partners to consider for a whole-community approach.

Table 1: Using a community-wide approach to prepare for COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness

table 1 Connect to community-wide planning Connect with key partners to make sure that you can all easily communicate with each other while preparing for and responding to cases. A community coalition focused on COVID-19 planning and response should include: Local and state health departments

Homeless service providers and Continuum of Care leadership

Emergency management

Law enforcement

Healthcare providers

Housing authorities

Local government leadership

Other support services like outreach, case management, and behavioral health support Identify additional sites and resources Continuing homeless services during community spread of COVID-19 is critical, and homeless shelters should not close or exclude people who are having symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 without a plan for where these clients can safely access services and stay.

Decisions about whether clients with mild illness due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should remain in a shelter, or be directed to alternative housing sites, should be made in coordination with local health authorities. Community coalitions should identify additional temporary housing and shelter sites that are able to provide appropriate services, supplies, and staffing.Ideally, these additional sites should include: Overflow sites to accommodate shelter decompression (to reduce crowding) and higher shelter demands

Isolation sites for people who are confirmed to be positive for COVID-19

Quarantine sites for people who are waiting to be tested, or who know that they were exposed to COVID-19

Protective housing for people who are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 Depending on resources and staff availability, non-group housing options (such as hotels/motels) that have individual rooms should be considered for the overflow, quarantine, and protective housing sites. In addition, plan for how to connect clients to housing opportunities after they have completed their stay in these temporary sites.

Communication

Stay updated on the local level of transmission of COVID-19 through your local and state health departments.

Communicate clearly with staff and clients. Use health messages and materials developed by credible public health sources, such as your local and state public health departments or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Post signs at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on hand washing and cough pdf icon [1 page] etiquette, use of masks, and social distancing. Provide educational materials about COVID-19 for non-English speakers or hearing impaired, as needed. Keep staff and clients up-to-date on changes in facility procedures. Ensure communication with clients and key partners about changes in program policies and/or changes in physical location.

Identify platforms for communications such as a hotline, automated text messaging, or a website to help disseminate information to those inside and outside your organization. Learn more about communicating to workers in a crisis external icon .

. Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to workers, volunteers, and those you serve. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures.

Supplies

Have supplies on hand for staff, volunteers, and those you serve, such as:

Soap

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol

Tissues

Trash baskets

Masks

Cleaning supplies

Personal protective equipment (PPE), as needed by staff (see below)

Staff considerations

Provide training and educational materials related to COVID-19 for staff and volunteers.

Minimize the number of staff members who have face-to-face interactions with clients with respiratory symptoms.

Develop and use contingency plans for increased absenteeism caused by employee illness or by illness in employees’ family members. These plans might include extending hours, cross-training current employees, or hiring temporary employees.

Staff and volunteers who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should not be designated as caregivers for sick clients who are staying in the shelter. Identify flexible job duties for these increased risk staff and volunteers so they can continue working while minimizing direct contact with clients.

Put in place plans on how to maintain social distancing (remaining at least 6 feet apart) between all clients and staff while still providing necessary services.

All staff should wear a mask for source control (when someone wears a mask over their mouth and nose to contain respiratory droplets), consistent with the guidance for the general public. See below for information on laundering washable masks.

Staff who do not interact closely (e.g., within 6 feet) with sick clients and do not clean client environments do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).

Staff should avoid handling client belongings. If staff are handling client belongings, they should use disposable gloves, if available. Make sure to train any staff using gloves to ensure proper use and ensure they perform hand hygiene before and after use. If gloves are unavailable, staff should perform hand hygiene immediately after handling client belongings.

Staff who are checking client temperatures should use a system that creates a physical barrier between the client and the screener as described here. Screeners should stand behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition that can protect the staff member’s face from respiratory droplets that may be produced if the client sneezes, coughs, or talks. If social distancing or barrier/partition controls cannot be put in place during screening, PPE (i.e., facemask, eye protection [goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face], and a single pair of disposable gloves) can be used when within 6 feet of a client. However, given PPE shortages, training requirements, and because PPE alone is less effective than a barrier, try to use a barrier whenever you can.

For situations where staff are providing medical care to clients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and close contact (within 6 feet) cannot be avoided, staff should at a minimum, wear eye protection (goggles or face shield), an N95 or higher level respirator (or a facemask if respirators are not available or staff are not fit tested), disposable gown, and disposable gloves. Cloth face coverings are not PPE and should not be used when a respirator or facemask is indicated. If staff have direct contact with the client, they should also wear gloves. Infection control guidelines for healthcare providers are outlined here.

If staff have direct contact with the client, they should also wear gloves. Infection control guidelines for healthcare providers are outlined here. Staff should launder work uniforms or clothes after use using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.

Provide resources for stress and coping to staff. Learn more about mental health and coping during COVID-19.

Facility layout considerations

Use physical barriers to protect staff who will have interactions with clients with unknown infection status (e.g., check-in staff). For example, install a sneeze guard at the check-in desk or place an additional table between staff and clients to increase the distance between them to at least 6 feet.

In meal service areas, create at least 6 feet of space between seats, and/or allow either for food to be delivered to clients or for clients to take food away.

In general sleeping areas (for those who are not experiencing respiratory symptoms), try to make sure client’s faces are at least 6 feet apart. Align mats/beds so clients sleep head-to-toe.

For clients with mild respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19: Prioritize these clients for individual rooms. If individual rooms are not available, consider using a large, well-ventilated room. Keep mats/beds at least 6 feet apart. Use temporary barriers between mats/beds, such as curtains. Align mats/beds so clients sleep head-to-toe. If possible, designate a separate bathroom for these clients. If areas where these clients can stay are not available in the facility, facilitate transfer to a quarantine site.

For clients with confirmed COVID-19, regardless of symptoms: Prioritize these clients for individual rooms. If more than one person has tested positive, these clients can stay in the same area. Designate a separate bathroom for these clients. Follow CDC recommendations for how to prevent further spread in your facility. If areas where these clients can stay are not available in the facility, assist with transfer to an isolation site.



Facility ventilation considerations

Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and per established local/national codes. Increase the indoor delivery of outdoor air as much as possible. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to clients, staff, volunteers, or visitors using the facility.

Consider taking steps to improve ventilation in the building, in consultation with an HVAC professional, based on local environmental conditions (temperature/humidity) and ongoing community transmission in the area. Identifying the best steps for your specific facility will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to layout, number of occupants, environmental factors, and available resources. Potential steps include: Increase the percentage of outdoor air (e.g., using economizer modes of HVAC operations) potentially as high as 100% (first verify compatibility with HVAC system capabilities for both temperature and humidity control as well as compatibility with outdoor/indoor air quality considerations). Increase total airflow supply to occupied spaces, if possible. Disable demand-control ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on temperature or occupancy. Consider using natural ventilation (i.e., opening windows if possible and safe to do so) to increase outdoor air dilution of indoor air when environmental conditions and building requirements allow. If temperatures outside make it difficult to leave multiple windows open, consider safely securing window fans or box fans (sealing the perimeter around the box fan) to blow air out of selected windows. The resulting make-up air will come into the building via multiple leak points and blend with indoor air as opposed to a single unconditioned incoming air stream. Improve central air filtration: Increase air filtration external icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow. Inspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass. Consider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after occupied times. Generate clean-to-less-clean air movements pdf icon external icon by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers and adjusting zone supply and exhaust flow rates to establish observable pressure differentials. Have staff work in “clean” ventilation zones that do not include higher-risk areas such as visitor reception or exercise facilities (if open). Careful placement of window exhaust fans can also assist in establishing directional airflow.

Consider using portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning pdf icon external icon (especially in higher-risk areas). HEPA systems not only capture and remove potentially infectious particles in the air but their clean air discharge is just as beneficial as fresh outdoor air when it comes to diluting contaminants.

(especially in higher-risk areas). HEPA systems not only capture and remove potentially infectious particles in the air but their clean air discharge is just as beneficial as fresh outdoor air when it comes to diluting contaminants. Ensure exhaust fans in kitchens and restroom facilities are functional and operating at full capacity when the building is occupied. Consider running exhaust fans for several hours before and after occupied times when possible.

Consider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) pdf icon external icon as a supplemental technique to inactivate potential airborne virus in the upper-room air of common occupied spaces. Seek consultation with a reputable UVGI manufacturer or an experienced UVGI system designer prior to installing and operating UVGI systems.

Facility procedure considerations

Plan to maintain regular operations to the extent possible.

Limit visitors who are not clients, staff, or volunteers.

Do not require a negative COVID-19 viral test for entry to a homeless services site unless otherwise directed by local or state health authorities.

Identify clients who could be at increased risk for complications from COVID-19, or from other chronic or acute illnesses, and encourage them to take extra precautions.

Arrange for continuity of and surge support for mental health, substance use treatment services, and general medical care.

Identify a designated medical facility to refer clients who might have COVID-19.

Keep in mind that clients and staff might be infected without showing symptoms. Create a way to make physical distancing between clients and staff easier, such as staggering meal services or having maximum occupancy limits for common rooms and bathrooms. All clients should wear masks any time they are not in their room or on their bed/mat (in shared sleeping areas). Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Regularly assess clients and staff for symptoms. Clients who have symptoms may or may not have COVID-19. Make sure they have a place they can safely stay within the shelter or at an alternate site in coordination with local health authorities. An on-site nurse or other clinical staff can help with clinical assessments. Provide anyone who presents with symptoms with a mask. Facilitate access to non-urgent medical care as needed. Use standard facility procedures to determine whether a client needs immediate medical attention. Emergency signs include: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion or inability to arouse Bluish lips or face Notify the designated medical facility and personnel to transfer clients that the client might have COVID-19.

Prepare healthcare clinic staff to care for patients with COVID-19, if your facility provides healthcare services, and make sure your facility has supply of personal protective equipment pdf icon [1 page] .

. Provide links to respite (temporary) care for clients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 but have been discharged. Some of these clients will still require isolation to prevent transmission. Some of these clients will no longer require isolation and can use normal facility resources.

Make sure bathrooms and other sinks are consistently stocked with soap and drying materials for handwashing. Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol at key points within the facility, including registration desks, entrances/exits, and eating areas.

Washable masks used by clients and staff should be laundered regularly. Disposable masks should not be laundered. Staff involved in laundering masks should do the following: Masks should be collected in a sealable container (like a trash bag). Staff should wear disposable gloves and a face mask. Use of a disposable gown is also recommended, if available. Gloves should be properly removed and disposed of after laundering washable masks; clean hands immediately after removal of gloves by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at least daily and shared objects between use using an EPA- registered disinfectant external icon .

Screening Clients for COVID-19 at Homeless Shelters or Encampments,"The following is a screening tool that can be used to identify people with possible symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although not every person who has symptoms will have COVID-19, conducting daily screenings consisting of a series of simple questions can help identify people who may need medical care or isolation.

If someone screens positive for symptoms, they should be directed to where they can stay according to a predesignated plan developed with the local Continuum of Care (CoC), public health department, and community leadership. For more details, see the Interim Guidance for Homeless Service Providers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Interim Guidance on Unsheltered Homelessness and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for Homeless Service Providers and Local Officials.

Determine if the client has a fever, by: Taking their temperature using a temporal thermometer (see box), AND Asking “Have you felt like you had a fever in the past day?”

Ask the client “Do you have a new or worsening cough today?” Ask the client, “Do you have any of these other symptoms? Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Fatigue

Muscle or body aches

Headache

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Congestion or runny nose

Nausea or vomiting

Diarrhea

If the client has a fever OR a new/worsening cough OR any of the other symptoms:

Provide a mask for the client to wear over their nose and mouth, if one is available and if the client can tolerate it. If a mask is not available, advise the client about cough etiquette and provide tissues. Masks should not be placed on children younger than 2 years old, anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, anyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Notify management and appropriate healthcare providers. Direct the client to an isolation room if available, or to the area designated for persons with symptoms of COVID-19. If your shelter does not have an area for people with symptoms, redirect the person to the location prespecified by your CoC, public health department, and community leadership. Let the client know: If their symptoms worsen, they should notify a member of the homeless shelter staff immediately.

They should not leave their room/the designated area except to use the restroom and they should stay at least 6 feet away from others.

If they leave their room/the designated area, they must wear a mask.

They should wash their hands often or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

CDC is a non-regulatory agency; therefore, the information in this document is meant to assist health departments and homeless service providers in making decisions rather than establishing regulatory requirements.

Homeless service provider sites and encampments can present unique challenges for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) investigations and public health action. In congregate settings such as homeless shelters, the virus may spread easily among clients, staff, and volunteers. Additionally, many people experiencing homelessness are older adults or have underlying medical conditions [1], [2], which are risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19. This document describes testing strategies for homeless shelters and encampments. Testing to diagnose COVID-19 is one strategy and should be used in conjunction with promoting behaviors that reduce spread, maintaining healthy environments, maintaining healthy operations, and preparing for when someone gets sick.

State, Tribal, territorial, and local health departments should review these considerations in the context of local recommendations, resources, acceptability, and feasibility. These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any federal, state, local, territorial, or Tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations. For details on appropriate procedures and safety measures and personal protective equipment to use during testing, see procedure for testing in congregate settings.

The purpose and process of all testing and other public health activities should be clearly communicated to clients and staff at the homeless service site to promote understanding and acceptability. Testing strategies should be carried out in a way that protects privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible and that is consistent with applicable laws and regulations. In addition to state and local laws, regulations and policies, site administrators should follow guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionexternal icon when offering testing to staff.

Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"How to Protect Yourself and Others from COVID-19

COVID-19 is the short name for “coronavirus disease 2019.” It is caused by a new virus that is mainly spread from person to person. Doctors and scientists are still learning about it. Recently, this virus has made many people sick. Here’s what you need to know to help protect yourself and people you care about from COVID-19.

Stay in touch with your case workers, group home staff, or shelter staff. They can help you to know what’s happening with COVID-19 in your community.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If you don’t have soap and water, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol . Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

with unwashed hands. You can get sick from other people who are sick, so try to stay away from them as much as possible. Help them get to medical care if they need it.

Avoid hanging out in groups. If you need to be in a group, stay at least two arms lengths (6 feet) from other people.

Wear a mask Masks are not for children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is not awake or can’t take the mask off by themselves. See more information on masks.

Stay connected even if you have to be apart. If you feel sad, lonely, scared, or anxious, reach out for help from a counselor or case worker or call the youth homelessness hotline at: 1-888-373-7888. Reach out to your family, friends, and case workers on the phone or online if possible. Use a buddy system to make sure you and your friends are safe.

Be aware that there might be changes in locations or hours of operation for food, housing, mental health, substance use, and health care services.

If you get sick

Some of the symptoms of COVID-19 are cough, a hard time breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell. If you have any of these symptoms, let someone (like a case worker) know so you can get help if needed.

If your symptoms get worse (like you have trouble breathing or pain/pressure in your chest, confusion or bluish lips or face), call 911 or get immediate help from a doctor.

Whenever you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash.

Continue to wear a mask when you are around other people.

Ask for help from case workers, group home staff, or shelter staff to find a safe place to stay while you get better.

Interim Considerations for SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Correctional and Detention Facilities,"Note: This document is intended to provide considerations on the appropriate use of testing and does not dictate the determination of payment decisions or insurance coverage of such testing, except as may be otherwise referenced (or prescribed) by another entity or federal or state agency. CDC is a non-regulatory agency; therefore, the information in this document is meant to assist correctional and detention facilities in making decisions rather than establishing regulatory requirements.

Correctional and detention facilities can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement the following proposed testing strategies. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, and acceptable, and should be tailored to the needs of each facility. These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which facilities must comply.

CDC offers considerations for correctional and detention facilities to plan, prepare, and respond to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities. Testing to diagnose COVID-19 is one component of a comprehensive strategy and should be used in conjunction with a number of other prevention and mitigation activities described in the interim guidance.

Testing symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and initiating medical isolation for suspected and confirmed cases and quarantine for close contacts (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more) can help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in correctional and detention facilities. This page provides considerations for implementing SARS-CoV-2 testing among incarcerated and detained persons and facility staff. Any time a positive test result is identified, ensure that the individual is rapidly notified, connected to appropriate medical care, and medical isolation is initiated. See CDC’s Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities for further details related to responding to cases. Correctional and detention facilities should follow guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionexternal icon when instituting and offering testing to staff, and when staff are preparing to return to work. Note that symptom screening, testing, and contact tracing strategies should be carried out in a way that protects privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible and that is consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

Types of COVID-19 tests

Viral tests are recommended to diagnose current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Viral tests evaluate whether the virus is present in a respiratory sample. Results from viral tests help identify and isolate people who are infected in order to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Antibody tests are used to detect a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. CDC does not currently recommend using antibody testing as the sole basis for diagnosing current infection. Depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it is currently not proven whether a positive antibody test indicates protection against future SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore, antibody tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune.

CDC recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing are based on what is currently known about the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is new, and what is known about it changes rapidly. Information on testing for SARS-CoV-2 will be updated as more information becomes available.

When testing might be needed

This page describes three scenarios when incarcerated or detained persons (IDP) or staff in correctional and detention facilities may need to have an initial SARS-CoV-2 viral test:

Testing individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19

Testing asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission

Testing asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification

This page also outlines considerations for planning broad-based testing in correctional and detention facilities (i.e., testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons), including:

Practical considerations for implementing broad testing for SARS-CoV-2 in correctional and detention facilities

Checklist of considerations to help facilities make decisions about how and when to test broadly for SARS-CoV-2

These considerations are intended to provide evidence-based strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing among IDP and staff who work in correctional and detention facilities. Depending on the context, specific testing considerations may be applied to IDP, staff, or both.

Testing individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19

Consistent with CDC’s recommendations, individuals (including staff and IDP) with COVID-19 signs or symptoms should be referred to a healthcare provider for evaluation for testing.

One strategy to identify individuals with COVID-19 signs or symptoms and to help lower the risk of transmission is to conduct temperature screening and/or symptom checks. To identify individuals with symptoms, facilities should integrate temperature screening and symptom checks into their standard practices (i.e., among IDP at intake, prior to discharge/release or transfer; daily staff screening; screening of volunteers and vendors upon entry). Screenings should be conducted safely and respectfully and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. See guidance on how to conduct temperature screening and symptom checks in the Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities.

Note that symptom screenings cannot identify individuals with COVID-19 who may be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, and therefore will not prevent all individuals with COVID-19 from entering the facility.

Testing asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission

Testing is recommended for all close contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection:

Broader testing strategy beyond close contacts

Congregate living or working conditions, such as in correctional and detention facilities, have potential for rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Performing contact tracing in correctional and detention settings may be resource-intensive and challenging (e.g., the number of close contacts of infected IDP in a housing unit with a dormitory-style sleeping area and shared restrooms and shower facilities may be large; outside public health staff conducting contact tracing may have limited access to correctional and detention facilities, and it may be necessary to conduct interviews with cases and close contacts over the phone). If contact tracing is not practicable, or if there is concern for widespread transmission following identification of new-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection among IDP or staff, facility management should consider a broader testing strategy, beyond testing only close contacts within the facility, to reduce the chances of a large outbreak.

Practical considerations for implementing a broader testing strategy should include the availability of resources and the ability to act on results of testing. Decisions about testing strategies in correctional and detention facilities should be made in collaboration with state/local health departments.

Depending on fac­ility characteristics and available resources, targeted (e.g., a specific housing unit) or facility-wide testing should be considered if a single IDP or staff member in the facility tests positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Incoming IDPs testing positive at intake should be placed immediately into medical isolation and provided medical care. As long as these individuals have not yet been in contact with the rest of the facility’s population, this circumstance would not trigger broader testing,

Quarantine and additional testing for close contacts

All persons who are close contacts of someone with COVID-19 (e.g., IDP and staff assigned to the housing unit where someone tested positive for SARS-CoV-2) should be provided with cloth face coverings (if not already wearing them, and unless contraindicated), and the IDP should be placed under quarantine restrictions for 14 days after their last exposure.

Staff

Management should consider requiring asymptomatic staff who have been identified as close contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case to home quarantine to the maximum extent possible, while understanding the need to maintain adequate staffing levels of critical workers. Workers in critical infrastructure sectors (including correctional and detention facilities) may be permitted to work if they remain asymptomatic after a potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, provided that worker infection prevention recommendations and controls are implemented, including requiring the staff member to wear a cloth face covering (unless contraindicated) at all times while in the workplace for 14 days after the last exposure (if not already wearing one due to universal use of cloth face coverings).

If the exposed staff members test positive, they should follow local health department and health care provider instructions regarding home isolation.

Incarcerated or detained persons (IDP)

Because correctional and detention facilities may not have enough space to provide an individual cell for each quarantined IDP, they may need to form cohorts of quarantined IDP who were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at the same time.

Some IDP in a quarantined cohort may be infected without showing symptoms or may not test positive due to early stage infection. Infected persons may transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others several days before the onset of symptoms, or even if they never develop symptoms. To prevent continued transmission of the virus within a quarantined cohort, re-testing those who originally tested negative every 3 to 7 days could be considered, until no new cases are identified for 14 days after the most recent positive result. The specific re-testing interval that a facility chooses could be based on: The stage of the ongoing outbreak (i.e., more frequent testing in the context of escalating outbreaks, less frequent testing when transmission has slowed) The availability of testing supplies and capacity of staff to perform repeat testing without negatively impacting other essential health care services Financial resources to fund repeat testing, including procurement of testing supplies, laboratory testing services, and personal protective equipment (PPE) The capacity of on-site, contract laboratories, or public health laboratories that will be performing the tests The expected wait time for test results (and resulting capacity for timely action based on the results)

If IDP who are close contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case test positive for SARS-CoV-2, they should be placed under medical isolation. If an IDP who tested positive was part of a quarantine cohort, restart the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder of the cohort.

See detailed guidance on recommendations for how to organize quarantine and medical isolation in correctional and detention settings in Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities.

Limitations of a re-testing strategy include:

Facilities may not have staff and testing capacity to organize testing of large numbers of IDP on a serial basis.

Long wait times for receiving large numbers of test results may make frequent re-testing impractical to implement.

Frequent re-testing within a quarantine cohort may result in a prolonged quarantine period for the entire cohort if one individual tests positive part-way through quarantine and the 14-day clock must be restarted. It may become challenging to find space to quarantine individuals in correctional or detention facilities for extended periods of time.

Frequent re-testing may become burdensome for IDP and increase the proportion of individuals who decline testing.

Practical considerations for implementing re-testing of quarantined individuals should include the availability of space, resources, potential limitations of this strategy and the ability to act on results. The decision about frequency of re-testing in correctional and detention facilities should be made in collaboration with state/local health departments.

Testing asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification

Correctional and detention facilities may consider testing asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 exposure in communities with moderate to substantial levels of community transmission. Practical considerations for implementing this strategy include the availability of resources, timeliness of results, and the ability for a coordinated response between the health department or other testing agency/provider and the correctional or detention facility. Decisions about testing strategies in correctional and detention facilities should be made in collaboration with state/local health departments. The testing strategies below aim to reduce the risk of introducing SARS-CoV-2 into the correctional or detention facility (i.e., testing newly incarcerated or detained persons) and to reduce the risk of widespread transmission through early identification of infection among existing IDP and staff. Facilities in communities with moderate to substantial levels of community transmission can consider the following:

Baseline testing for all current IDP.

Testing all new IDP at intake before they join the rest of the population in the facility, and housing them individually while test results are pending to prevent potential transmission. Some facilities may choose to implement a “routine intake quarantine” in which new IDP are housed individually for 14 days before being integrated into general housing.

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 and reviewing results before transferring IDP to another facility or releasing them to the community, particularly if an IDP will transition to a congregate setting with persons at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Refer to Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities for more information about transfer and release recommendations. Consider combining pre-transfer/release testing with a 14-day quarantine (ideally in single cells) before an individual’s projected transfer or release date to further reduce risk of transmission to other facilities or the community.

Transmission-based precautions for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases

Staff

All staff with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear cloth face coverings (if not already wearing one, and unless contraindicated), self-isolate at home, connect with appropriate medical care as soon as possible, and follow medical care and instructions.

Incarcerated or detained persons (IDP)

All IDP with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be provided with cloth face coverings (if not already wearing one, and unless contraindicated), connected to appropriate medical care as soon as possible, and placed in medical isolation until medical care and instructions can be provided.

Criteria for discontinuing medical isolation of IDP with COVID-19

For persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness who are not severely immunocompromised, medical isolation can be discontinued when: At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared (or since first positive viral test, if asymptomatic), At least 24 hours have passed since last fever , without the use of fever-reducing medications, and Symptoms have improved.

medical isolation can be discontinued when: For persons with severe illness or who are severely immunocompromised , medical isolation can be discontinued when: At least 20 days have passed since symptoms first appeared (or since first positive viral test, if asymptomatic), At least 24 hours have passed since last fever , without the use of fever-reducing medications, and Symptoms have improved. Consider consultation with infection control experts.

Guidance and Tips for Tribal Community Living During COVID-19,"Everyone has a role to play to reduce and slow the transmission of COVID-19. Social distancing is an essential step in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing is reducing physical interaction between people and it lowers the chances of spreading illness between people. Practice social distancing by putting space (at least 6 feet) between yourself and others. It is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

These people include older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions. People can follow social distancing by reducing how often they are physically near others, reducing the overall number of people they are physically near, and by keeping at least 6 feet away from others when they do leave their homes. Staying physically apart is important, even in places like the workplace, school, when shopping, or in other places in your community. The goal of social distancing is to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.",4/30/20 0:00,
Manufacturing Workers and Employers,"Cloth face coverings in manufacturing work CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings as a protective measure in addition to social distancing (i.e., staying at least 6 feet away from others). Cloth face coverings may be especially important when social distancing is not possible or feasible based on working conditions. A cloth face covering may reduce the amount of large respiratory droplets that a person spreads when talking, sneezing, or coughing. Cloth face coverings may prevent people who do not know they have the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading it to others. Cloth face coverings are intended to protect other people—not the wearer. Cloth face coverings are not PPE. They are not appropriate substitutes for PPE such as respirators (like N95 respirators) or medical facemasks (like surgical masks) in workplaces where respirators or facemasks are recommended or required to protect the wearer. While wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in communities, wearing a single cloth face covering for the full duration of a work shift (e.g., eight or more hours) in a manufacturing facility may not be practical if the face covering becomes wet, soiled, or otherwise visibly contaminated during the work shift. If cloth face coverings are worn in these facilities, employers should provide readily available clean cloth face coverings (or disposable facemask options) for workers to use when the coverings become wet, soiled, or otherwise visibly contaminated. Employers who determine that cloth face coverings should be worn in the workplace, including to comply with state or local requirements for their use, should ensure the cloth face coverings: fit over the nose and mouth and fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face;

are secured with ties or ear loops;

include multiple layers of fabric;

allow for breathing without restriction;

can be laundered using the warmest appropriate water setting and machine dried daily after the shift, without damage or change to shape (a clean cloth face covering should be used each day);

are not used if they become wet or contaminated;

are replaced with clean replacements, provided by the employer, as needed.

are handled as little as possible to prevent transferring infectious materials to or from the cloth; and

are not worn with or instead of respiratory protection when respirators are needed.

Educate and train workers and supervisors about how they can reduce the spread of COVID-19

Supplement workers’ normal and required job training (e.g., training required under OSHA standards) with additional training and information about COVID-19, including recognizing signs and symptoms of infection and ways to prevent exposure to the virus. Training should include information about how to implement the various infection prevention and control measures recommended here and included in any infection prevention and control or COVID-19 response plan that an employer develops. OSHA provides additional informationexternal icon about training on its COVID-19 webpage.

All communication and training should be easy to understand and should (1) be provided in languages appropriate to the preferred languages spoken or read by the workers, if possible; (2) be at the appropriate literacy level; and (3) include accurate and timely information about:

Signs and symptoms of COVID-19, risks for workplace exposures, the spread of the virus, and how workers can protect themselves;

Proper handwashing practices and use of hand sanitizer stations;

Cough and sneeze etiquette; and

Other routine infection control precautions (e.g., signs and symptoms of COVID-19, putting on or taking off masks or cloth face coverings and social distancing measures).

Employers should place simple posters in all of the languages that are common in the worker population that encourage staying home when sick (or after testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19), cough and sneeze etiquette, and proper hand hygiene practices. They should place these posters at the entrance to the workplace and in break areas, locker rooms, and other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.

CDC has free, simple posters available to download and print, some of which are translated into different languages.

Employers should post signs that you can read from a far distance (or use portable, electronic reader boards) that inform visitors and workers of social distancing practices.

Employers should provide alternative training for workers who cannot read written materials or who require other reasonable accommodations.

OSHA understands that some employers may face difficulties complying with OSHA standards due to the ongoing health emergency, including those standards that require certain types of worker training. OSHA is providing enforcement discretionexternal icon around the completion of training and other provisions in its various standards. OSHA has instructed its Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs) to evaluate whether an employer has made a good faith effort to comply with applicable OSHA standards and, in situations where compliance was not possible given the ongoing pandemic, to ensure that employees were not exposed to hazards from tasks, processes, or equipment for which they were not prepared or trained.

Cleaning and disinfection in manufacturing

For tool-intensive operations, employers should ensure tools are regularly cleaned and disinfected, including at least as often as workers change workstations or move to a new set of tools. Refer to List Nexternal icon on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2.

Establish protocols and provide supplies to increase the frequency of sanitization in work and common spaces. Disinfect frequently touched surfaces in workspaces and break rooms (e.g., microwave and refrigerator handles, vending machine touchpads, knobs, levels, and sink handles) at least once per shift, if possible. For example, wipe down tools or other equipment at least as often as workers change workstations. Frequently clean push bars and handles on any doors that do not open automatically and handrails on stairs or along walkways. If physical barriers are being used, then these should be cleaned frequently.

Workers who perform cleaning and disinfection tasks may require additional PPE and other controls to protect them from chemical hazards posed by disinfectants. Note: Employers must ensure their written hazard communication programexternal icon is up to date and training is up to date for all employees. (Also, see OSHA’s enforcement discretion memorandumexternal icon on this topic.) Employers may need to adapt guidance from this section, the Environmental Services Workers and Employersexternal icon section, and the Interim Guidance for Workers and Employers of Workers at Increased Risk of Occupational Exposureexternal icon, to fully protect workers performing cleaning and disinfection activities in manufacturing workplaces.

Screening[1] and monitoring workers

Workplaces, particularly in areas where community transmission of COVID-19 is occurring, should consider developing and implementing a comprehensive screening and monitoring strategy aimed at preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into the work site. Consider a program of screening workers before entry into the workplace, criteria for exclusion of sick workers, including asymptomatic workers who have tested positive for COVID-19; and criteria for return to work of exposed and recovered (those who have had signs or symptoms of COVID-19 but have gotten better).. This type of program should be coordinated to the extent possible with local public health authorities and could consist of the following activities:

Screening of workers for COVID-19

Screening manufacturing workers for COVID-19 symptoms (such as temperature checks) is an optional strategy that employers can use. If implemented for all workers, policies and procedures for screening workers should be developed in consultation with state and local health officials and occupational medicine professionals. Options to screen workers for COVID-19 symptoms include:

Screen before entry into the facility.

Provide verbal screening in appropriate language(s) to determine whether workers have had symptoms including a cough or shortness of breath, or at least two of these: fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell. in the past 24 hours.

Check temperatures of workers at the start of each shift to identify anyone with a fever of 100.4°F or greater (or reported feelings of feverishness). Ensure that screeners: Are trained to use temperature monitors and monitors are accurate under conditions of use (such as cold temperatures); and Wear appropriate PPE.

Do not let employees enter the workplace if they have a fever of 100.4°F or greater (or reported feelings of feverishness), or if screening results indicate that the worker is suspected of having COVID-19. Encourage workers to self-isolate and contact a healthcare provider; Provide information on the facility’s return-to-work policies and procedures; and Inform human resources, employer health unit (if in place), and supervisor (so the worker can be moved off schedule during illness and a replacement can be assigned, if needed).



Ensure that personnel performing screening activities, including temperature checks, are appropriately protected from exposure to potentially infectious workers entering the facility:

Implement engineering controls, such as physical barriers or dividers or rope and stanchion systems, to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between screeners and workers being screened.

If screeners need to be within 6 feet of workers, provide them with appropriate PPE based on the repeated close contact the screeners have with other workers. Such PPE may include gloves, a gown, a face shield, and, at a minimum, a face mask. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (or more protective) may be appropriate for workers performing screening duties and necessary for workers managing a sick employee in the work environment (see below) if that employee has signs or symptoms of COVID-19. If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard external icon (29 CFR 1910.134).



Managing sick workers

Workers who appear to have symptoms including a cough or shortness of breath, or at least two of these: fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell upon arrival at work or who become sick during the day should immediately be separated from others at the workplace and sent home.

Ensure that personnel managing sick employees are appropriately protected from exposure. When personnel need to be within 6 feet of a sick colleague, appropriate PPE may include gloves, a gown, a face shield and, at a minimum, a face mask. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (or more protective) may be appropriate for workers managing a sick employee if that employee has signs or symptoms of COVID-19. If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standardexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.134).

If a worker is confirmed to have COVID-19 (regardless of whether that has had symptoms of COVID-19), employers should inform anyone they have come into contact with (including fellow workers, inspectors, graders, etc.) of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but should maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The employer should instruct fellow workers about how to proceed based on the CDC Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure.

If a worker becomes or reports being sick, or testing positive for COVID-19, disinfect the workstation used and any tools handled by the worker.

Employers should work with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health officials to facilitate the identification of other exposed and potentially exposed individuals, such as coworkers in a plant.

On-site healthcare personnel, such as facility nurses or emergency medical technicians, should follow appropriate CDC and OSHAexternal icon guidance for healthcare and emergency response personnel.

Addressing return to work

Critical infrastructure employers have an obligation to manage the continuation of work and return to work of their workers in ways that best protect the health of workers, their coworkers, and the general public. Employers should consider providing screening and ongoing medical monitoring of these workers, ensuring they wear an appropriate source control device (e.g cloth face covering and/or face shield) in accordance with CDC and OSHA guidance and any state or local requirements, and implementing social distancing to minimize the chances of workers exposing one another.

Critical infrastructure employers should continue to minimize the number of workers present at work sites, balancing the need to protect workers with support for continuing critical operations.

Reintegration (bringing back) of exposed, asymptomatic workers to on-site operations should follow the CDC Critical Infrastructure Guidance. The guidance advises that employers may permit workers who have been exposed to COVID-19, but remain without symptoms, to continue to work, provided they adhere to additional safety precautions. Consultation with an occupational health provider and state and local health officials will help employers develop the most appropriate plan.

Reintegration of workers with COVID-19 (COVID-19 positive), including those workers who have remained asymptomatic, to on-site operations should follow the CDC interim guidance, “Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings.” As noted above, consultation with an occupational health provider and state and local health officials will help employers develop the most appropriate plan.

As employers move forward with continuing essential work, they should implement strategies to prioritize positions without which critical work would stop. This prioritization should include an analysis of work tasks, workforce availability at specific work sites, and assessment of hazards associated with the tasks and work site. Employers may be able to cross-train workers to perform critical duties at a work site to minimize the total number of workers needed to continue operations.

For workers who have had signs/symptoms of COVID-19

Both workers with COVID-19 who have symptoms and those that have tested positive for COVID-19and have stayed home (home isolated) should not return to work until they have met the criteria to discontinue home isolation, and have consulted with their healthcare providers and state and local health departments.

The situation is constantly changing, so employers of critical infrastructure workers will need to continue to reassess the virus’s transmission levels in their area and follow recommendations from local, state, and federal officials. This guidance does not replace state and local directives for businesses.

Personal protective equipment

Employers must conduct a hazard assessment to determine if hazards for which workers need PPE are present, or are likely to be present. OSHA’s PPE standardsexternal icon (29 CFR 1910 Subpart I) require employers to select and provide appropriate PPE to protect workers from hazards identified in the hazard assessment. The results of that assessment will be the basis of workplace controls (including PPE) needed to protect workers.

Employers should:

Use videos or in-person visual demonstrations of proper PPE donning (putting on) and doffing(removal) procedures. (Maintain social distancing during these demonstrations.)

Emphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off PPE to ensure that the worker or the item does not become contaminated.

Provide PPE that is either disposable (preferred) or, if reusable, ensure it is properly disinfected and stored in a clean location when not in use.

PPE worn at the facility should not be taken home or shared.

Face shields may serve as both PPE and source control:

If helmets are being used, use face shields designed to attach to helmets.

Face shields can provide additional protection from both potential process-related splashes and potential person-to-person droplet spread. Safety glasses may fog up when used in combination with masks or cloth face coverings. Only some face shields are acceptable substitutions for eye protection (such as safety glasses) that are used for impact protection; facilities should consult with an occupational safety and health professional concerning the use of face shields.

Face shields can help minimize contamination of masks and cloth face coverings.

If used, face shields should be cleaned and decontaminated after each shift, and when not in use they should be kept in a clean location at the work facility.

If used, face shields should also wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin.

Employers should stress hand hygiene before and after handling all PPE. Employers in manufacturing industries should continue to stay up to date on the most current guidance concerning PPE.

As part of their hazard assessments, employers must always consider whether PPE is necessary to protect workers. Specifically, when engineering and administrative controls are difficult to maintain and there may be exposure to other workplace hazards, such disinfectants used for facility cleaning, PPE should be considered.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturing employers should consider allowing voluntary use of filtering facepiece respirators (such as an N95, if available) for their workers, even if respirators are not normally required. Employers who permit voluntary use of respirators must comply with applicable provisions of OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standardexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.134), including proving a copy of Appendix D – Information for Employees Using Respirators When Not Required Under Standardexternal icon to employees who use such equipment.

In addition to face shields as noted above, workers in manufacturing facilities may need PPE such as gloves, face and eye protection, and other types of PPE when cleaning and disinfecting manufacturing plants (including frequently touched surfaces), tools, and equipment.

When PPE is needed, employers should consider additional hazards created by poorly fitting PPE (e.g., mask ties that dangle or catch, PPE that is loose and requires frequent adjustment or tends to fall off), including hazards resulting from use of such PPE in a particular work environment (e.g., where workers are around machinery in which PPE could get caught).

Workers’ rights

Section 11(c)external icon of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970external icon (29 USC 660(c)) prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for raising concerns about safety and health conditions. Additionally, OSHA’s Whistleblower Protection Programexternal icon enforces the provisions of more than 20 industry-specific federal laws protecting employees from retaliation for raising or reporting concerns about hazards or violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health insurance reform, motor vehicle safety, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime, securities, and tax laws. OSHA encourages workers who suffer such retaliation to submit a complaint to OSHAexternal icon as soon as possible in order to file their complaint within the legal time limits, some of which may be as short as 30 days from the date they learned of or experienced retaliation. An employee can file a complaint with OSHA by visiting or calling his or her local OSHA office; sending a written complaint via fax, mail, or email to the closest OSHA office; or filing a complaint onlineexternal icon. No particular form is required, and complaints may be submitted in any language.

OSHA provides recommendations intended to assist employers in creating workplaces that are free of retaliation and guidance to employers on how to properly respond to workers who may complain about workplace hazards or potential violations of federal laws. OSHA urges employers to review its publication Recommended Practices for Anti-Retaliation Programspdf iconexternal icon.

[1] Employers should evaluate the burdens and benefits of recording workers’ temperatures or asking them to complete written questionnaires. These types of written products become records that must be retained for the duration of the workers’ employment plus 30 years.

What Workers Need to Know about Heat Stress Prevention during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"More info about Heat Stress Employers

Your employer may tailor the existing heat illness prevention program and policies to the unique challenges of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Heat stress is the total amount of heat your body encounters. It may come from a variety of sources, such as:

Heat from work processes and machinery (e.g., forge)

Environmental temperatures, humidity, and lack of air movement (e.g., no wind or inadequate air circulation)

Internal metabolic processes (e.g., illnesses that create a fever)

Heat generated by your muscles from physical exertion

Clothing and personal protective equipment (PPE) may also trap heat, further increasing heat exposure.

Workers who are exposed to extreme heat, work in hot environments, or perform physically demanding work in moderate heat environments may be at risk for heat-related illnesses and injuries. The most severe form of heat-related illness is heat stroke, a life-threatening medical emergency that can result in death.

Early signs of heat stroke may include:

Confusion

Difficulty performing routine tasks or answering simple questions (e.g., “What is today’s date?” “Where are we?”)

Slurred speech

Late signs of heat stroke may include:

Seizures

Loss of consciousness

Organ failure resulting in death

In addition to training you on the signs and symptoms of heat-related illnesses, including heat stroke, your employer should provide instruction on general first aid and how to obtain prompt medical treatment for anyone who may experience a heat-related illness at work.

This CDC Guidance for Businesses and Employers highlights some of the changes you may see at your worksite to minimize the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Some of these may be part of your employer’s existing heat illness prevention program and may increase your risk for heat-related illnesses due to:",4/30/20 0:00,
Employer Information for Heat Stress Prevention during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"More info about Heat Stress Employees

Existing heat illness prevention programs and policies can be tailored to the unique challenges of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Heat from work processes and machinery (e.g., forge)

Environmental temperatures, humidity, and lack of air movement (e.g., no wind or inadequate air circulation)

Internal metabolic processes (e.g., illnesses that create fever)

Heat generated by muscles from physical exertion

Risk Factors for Heat-related Illnesses

Many risk factors can increase a worker’s risk for a heat-related illness. Risk factors may be related to the work environment or characteristics of the individual worker or their current health status.

Examples of heat-related illness risk factors include:

High temperature and humidity

Direct sun exposure

Indoor radiant heat sources (e.g., machinery)

Limited air movement

Not drinking enough fluids to maintain hydration

Physical exertion

PPE and clothing (i.e., these may trap heat close to the body)

Physical condition (e.g., obesity) and health problems

Certain medications

Pregnancy

Lack of acclimatization (i.e., not being used to the heat)

Advanced age

Having had a previous heat-related illness

Heat-related Illnesses

Heat stroke, the most severe form of heat-related illness is a life-threatening medical emergency. As part of your heat illness prevention program, ensure that all staff is trained to recognize early signs of heat-related illness and understand the need to get prompt medical treatment to prevent heat stroke deaths.

Cleaning and Disinfection for Households,"Summary of Recent Changes Revisions were made on 3/26/2020 to reflect the following: Updated links to EPA-registered disinfectant list

Added guidance for disinfection of electronics

Updated core disinfection/cleaning guidance

Background

There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is currently known about COVID-19, spread from person-to-person of this virus happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets. On the other hand, transmission of novel coronavirus to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through objects and surfaces, like doorknobs, countertops, keyboards, toys, etc. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings.

It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air.

Purpose

This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of households where persons under investigation (PUI) or those with confirmed COVID-19 reside or may be in self- isolation. It is aimed at limiting the survival of the virus in the environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.

These guidelines are focused on household settings and are meant for the general public.

Cleaning refers to the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection.

refers to the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting refers to using chemicals, for example, EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection.

General recommendations for routine cleaning and disinfection of households

Community members can practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks, and electronics (see below for special electronics cleaning and disinfection instructions)) with household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants external icon that are appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product. For electronics follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.

that are appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.

General recommendations for cleaning and disinfection of households with people isolated in home care (e.g. suspected/confirmed to have COVID-19)

Household members should educate themselves about COVID-19 symptoms and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in homes.

Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, keyboards, handles, desks, toilets, sinks) In the bedroom/bathroom dedicated for an ill person: consider reducing cleaning frequency to as-needed (e.g., soiled items and surfaces) to avoid unnecessary contact with the ill person.

As much as possible, an ill person should stay in a specific room and away from other people in their home, following home care guidance.

The caregiver can provide personal cleaning supplies for an ill person’s room and bathroom, unless the room is occupied by child or another person for whom such supplies would not be appropriate. These supplies include tissues, paper towels, cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants (see examples external icon ).

). If a separate bathroom is not available, the bathroom should be cleaned and disinfected after each use by an ill person. If this is not possible, the caregiver should wait as long as practical after use by an ill person to clean and disinfect the high-touch surfaces.

Household members should follow home care guidance when interacting with persons with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 and their isolation rooms/bathrooms.

How to clean and disinfect

Hard (Non-porous) Surfaces

Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.

If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

Always read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use. Wear skin protection and consider eye protection for potential splash hazards

Ensure adequate ventilation

Use no more than the amount recommended on the label

Use water at room temperature for dilution (unless stated otherwise on the label)

Avoid mixing chemical products

Label diluted cleaning solutions

Store and use chemicals out of the reach of children and pets You should never eat, drink, breathe or inject these products into your body or apply directly to your skin as they can cause serious harm. Do not wipe or bathe pets with these products or any other products that are not approved for animal use. See EPA’s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Useexternal icon Special considerations should be made for people with asthma and they should not be present when cleaning and disinfecting is happening as this can trigger asthma exacerbations. To learn more about reducing asthma triggers: https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/reduce_triggers.html

A list of disinfectant products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here external icon . Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Read the product label for the correct concentration to use, application method, and contact time.

Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted: Use bleach containing 5.25%–8.25% sodium hypochlorite. Do not use a bleach product if the percentage is not in this range or is not specified. Follow the manufacturer’s application instructions for the surface, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute. Ensure proper ventilation during and after application. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. This can cause fumes that may be very dangerous to breathe in.

Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: 5 tablespoons (1/3 rd cup) of 5.25–8.25% bleach per gallon of room temperature water or 4 teaspoons of 5.25–8.25% bleach per quart of room temperature water



Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.

Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.

Soft (Porous) Surfaces

For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 external icon and that are suitable for porous surfaces.



Electronics

For electronics such as cell phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, and keyboards, remove visible contamination if present. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.



Linens, clothing, and other items that go in the laundry

Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and then discard after each use. If using reusable gloves, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other household purposes. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed. If no gloves are used when handling dirty laundry, be sure to wash hands afterwards. If possible, do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air. Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s items. Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If possible, consider placing a bag liner that is either disposable (can be thrown away) or can be laundered.



Hand hygiene and other preventive measures

Household members should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.

Always read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use. Keep hand sanitizers away from fire or flame

For children under six years of age, hand sanitizer should be used with adult supervision

Always store hand sanitizer out of reach of children and pets See FDA’s Tips for Safe Sanitizer Useexternal icon and CDC’s Hand Sanitizer Use Considerations

Household members should follow normal preventive actions while at work and home including recommended hand hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Additional key times to clean hands include: After blowing one’s nose, coughing, or sneezing After using the restroom Before eating or preparing food After contact with animals or pets Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance (e.g. a child)



Other considerations",##########,
Households Living in Close Quarters,"This guidance is intended for people living together in close quarters, such as people who share a small apartment, or for people who live in the same household with large or extended families.

People of any age who have certain underlying medical conditions are at risk for getting COVID-19. Some groups have an increased risk for severe illness from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The following information is aimed to help you protect those who are most vulnerable in your household.

Everyone should limit risks",##########,
Treatments Your Healthcare Provider Might Recommend for Severe Illness,"The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to or spreading the virus that causes COVID-19:

Wash your hands often.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick and people who don’t live in your household.

Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others.

Cover your coughs and sneezes.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

Monitor your health daily.

Getting a flu vaccine is more important than ever this flu season to protect yourself, your family and your community from flu. A flu vaccine can also help reduce the burden on our healthcare systems responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and save medical resources for care of COVID-19 patients.

If you think you may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider.

Stay home and away from the people you live with as much as possible.

Consider getting tested.

Monitor your symptoms.

If you show an emergency warning sign , seek emergency medical care immediately. Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Emergency warning signs include:

Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face.



The FDA can issue emergency use authorizationexternal icon s (EUAs) to allow healthcare providers to use products that are not yet approved, or that are approved for other uses, to treat patients with COVID-19 if certain legal requirements are met.

Any treatments that are used for COVID-19 should be taken under the care of a healthcare provider.

People have been seriously harmed and even died after taking unapproved products to self-treat.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed and regularly updates Treatment Guidelinesexternal icon to help guide healthcare providers caring for patients with COVID-19, including when clinicians might consider using one of the products under an EUA. Currently, there are several approaches for treating patients with severe COVID-19 who are being cared for in the hospital. In studies, some drugs have shown some benefit in reducing the severity of illness or risk of death by:

Slowing the virus. Antiviral medications reduce the ability of the virus to multiply and spread through the body. Remdesivir external icon is an antiviral medication that is recommended in the current NIH Treatment Guidelines external icon for patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 and, if supplies are limited, require supplemental oxygen. Remdesivir is given to patients by infusion through their veins.



Reducing an overactive immune response. In patients with severe COVID-19, the body’s immune system may overreact to the threat of the virus. This can cause damage to the body’s organs and tissues. Some treatments can help reduce an overactive immune response that worsens the disease. Dexamethasone external icon is a steroid medication, similar to a natural hormone produced by the body. The NIH Treatment Guidelines external icon recommend dexamethasone, or a similar medication, for some hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 to prevent or reduce injury to the body. Dexamethasone is recommended for patients who need supplemental oxygen.

Treating complications. The virus that causes COVID-19 can damage the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal organs. It also can cause other complications. Depending on the complications, additional treatments might be used for severely ill hospitalized patients, such as blood thinners to prevent or treat blood clots.

Supporting the body’s immune function. Antibodies from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 (convalescent plasma) or antibodies manufactured for COVID-19 (like monoclonal antibodies) can attach to parts of the virus. This could help the immune system recognize and respond more effectively to the virus, but currently the NIH Treatment Guidelines external icon find there is not enough evidence to recommend these treatments.

find there is not enough evidence to recommend these treatments. Relieving symptoms and supporting the body’s natural defenses. Taking medications, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can reduce fever. Drinking or receiving intravenous fluids can help patients stay hydrated. Getting plenty of rest can help the body fight the virus.



Other products are being studied as potential treatments for COVID-19. Information about these ongoing studies can be found at ClinicalTrials.govexternal icon.",##########,
Long-Term Effects of COVID-19,"CDC is actively working to learn more about the whole range of short- and long-term health effects associated with COVID-19. As the pandemic unfolds, we are learning that many organs besides the lungs are affected by COVID-19 and there are many ways the infection can affect someone’s health.

One of the health effects that CDC is closely watching and working to understand relates to COVID-19 and the heart. Heart conditions associated with COVID-19 include inflammation and damage to the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, or inflammation of the covering of the heart, known as pericarditis. These conditions can occur by themselves or in combination. Heart damage may be an important part of severe disease and death from COVID-19, especially in older people with underlying illness. Heart damage like this might also explain some frequently reported long-term symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart palpitations.

The risk of heart damage may not be limited to older and middle-aged adults. For example, young adults with COVID-19, including athletes, can also suffer from myocarditis. Severe heart damage has occurred in young, healthy people, but is rare. There may be more cases of mild effects of COVID-19 on the heart that can be diagnosed with special imaging tests, including in younger people with mild or minimal symptoms; however, the long-term significance of these mild effects on the heart are unknown. CDC will continue to assess and provide updates as new data emerge.

The best strategies for preventing COVID-19 infection in youth and adults are to wear a mask in public places, stay at least 6 feet away from other people, frequently wash your hands, and avoid crowds and confined or poorly ventilated spaces.",##########,
Certain Medical Conditions and Risk for Severe COVID-19 Illness,"Summary of Recent Changes Revisions were made on October 6, 2020 to reflect recent data supporting increased risk of severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19 among adults with COVID-19 who have obesity, who have overweight, or who smoke or have a history of smoking. These revisions also make the document more explicit about data and implications for adults and for children. The listed underlying medical conditions in children were also revised to indicate that these conditions might increase risk to better reflect the quality of available data currently. This reflects the fact that there are less data available for children and does not imply that children are not at risk. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day, and as new information becomes available, CDC will update the information below. ​

Adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19:

Adults of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19:

COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, adults of any age with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19:

Want to see the evidence behind these lists?

While children have been less affected by COVID-19 compared to adults, children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and some children develop severe illness. Children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness compared to children without underlying medical conditions. Current evidence on which underlying medical conditions in children are associated with increased risk is limited. Children with the following conditions might be at increased risk for severe illness: obesity, medical complexity, severe genetic disorders, severe neurologic disorders, inherited metabolic disorders, congenital (since birth) heart disease, diabetes, asthma and other chronic lung disease, and immunosuppression due to malignancy or immune-weakening medications. We do not yet know who is at increased risk for developing the rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19 in children called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), nor do we know what causes MIS-C. Learn about MIS-C.

The list of underlying conditions is meant to inform clinicians to help them provide the best care possible for patients, and to inform individuals as to what their level of risk may be so they can make individual decisions about illness prevention. We are learning more about COVID-19 every day. This list is not exhaustive and only includes conditions with sufficient evidence to draw conclusions; it is a living document that may be updated at any time, subject to potentially rapid change as the science evolves.

Reduce your risk of getting COVID-19

It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:

Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.

Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others.

If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your healthcare provider within 24 hours.

Venturing out into a public setting? What to consider before you go.

As communities and businesses across the United States are opening, you may be thinking about resuming some activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible.

People at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.

Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a mask, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing masks or ask others around you to wear masks.

Are you considering in-person visits with family and friends? Here are some things to consider to help make your visit as safe as possible:

When to delay or cancel a visit

Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.

In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. So, think about:

How many people will you interact with?

Can you keep 6 feet of space between you and others?

Will you be outdoors or indoors?

What’s the length of time that you will be interacting with people?

Encourage social distancing during your visit

Visit with your friends and family outdoors , when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing.

, when possible. If this is not feasible, make sure the room or space is well-ventilated (for example, open windows or doors) and large enough to accommodate social distancing. Arrange tables and chairs to allow for social distancing. People from the same household can be in groups together and don’t need to be 6 feet apart from each other.

Consider activities where social distancing can be maintained, like sidewalk chalk art or yard games.

Try to avoid close contact with your visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump, or hug. Instead wave and verbally greet them.

If possible, avoid others who are not wearing masks or ask others around you to wear masks.

Consider keeping a list of people you visited or who visited you and when the visit occurred. This will help with contact tracing if someone becomes sick.

Wear masks

Masks should be worn over the nose and mouth. Masks are especially important when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet apart from others or when people are indoors to help protect each other.

Masks may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others Wearing a mask helps protects others in case you’re infected, while others wear one to protect you should they be infected.

Who should NOT use masks: Children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Wash hands often

Everyone should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at the beginning and end of the visit and whenever you think your hands may have become contaminated.

If soap and water are not readily available, such as with outdoor visits or activities, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Remind guests to wash or sanitize their hands before serving or eating food.

Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so visitors do not share towels. Have a no-touch trash can available for guests to use.

Limit contact with commonly touched surfaces or shared items

Encourage your visitors to bring their own food and drinks.

Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use.

If you choose to use any shared items that are reusable (e.g., seating covers, tablecloths, linen napkins), wash, clean, and sanitize them after the event.

If you are thinking about participating in an event or gathering:

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, consider avoiding high-risk gatherings. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.

More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear masks, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.

Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic

Staying healthy during the pandemic is important. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventive services are up to date to help prevent you from becoming ill with other diseases.

It is particularly important for those at increased risk of severe illness, including older adults, to receive recommended vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease.

Talk with your healthcare provider about maintaining preventive services like cancer screenings during the pandemic.

Remember the importance of staying physically active and practicing healthy habits to cope with stress.

If you have a medical emergency, do not delay seeking emergency care.

If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan:

Continue your medicines and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.

and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Have at least a 30-day supply of prescription and non-prescription medicines.

Others At Risk for COVID-19,"box tissue light icon

Getting a flu vaccine during 2020-2021 is more important than ever because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk from flu; many of whom are also at high risk for COVID-19 or serious outcomes.",##########,
Rural Communities,"About 46 million Americans live in rural areas, which face distinctive challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put some rural residents at increased risk of getting COVID-19 or having severe illness. In general, rural Americans tend to have higher rates of cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, and obesity as well as less access to healthcare which can negatively affect health outcomes. They are also less likely to have health insurance.

Rural communities are also becoming more diverse racially and ethnically. Racial and ethnic minority groups including, African Americans, Hispanics and Latinos, American Indians/Alaskan Natives, and Asian/Pacific Islanders, are at increased risk of getting COVID-19 and having severe illness.

Rural areas can face different health challenges depending on where they are located. Each rural community should assess their unique susceptibilitypdf iconexternal icon and social vulnerability to COVID-19. Many rural communities are considered highly vulnerable according to CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The SVI includes factors such as housing, transportation, socioeconomic status, housing, race and ethnicity, and language which can be helpful in determining how to help support rural communities before, during, and after COVID-19.

Rural communities also have strengths, assets, and protective factors that public health can use to tailor policies and messages designed to:

reduce the risk of COVID-19 community spread and improve the general health of rural populations, which may minimize the severity of COVID-19.

How Rural Communities Can Respond During COVID-19

Approaches for public health professionals

Approaches for rural healthcare systems and healthcare providers

Planning

Patient Care

Approaches for community-based organizations and interest groups

Review COVID-19 information, considerations for community-based organizations, and communication resources from federal, state, and local governments.

Inform your community that COVID-19 cases can occur, even with careful planning and preparation. Some people can spread the disease before they start having symptoms, or even if they never have symptoms.

Educate the community about COVID-19 prevention behaviors and use of masks.

Provide information on hygiene practices and limiting travel.

Plan and communicate about consistent mitigation activities, given there is no treatment, vaccine, or other pharmaceutical intervention for COVID-19.

Engage community members in education campaigns and mitigation efforts. Residents, local business, and media may have creative ideas on ways to protect their community. Find innovative ideas on the Rural Health Information Hub (RHIhub external icon ).

Be aware of possible stigma related to testing and having COVID-19.

Work with local healthcare providers and organizations to develop a Community Health Work (CHW) program external icon if the community does not already have one.

if the community does not already have one. Make every attempt to continue services for rural homeless populations in the event of community spread of COVID-19. See CDC’s resources for supporting people experiencing homelessness

See CDC communication resources.

Approaches for rural residents

The best way to prevent becoming sick is to avoid being exposed to the virus. This means staying home whenever possible and avoiding public places where you may encounter many other people. If you are near other people, try to keep 6 feet apart (about two arm lengths).

Use masks and other COVID-19 prevention behaviors to limit exposure to the virus.

Know how to contact a healthcare provider if you or a family member becomes ill.

Keep preventive care and other routine healthcare appointments, such as vaccinations and blood pressure checks, when possible. Check with your provider about safety precautions for office visits.

Volunteer by contacting community service organizations and ask how you can help. Make and distribute masks for others in the community. Help older adults, people with disabilities, and others at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness, in your family or in the community, by shopping for groceries or running errands.

Create an information card with the phone numbers and addresses of healthcare facilities, along with the family and friends who live nearest to you. Locate state, local, or tribal health centers in advance to learn where to get tested for COVID-19, along with other COVID-19 health information.

Create a phone tree system with family, friends, and neighbors that will be helpful to share information and get messages out quickly if COVID-19 affects your community.

Know medicines your family members may need and see if you can have extra on hand to reduce visits to the pharmacist while COVID-19 is circulating in the community. Many health insurance plans now allow for early access to prescriptions, for more than a 90-day supply of medication.

Find ways that you and your family can cope with stress.

Approaches for businesses and workplaces

Consult with your local health department to get updated information about COVID-19 cases in the area.

Review CDC’s resources for businesses.

Talk to employees about their concerns, and share resources to keep employees and their families safe and help them cope with stress.

Use strategies that help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, and help protect all employees, including those at higher risk. These strategies include: Consider telework arrangements, if possible, along with other social distancing practices (staying at least 6 feet away from other people. This might mean making changes to the physical environment such as adding physical barriers (dividers). Encourage employees to stay home when sick using paid or non-punitive sick leave. Promote handwashing. Provide supplies for cleaning and disinfecting workspaces and appropriate personal protective equipment.



Additional considerations

People in rural areas are often in close proximity to animals, whether livestock, pets, or wildlife. Interactions between people and animals may occur during farming, working with animals, interacting with pets, visiting fairs or animal exhibitions, or coming into contact with wildlife while hunting, hiking, or during other outdoor activities, as well as when wildlife wander near homes. We are still learning about the virus that causes COVID-19, but it appears that it can spread from people to certain types of animals, including pets, in some situations. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.

Why Rural Communities May Be at Higher Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic

The health of populations in rural America

Rural Americans may be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 because they:

Are older external icon than non-rural populations.

than non-rural populations. Have higher rates of underlying chronic disease even after adjusting for age.

Are more likely to have a disability: Up to one-third of adults living in rural areas report having a disability, which is 9% higher than those living in more urban areas. Up to 1 in 12 adults living in rural counties report having three or more disabilities, which is 24% higher than those living in more urban areas. In the United States, adults with disabilities are 3 times as likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer as those without disabilities.



Healthcare infrastructure

Rural healthcare infrastructure is limited. Since 2005, 170 hospitals have closedexternal icon and 700 more are currently at risk of closure. Many rural hospitals have a limited number of hospital beds, ICU beds, or ventilators, which can affect their ability to treat patients with COVID-19. Rural residents seeking care must often travel long distances to reach hospitals, health care facilities, and clinical specialists.

Additional infrastructure issues affecting a rural community’s ability to respond to COVID-19 include:

Emergency medical services (EMS) often use volunteers who must travel long distances to respond to a call.

Shortage of health professionals for primary care is common in many rural areas.

Public health departments serving rural areas often serve large geographic regions, which include non-rural populations, further straining limited resources.

Widespread use of telemedicine is not possible in some areas because of absent or unreliable broadband and internet communications.

Agricultural and food processing industries

Meat, poultry, and food processing industries are largely located in rural areas. Occupations in these industries often involve working closer than the recommended 6-foot distance, which puts workers at increased risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. Not only are workers at risk because of the conditions in these industries, but the industries are considered critical and less likely to close, leaving workers little choice but to come to work even when other businesses are shut because of high community transmission. COVID-19 outbreaks among meat and poultry processing facility workers can rapidly affect large numbers of workers and extend into the communities where they live. Targeted workplace interventions and prevention efforts that are tailored to the groups most affected by COVID-19 are critical to reducing the risk of getting COVID-19 at work.

People with Disabilities,"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.

Disability alone may not be related to higher risk for getting COVID-19 or having severe illness. Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19. However, some people with disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection or severe illness because of their underlying medical conditions. All people seem to be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 if they have serious underlying chronic medical conditions like chronic lung disease, a serious heart condition, or a weakened immune system. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely than adults without disabilities to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities.

You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

Disability groups and risk

If you have one of the disability types listed below, you might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness. You should discuss your risk of illness with your healthcare provider.

People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members

People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing

People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness

Protect yourself

If you or someone you care for are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, take steps to prevent getting sick. In addition to practicing everyday preventive actions, people with disabilities who have direct support providers can help protect themselves from respiratory illness in the following ways:

Ask your direct support provider if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 or if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19

Tell your direct service provider to Wash their hands when they enter your home and before and after touching you (e.g., dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, toileting, feeding), handling tissues, or when changing linens or doing laundry. Learn more about proper handwashing. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (e.g., counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, bedside tables), and equipment such as wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, canes, oxygen tanks and tubing, communication boards and other assistive devices. Refer to CDC’s General Recommendations for Routine Cleaning and Disinfections of Households.



Prepare

There are some additional things people with disabilities can do to prepare during the COVID-19 outbreak:

Plan what you will do if you or your direct support provider gets sick. Create a contact list of family, friends, neighbors and local service agencies that can provide support in case you or your direct support provider becomes ill or unavailable.

Plan at least two ways of communicating from home and work that can be used rapidly in an emergency (e.g., landline phone, cell phone, text-messaging, email). Write down this information and keep it with you.

Have enough household items and groceries so that you will be comfortable staying home for a few weeks, at least a 30-day supply of over the counter and prescription medicines and any medical equipment or supplies that you might need. Some health plans allow for a 90-day refill on prescription medications. Consider discussing this option with your healthcare provider. Make a photocopy of prescriptions, as this may help in obtaining medications in an emergency situation.

About COVID-19

Coronavirus disease is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is also possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. For more information go to CDC’s Fact Sheet- What you need to know about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pdf icon .

. Risk of infection with COVID-19 is higher for people who are in close contact with someone known to have COVID-19, such as healthcare workers, direct support providers, and household members. Other people at higher risk for infection are those who live or have recently been in an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19.

Prevention and treatment

There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to take everyday preventive actions, like avoiding close contact with people who are sick and washing your hands often.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 can seek medical care to help relieve symptoms.",##########,
People with Developmental and Behavioral Disorders,"Developmental and behavioral disorders are a group of conditions due to an impairment in physical, learning, language, or behavior areas. These conditions begin during the developmental period, may affect day-to-day functioning, and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime.1

Some developmental and behavioral disorders include:

What do people with developmental and behavioral disorders need to know about COVID-19?

Know who is at risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Most people with developmental or behavioral disorders are not naturally at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from novel coronavirus (COVID-19). However, people with developmental or behavioral disorders who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at risk of serious illness. Some people with developmental or behavioral disorders may have difficulties accessing information, understanding or practicing preventative measures, and communicating symptoms of illness.

Know how to protect yourself and others

There is currently no specific, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for COVID-19, and there is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. Treatment is currently supportive. Therefore, the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Advice on preparation for COVID-19 and prevention of exposure to COVID-19 is available.

Continue with your routine care

Don’t stop any medications or change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.

Discuss any concerns about your treatment with your healthcare provider.

Ensure that you are obtaining the tests ordered by your healthcare provider.

Continue to get your routine immunizations.

Talk to your healthcare provider, insurer, and pharmacist about creating an emergency supply of prescription medications. Make sure that you have at least 30 days of prescription and over-the-counter medications and supplies on hand in case you need to stay home for a long time. Ask your healthcare provider if it is possible to obtain a 90-day supply of your prescription medications.

Make or update care plans or an emergency notebook. They typically include important information about a person’s medical conditions, how to manage those conditions, how to contact healthcare providers and therapists, allergies, information on medications (names, dosages, and administration instructions), preferences (food and other), and daily routines and activities. This may help you receive consistent care if your Direct Service Providers or family members are unavailable.

"If You Are Pregnant, Breastfeeding, or Caring for Young Children","COVID-19 and pregnancy

Based on what we know at this time, pregnant people might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 may be at increased risk for other adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth.

Take steps to protect yourself from COVID-19

There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible. In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

Here are preventive steps you and people you live with can take:

Limit close contact interactions with other people as much as possible.

When going out or interacting with others outside your immediate household, Wear a mask, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Note that wearing a mask is not a substitute for other everyday prevention actions like washing hands frequently and avoiding close contact with other people. Avoid others who are not wearing masks or ask others around you to wear a mask, if possible. Stay at least 6 feet away from others outside your household. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid activities where taking protective measures may be difficult and where social distancing can’t be maintained.

Continue to seek healthcare

Don’t skip your healthcare appointments during and after pregnancy.

Visit your healthcare provider for all recommended appointments. If you need help finding one, contact your nearest hospital clinic, community health center external icon , or health department.

, or health department. Talk to your healthcare provider about How to stay healthy and take care of yourself and your baby. Any questions you have about the best place to deliver your baby. Delivering your baby is always safest under the care of trained healthcare professionals.



If you’re concerned about going to your appointments because of COVID-19, ask your healthcare provider what steps they’re taking to separate healthy patients from those who may be sick.

Some healthcare providers may choose to cancel or postpone some visits.

Others may switch certain appointments to telemedicine visits, which are appointments over the phone or video.

These decisions may be based on the situation in your community as well as your individual health risks.

Get recommended vaccines and a 30-day supply of your medicines.

Getting the recommended vaccines during pregnancy can help protect you and your baby.

Get vaccinated against influenza (or flu). Flu and COVID-19 are both respiratory illnesses that can spread from person to person. They can affect breathing and have similar symptoms, but they are caused by different viruses (read more about similarities and differences between flu and COVID-19). It is unknown how these two viruses may interact during the upcoming flu season. There is no vaccine available to protect against the virus that causes COVID-19. You should protect yourself against flu by getting vaccinated. Others living in your household should also get vaccinated to protect themselves and you.

Get the whooping cough (Tdap) vaccine during pregnancy to protect your baby against whooping cough, which can also present with similar symptoms to COVID-19.

Ask your doctor and pharmacy to give you at least a 30-day supply of the medicines you need.

Call your healthcare provider if you have any health concerns.

These concerns may include:

You think you have COVID-19 (call within 24 hours).

You think you are experiencing depression during or after pregnancy.

You have any questions related to your health.

Don’t delay getting emergency care because of COVID-19.

Call 911 or go to your local emergency department.

If you are going to the emergency department, call and tell them that you are pregnant and are having an emergency. They should have a plan to protect you from getting COVID-19.

If someone else is driving, call while you’re on the way. If you need to drive yourself to the emergency department, call before you start driving.​

Caring for newborns when the mother has COVID-19

Much is still unknown about the risks of COVID-19 to newborns born to mothers with COVID-19. We do know that:

Infections causing COVID-19 in newborns born to mothers with COVID-19 are uncommon.

Some newborns have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 shortly after birth. It is unknown if these newborns got the virus before, during, or after birth from close contact with an infected person.

Most newborns who tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 had mild or no symptoms and recovered. However, there are a few reports of newborns with severe COVID-19 illness.

Preterm (less than 37 completed weeks gestation) birth and other problems with pregnancy and birth have been reported among women who tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy. It is unknown whether these problems were related to the virus that causes COVID-19.

Decide if your newborn is rooming-in with you in the hospital.

CDC recognizes that the ideal setting for the care of a healthy, full-term newborn during the birth hospitalization is within the mother’s room (“rooming-in”). Current evidence suggests that the risk of a newborn getting COVID-19 from its mother is low, especially when she uses appropriate precautions before and during care of the newborn, such as wearing a mask and practicing hand hygiene.

If you are diagnosed with or test positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, you should discuss with your healthcare provider the risks and benefits of having your newborn stay in the same room with you. This conversation should begin during prenatal care if possible. Having your newborn stay with you in the same room has the benefit of facilitating breastfeeding and maternal-newborn bonding. Potential risks may include giving the virus to the newborn, although current evidence suggests the risk of a newborn getting COVID-19 from their mother is low if precautions are taken. After discussing, make an informed decision of whether your newborn is staying in the same room with you while in the hospital.

Take precautions when having your newborn stay in the same room with you, if you are in isolation for COVID-19.

If you are in isolation for COVID-19 and are sharing a room with your newborn, take the following precautions to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to your newborn:

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before holding or caring for your newborn. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Wear a mask when within 6 feet of your newborn.

Keep your newborn more than 6 feet away from you as much as possible.

Discuss with your healthcare provider about using a physical barrier (for example, placing the newborn in an incubator) while in the hospital.

If your isolation period has ended, you should still wash your hands before caring for your newborn, but you don’t need to take the other precautions. You most likely won’t pass the virus to your newborn or any other close contacts after your isolation period has ended.

If you had symptoms, your isolation period ends after 10 days since symptoms first appeared, and 24 hours with no fever without fever-reducing medications, and Other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving

If you never had symptoms, your isolation period ends after 10 days since the date of your positive COVID-19 test



Take precautions at home if you are in isolation for COVID-19.

If you are still in isolation for COVID-19 and have returned home, take the following precautions until your isolation period has ended:

Stay home to separate yourself from others outside your home.

Consider isolating from other household members within your home who are not infected.

Have a healthy caregiver who is not at increased risk for severe illness provide care for your newborn. Caregivers should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds before touching your newborn. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. If the caregiver is living in the same home or has been in close contact with you, they should wear a mask when they are within 6 feet of your newborn for the entire time you are in isolation and for two weeks after you completed isolation.

If a healthy caregiver is not available, you can care for your newborn if you are well enough. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before touching for your newborn. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Wear a mask when within 6 feet of your newborn and other people during your entire isolation period. The mask helps prevent you from spreading the virus to others.



Others in your household and caregivers who have COVID-19 should isolate and avoid caring for the newborn as much as possible. If they have to care for the newborn, they should practice hand hygiene and wear a mask.

Do not put a face shield or mask on your baby.

A face shield could increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or accidental suffocation and strangulation. Babies move frequently. Their movement may cause the plastic face shield to block their nose and mouth, or cause the strap to strangle them.

There are also no data supporting the use of face shields among babies for protection against COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses.

CDC recommends all people 2 years of age and older wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household. CDC does not recommend use of face shields as a substitute for masks for the general public, including pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.

Ensure safe sleep for your baby.

Safe sleep is an important part of keeping babies healthy.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents of babies may experience increased stress and fatigue that could affect their ability to ensure that their baby is sleeping safely. Help reduce your baby’s risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and other sleep-related deaths by doing the following:

Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times – naps and at night.

Use a firm, flat sleep surface, such as a mattress in a crib covered by a fitted sheet.

Have the baby share your room but not your bed. Your baby shouldn’t sleep on an adult bed, cot, air mattress, couch, or chair, whether he or she is sleeping alone, with you, or with anyone else.

Keep soft bedding, such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys, out of your baby’s sleep area.

Do not cover your baby’s head or allow your baby to get too hot. Signs your baby may be getting too hot include sweating or his or her chest feeling hot.

Don’t smoke or allow anyone to smoke around your baby.

Learn more about how to reduce the risk of SIDS.

Bring your baby for newborn visits.

Ideally, newborn visits are done in person so that your baby’s healthcare provider can

Check how you and your baby are doing overall.

Check your baby’s growth and feeding.

Check your baby for jaundice.

Make sure your baby’s newborn screening tests were done (including a bloodspot, hearing test, and a test for critical congenital heart defects) and do any repeat or follow-up testing, if necessary.

Make sure to call and notify your baby’s healthcare provider before visiting if you or your baby have COVID-19.

COVID-19 and breastfeeding

Current evidence suggests that breast milk isn’t likely to spread the virus to babies.

You, along with your family and healthcare providers, should decide whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding. Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most babies. We don’t know for sure if mothers with COVID-19 can spread the virus to babies in breast milk, but the current evidence suggests that this isn’t likely.

Helpful tips for breastfeeding

You may find it harder to start or continue breastfeeding if you are not sharing a room with your newborn in the hospital. Here are some helpful tips:

Frequent hand expression or pumping, ideally with a hospital-grade pump, will help you establish and build milk supply if you are separated from your newborn.

Pump or feed every 2-3 hours (at least 8-10 times in 24 hours, including at night), especially in the first few days. This signals the breasts to produce milk and prevents blocked milk ducts and breast infections.

If you are unable to establish milk production in the hospital after birth, or have to temporarily stop breastfeeding during your COVID-19 illness because you do not feel well enough, get help from a lactation support provider. Learn more about relactation.

You should always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds before breastfeeding or expressing breast milk even if you don’t have COVID-19. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

If you have COVID-19 and choose to breastfeed

Wash your hands beforehand

People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. COVID-19 can affect your nose, throat, lungs (respiratory tract); cause an asthma attack; and possibly lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease.

Treatment

There is currently no preventive treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19.

Prepare for COVID-19

box tissue light icon Protect Your Health This Flu Season People at High Risk For Flu Complications Getting a flu vaccine during 2020-2021 is more important than ever because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk from flu; many of whom are also at high risk for COVID-19 or serious outcomes.

Follow your Asthma Action Plan

Any disinfectant can trigger an asthma attack.

Follow the recommendations below to reduce your chance of an asthma attack while disinfecting to prevent COVID-19.

If you have asthma, Ask an adult without asthma to clean and disinfect surfaces and objects for you. Stay in another room when cleaners or disinfectants are being used and right after their use. Use only cleaning products you must use. Some surfaces and objects that are seldom touched may need to be cleaned only with soap and water. Make a list of the urgent care or health facilities near you that provide nebulizer/asthma treatments. Keep it close to your phone If you have an asthma attack, move away from the trigger such as the disinfectant or the area that was disinfected. Follow your Asthma Action Plan. Call 911 for medical emergencies.

The person cleaning and disinfecting should: Follow recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting to prevent COVID-19. Choose disinfectants that are less likely to cause an asthma attack, using EPA’s list of approved products external icon such as: products with hydrogen peroxide (no stronger than 3%) or ethanol (ethyl alcohol) products that do NOT contain peroxyacetic acid or peracetic acid. Limit use of chemicals that can trigger asthma attacks, such as bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g. benzalkonium chloride), and do not use them in enclosed spaces. Follow additional precautions for cleaning and disinfecting places where people with asthma may be, to reduce exposure to asthma triggers.

Use products safely and correctly: Always read and follow the directions on the product label to ensure you are using it safely and effectively. Wear skin protection such as gloves and consider eye protection to protect yourself against splashes. Make sure there is enough air flow (ventilation). Use only the amount recommended on the label.

Wear Face Masks on Public Transportation Conveyances and at Transportation Hubs,"Traveling on public transportation conveyances increases a person’s risk of getting and spreading COVID-19 by bringing persons in close contact with others, often for prolonged periods, and exposing them to frequently touched surfaces. Air travel often requires spending time in security lines and busy airport terminals. Travel by bus, train, and other conveyances used for international, interstate, or intrastate transportation poses similar challenges. Social distancing is often difficult on public transportation. People may not be able to distance themselves by the recommended at least 6 feet from individuals seated nearby or those standing in or passing through the aisles on airplanes, trains, or buses.

Transmission of the virus through travelers has led to—and continues to lead to—interstate and international spread of the virus which causes COVID-19. Appropriately worn masks reduce the spread of COVID-19—particularly given the evidence of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of the virus.

CDC strongly recommends appropriate masks be worn by all passengers and by all personnel operating the conveyance while on public transportation conveyances (e.g., airplanes, ships, ferries, trains, subways, buses, taxis, ride-shares) and at transportation hubs and other locations where people board such conveyances (e.g. airports, bus or ferry terminals, train stations, seaports).

People should wear masks that cover both the mouth and nose when waiting for, traveling on, or departing from public conveyances. People should also wear masks at an airport, bus or ferry terminal, train or subway station, seaport, or similar area that provides transportation.

People should wear masks when traveling into, within, or out of the United States on public conveyances.

Conveyance operators transporting people should refuse to board anyone not wearing a mask and require all people onboard, whether passengers or employees, to wear masks for the duration of travel except in the following circumstances: for brief periods while eating, drinking, or taking medication; if unconscious, incapacitated, unable to be awakened, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance; and when necessary to temporarily remove the mask to verify one’s identity such as during Transportation Security Administration screening or when asked to do so by the ticket or gate agent or any law enforcement official for children under the age of 2 years old



Public transportation conveyance operators should ensure that any person on the conveyance wears a mask when boarding, disembarking, and for the duration of travel. Depending on the circumstances, conveyances operators should take the following actions:

provide information to people purchasing tickets or otherwise booking transportation (in advance or on the day of departure) about the need to wear a mask on the conveyance and that failure to comply will result in denial of boarding. Operators should provide this information again at the time of boarding;

board only those people who wear appropriate masks;

monitor the conveyance for any person who does not wear a mask and seek compliance from such person; and

at the earliest opportunity, disembark any person who refuses to comply

if possible, have masks available for those passengers who do not have a mask

Mask use may be exempted for the following categories of people:

a child under the age of 2 (masks should NOT be worn by children under the age of 2);

a person with written instructions from a licensed medical provider to not wear a mask;

a person with a disability, mental health condition, or sensory sensitivity that prevents that person from wearing a mask;

a person who is hearing impaired, or communicating with someone who is hearing impaired, when the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication;

a person for whom wearing a mask would create a risk to workplace health, safety, or job duty as determined by the relevant workplace safety guidelines or federal regulations; or

a person operating or essential to operating a conveyance for whom wearing a mask would interfere with that person’s ability to safely operate the conveyance.

Many countries, states, territories, tribes, and local authorities have implemented mask requirements within their jurisdictional boundaries, including on public conveyances and associated boarding terminals, to protect public health and reduce the spread of COVID-19 within and between communities. Transportation partners, including airlines, train and bus operators, and taxi and ride-share companies, have also issued mask requirements on their conveyances.

Broad and routine utilization of masks on our transportation systems will protect Americans and provide confidence that we can once again travel safely even during this pandemic. Therefore, CDC is providing this guidance to further support state and local health authorities, transportation partners, and conveyance operators who have implemented requirements for masks to support passenger and crew safety, maintain safe and operational transportation systems, mitigate further introduction and spread of COVID-19, and help safely re-open America’s economy.",##########,
Know When to Delay your Travel to Avoid Spreading COVID-19,"When to Delay your Travel

The COVID-19 pandemic may be stressful for people. Traveling with family or friends can be a stress reliever, but it also increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. You don’t want to miss out on a planned trip, but there are situations when cancelling or postponing travel makes sense for you and those you care about. Delaying your trip when you could spread COVID-19 also protects other travelers, people who work in travel settings, and those at your destination.

Check these common scenarios to see if you or your travel companions should delay your travel. This list does not include all possible situations. Talk to your health care provider before you travel if you are unsure whether any of these situations apply to you or your travel companions. CDC will continue to update this information as we learn more about COVID-19.

After You Travel,"There is ongoing transmission of novel coronavirus within the United States and in destinations throughout the world.

You may have been exposed to COVID-19 on your travels (domestic and/or international). You may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can be contagious without symptoms and spread the virus to others. You and your travel companions (including children) pose a risk to your family, friends, and community for 14 days after you were exposed to the virus. Regardless of where you traveled or what you did during your trip, take these actions to protect others from getting sick:

When around others, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people who are not from your household. It is important to do this everywhere, both indoors and outdoors.

Wear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when you are outside of your home, and including when using public transportation.

Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer.

Watch your health and look for symptoms of COVID-19. Take your temperature if you feel sick.

Follow state, territorial, tribal and local recommendations or requirements after travel.",##########,
Travelers Returning from Cruise Ship and River Cruise Voyages,"How CDC is helping cruise ship travelers Learn what CDC is doing to help cruise ship travelers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On October 30, 2020, CDC issued a Framework for Conditional Sailing Order for cruise ships operating or seeking to operate in U.S. waters.

CDC recommends that all people defer travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, worldwide. That’s because the risk of COVID-19 on cruise ships is high. People with an increased risk of serious illness should especially defer travel on cruise ships, including river cruises. CDC has issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice for cruise ship travel.

Passengers who decide to travel are advised to take extra precautions to protect others for 14 days after their return from a cruise ship or river cruise voyage:",##########,
Help Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in Children,"Wash hands

Make sure your child washes their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Read more and watch a video on how to wash hands correctly.

If soap and water are not readily available, make sure your child uses a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Teach your child to cover all surfaces of their hands with hand sanitizer and rub their hands together until they feel dry. If your child is under 6 years of age, supervise them when they use hand sanitizer.

You, as a parent, guardian, or caretaker, play an important role in teaching your child to wash their hands.

Explain that handwashing can keep them healthy and stop germs from spreading to others.

Be a good role model — if you wash your hands as recommended, they’re more likely to do the same.

Make handwashing a family activity.

Practice cough and sneeze etiquette by covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing, throwing the tissue in the closest garbage can, and washing your hands after you throw it away.

Avoid close contact

Keep your child at least 6 feet away from others who don’t live with them and those who are sick (such as coughing and sneezing).

Limit in-person playtime and connect virtually with other children

CDC recognizes this pandemic has been stressful to many. Socializing and interacting with peers can be a healthy way for children to cope with stress and connect with others. However, the key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit close contact with others as much as possible.

An important guiding principle to remember is that the more people your child interacts with, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. While your child may be spending time with other people as they return to childcare or school settings, you should limit your child’s interactions with additional children and adults outside of childcare or school to decrease risk.

For playdates, the risk of COVID-19 increases as follows:

Lowest risk: No in-person playdates. Children connect virtually (via phone calls and video chats).

No in-person playdates. Children connect virtually (via phone calls and video chats). Medium risk: Infrequent playdates with the same family or friend who is also practicing everyday preventive measures. Children maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other during the playdate. ​Playdates are held outdoors. (Indoor spaces are more risky than outdoor space where there is less ventilation and it might be harder to keep children apart.)

Infrequent playdates with the same family or friend who is also practicing everyday preventive measures. Children maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other during the playdate. ​Playdates are held outdoors. (Indoor spaces are more risky than outdoor space where there is less ventilation and it might be harder to keep children apart.) Highest Risk: Frequent indoor playdates with multiple friends or families who are not practicing everyday preventive measures. Children do not maintain a distance of 6 feet from each other.

To help your child maintain social connections while social distancing, help them have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends.

Limit your child’s interaction with people at highest risk of severe illness from COVID-19

To protect those who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, you may consider taking these extra precautions.

Separate your child from others in your household who have an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Carefully consider who might be best to provide childcare if you are unable to care for your child (for example, you are not able to stay with your child while childcare or school is closed).

Limit your child’s contact with other people if someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (such as an older adult or someone with an underlying medical condition).

Postpone visits or trips to see grandparents, older family members and family members who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Consider connecting virtually or by writing letters.

Wear a mask

Children 2 years of age and older should wear a mask.

Help your child (if 2 years of age or older) wear a mask correctly when in public and when around people they don’t live with.

CDC recognizes that wearing masks may not be possible in every situation or for some people. Correct and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some children, such as children with certain disabilities, including cognitive, intellectual, developmental, sensory and behavioral disorders. Learn more about what you can do if your child or you cannot wear masks in certain situations.

Note that wearing a mask is not a substitute for other everyday prevention actions, like avoiding close contact with others and washing hands frequently.

Clean & disinfect

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily

Frequently touched surfaces include tables, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets, and sinks.

Clean with detergent or soap and water.

Then disinfect with EPA-registered household disinfectants external icon .

Wash items, including washable plush toys as needed

Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.

Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely.

You can wash dirty laundry from a sick person together with other people’s items.

Learn more about cleaning and disinfecting your home.

Consider changing travel plans

Because travel increases your child’s chances of coming in contact with others who may have COVID-19 and your child spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to others if they are infected, staying home is the best way to protect your child and others from getting sick.

We don’t know if one type of travel is safer than others. Any place where travelers interact with other people (for example, airports, bus stations, train stations, gas stations, restaurants, and rest stops) are places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces. It can also be hard to stay at least 6 feet apart from other people during travel. Learn more about Travel During COVID-19.",##########,
Keep Children Healthy during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Teach and reinforce everyday preventive actions

Wash hands

Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, and encourage your child to do the same. Read more and watch a video on how to wash hands correctly.

If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Teach your child to cover all surfaces of their hands with hand sanitizer and rub their hands together until they feel dry. If your child is under 6 years of age, supervise them when they use hand sanitizer.

Wear a mask

Make sure everyone in your household wears a mask (if 2 years of age or older) when in public and when around people who don’t live in your household. Ensure your child wears their masks correctly and safely.

Some children may find it challenging to wear a mask. If your child finds it challenging, you can consider alternatives.

Avoid close contact

Make sure your child and everyone else in your household keep at least 6 feet away from other people who don’t live with them and people who are sick (such as coughing and sneezing).

Cover coughs and sneezes

When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, throw your tissue in closest garbage can, and wash your hands. Encourage your child and all household members to do the same.

Bring your child for their healthcare visits

Routine well-child visits and vaccine visits are essential, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prepare for your child’s healthcare visits

Call your child’s healthcare provider to ask about any upcoming appointments or to ask when your child’s vaccinations are due.

Ask your child’s healthcare provider what steps they are taking to separate healthy patients from those who may be sick. Some healthcare providers may choose to delay in-person visits, which will be based on the situation in your community and your child’s individual care plan.

Notify your child’s healthcare provider before your visit if you or your child have any symptoms of COVID-19.

Bring your child for well-child visits and vaccine visits

Your child’s healthcare provider will check your child’s growth and development at well-child visits. You can also track your child’s developmental milestones with CDC’s free Milestone Tracker app.

Vaccines are an important part of keeping your child healthy by protecting them against vaccine-preventable diseases. There are effective vaccines for illnesses such as measles, flu (influenza), whooping cough (pertussis), and other diseases that can spread from person to person. Although there is not yet a vaccine to help protect against COVID-19, your child should receive all of their recommended vaccines.

Get a flu vaccine by the end of October

A flu vaccine is the single best way to prevent flu.

CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older get a flu vaccine each year by the end of October (with rare exceptions). You and your child can get a flu vaccine during healthcare visits, or you can find additional locations at vaccinefinder.orgexternal icon.

Getting a flu vaccine can reduce the likelihood of your child getting sick, being hospitalized, or dying from flu. You and your family getting a flu vaccine will also help protect others around you who may be more vulnerable to severe illness from flu, like babies and young children, older adults, pregnant people, and those with certain medical conditions.

It is especially important for this upcoming flu season to help prevent over-burdening the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 and flu are both infectious illnesses that can affect breathing and have similar symptoms, but they are caused by different viruses. Learn more about similarities and differences between flu and COVID-19.

Ensure Children's Wellbeing During COVID-19: Parental Resources,"Conversation Starters

Get immediate help in a crisis and find a health care provider or treatment for substance use disorder and mental health.

Children and young people can be particularly overwhelmed by stress related to a traumatic event, like the COVID-19 pandemic. They may show stress through increased anxiety, fear, sadness or worry. When children and young people are struggling to cope with stress, they may exhibit unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, changes in activity level, substance use or other risk behaviors, and difficulty with attention and concentration.

Parents, caregivers, and other trusted adults can serve as sources of social connectedness; they can provide stability, support, and open communication. They can also help children and young people express the many different feelings and thoughts on their mind.

Here are some quick ideas for how to get conversations started with children and young people about how they are feeling and what they are struggling with regarding COVID-19. You don’t have to use these exact words—you know best how to speak with your child, adolescent or youth. In addition, how we talk to children and young people varies depending on their age and developmental level.

COVID-19 is a new disease, which can be confusing. Do you have any questions about it? If I don’t know the answer, I can try to find it or maybe we could search for it together.

People can be angry, sad, or worried when something bad happens. Those feelings can make you feel confused or uncomfortable. Tell me what you have been feeling since the changes started.

What worries you most about COVID-19?

Have you been feeling nervous about going back to school because of COVID-19?

Wearing masks and staying at a distance from others is not something we were used to doing. How do you feel about that?

When our minds are stuck on bad things, it can be really hard to focus on other things. Have you ever felt this way? What kinds of things does your mind get stuck on?

Is there anything that you are looking forward to, for when we can connect in-person more safely and return to more normal activities—like a vacation, movie, graduation or playing on a sports team? Tell me about what that might look like!

Some of these conversation starters are used in Psychological First Aid (PFA)pdf iconexternal icon – an approach commonly used among disaster survivors to cope with trauma. PFA can be useful for parents to help children and young people cope by enabling and maintaining environments that promote safety, calmness, connectedness to others, self-efficacy (empowerment), and hopefulness. Remember: It’s okay not to have an answer, just being there to listen in a non-judgmental way can be helpful!

At-Home Scavenger Hunt,"Ready? Set… Go! Children, adolescents, and adults can join this fun At-Home Scavenger Hunt. After finding each item, talk about its importance in keeping children and families safe and healthy. Special playtimes can help parents build strong, nurturing relationships with their children.

Who can play?

Scavenger hunts can be a fun activity for children, adolescents and adults. Consider the age of the participants, where you are playing, and the type of items you will be looking for. This At-Home Scavenger Hunt is recommended for children ages 6 years and older, adolescents, and adults within the same household. You may decide to play as individual players or teams. You can assist younger children in safely searching for items.

Where to play?

This activity is designed to be played indoors, at home. Prior to starting, you should decide where in the home you want to play—all around the home or only in specific rooms or areas.

Safety first!

Follow everyday safety precautions when searching for items around the house. Watch your step. Use handrails when going up or down the stairs. Do not climb over objects. No matter the number of players and their ages – safety first! If anyone who does not live in the same household is playing, be sure all players keep their distance (6 ft apart) and wear a mask.

Scoring sheet

The Scoring Sheetpdf icon (españolpdf icon) includes the list of items to be searched for and the points assigned to each item. Keep in mind, not all items are worth the same amount of points… it can be anybody’s game until the very end! Discussion questions per item are also included to promote conversation among players about staying physically, socially, emotionally and mentally healthy during COVID-19.

How to play?

Decide if you are playing individually or as teams. If teams, assign players to each team. Specify the areas of the home in which you are playing. Assign a facilitator to lead the scavenger hunt. The facilitator will open, download or print the materials for the game. The list of items to be searched for, and discussion questions are found on the scoring sheet. Score can be kept on a separate piece of paper or the printed scoring sheet. The facilitator will announce the item to be searched for. The first player or team to bring the item to the facilitator wins that round. The facilitator then reads the discussion question for that item, and players share their thoughts. Repeat steps 5-7 until all items have been searched for. The facilitator will add up each player’s or team’s points. The player or team with the highest score wins the game.

Children and COVID-19

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can affect children, adolescents and young adults directly and indirectly. Beyond getting sick, their social, emotional, and mental wellbeing has been impacted by the pandemic. Trauma faced at each developmental stage can continue to affect individuals across their lifespan.

Mental Health and Coping During COVID-19,"Know the facts to help reduce stress

Knowing the facts about COVID-19 and stopping the spread of rumors can help reduce stress and stigma. Understanding the risk to yourself and people you care about can help you connect with others and make an outbreak less stressful.

Take care of your mental health

Mental health is an important part of overall health and wellbeing. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It may also affect how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices during an emergency.

People with pre-existing mental health conditions or substance use disorders may be particularly vulnerable in an emergency. Mental health conditions (such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia) affect a person’s thinking, feeling, mood or behavior in a way that influences their ability to relate to others and function each day. These conditions may be situational (short-term) or long-lasting (chronic). People with preexisting mental health conditions should continue with their treatment and be aware of new or worsening symptoms. If you think you have new or worse symptoms, call your healthcare provider.

Call your healthcare provider if stress gets in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row. Free and confidential resources can also help you or a loved one connect with a skilled, trained counselor in your area.

Suicide

Different life experiences affect a person’s risk for suicide. For example, suicide risk is higher among people who have experienced violence, including child abuse, bullying, or sexual violence. Feelings of isolation, depression, anxiety, and other emotional or financial stresses are known to raise the risk for suicide. People may be more likely to experience these feelings during a crisis like a pandemic.

However, there are ways to protect against suicidal thoughts and behaviors. For example, support from family and community, or feeling connected, and having access to in-person or virtual counseling or therapy can help with suicidal thoughts and behavior, particularly during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reducing Stigma,"Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

No single person or group of people are more likely than others to spread COVID-19. Public health emergencies, such as this pandemic, are stressful times for people and communities. Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to social stigma, which is negative attitudes and beliefs toward people, places, or things. Stigma can lead to labeling, stereotyping, discriminationexternal icon, and other negative behaviors toward others. For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people link a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population, community, or nationality. Stigma can also happen after a person has recovered from COVID-19 or been released from home isolation or quarantine.

Some groups of people who may experience stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic include:

Certain racial and ethnic minority groups, including Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and black or African Americans;

People who tested positive for COVID-19, have recovered from being sick with COVID-19, or were released from COVID-19 quarantine;

Emergency responders or healthcare providers;

Other frontline workers, such as grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, or farm and food processing plant workers;

People who have disabilities or developmental or behavioral disorders who may have difficulty following recommendations;

People who have underlying health conditions that cause a cough;

People living in congregate (group) settings, such as people experiencing homelessness.

Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem. Stigma can also make people more likely to hide symptoms or illness, keep them from seeking health care immediately, and prevent individuals from adopting healthy behaviors. This means that stigma can make it more difficult to control the spread of an outbreak.

Groups who experience stigma may also experience discrimination. This discrimination can take the form of:

Other people avoiding or rejecting them;

Getting denied healthcare, education, housing, or employment;

Verbal abuse; or

Physical violence.

Stigma can negatively affect the emotional, mental, and physical health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stigmatized individuals may experience isolation, depression, anxiety, or public embarrassment. Stopping stigma is important to making all communities and community members safer and healthier. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in their communities.

Grief and Loss,"If you have lost a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic

Grieving the loss of a loved one while coping with the fear and anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic can be especially overwhelming. Social distancing, “stay-at home-orders,” and limits on the size of in-person gatherings have changed the way friends and family can gather and grieve, including holding traditional funeral services, regardless of whether or not the person’s death was due to COVID-19. However, these types of prevention strategies are important to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Some actions you can take to help you cope with feelings of grief after the loss of a loved include:

Connecting with other people Invite people to call you or host conference calls with family members and friends to stay connected. Ask family and friends to share stories and pictures with you via mailed letters, email, phone, or video chat or via apps or social media that allow groups to share with each other (e.g., group chat, group messaging, Facebook). Coordinate a date and time for family and friends to honor your loved one by reciting a selected poem, spiritual reading, or prayer within their own households.

Creating memories or rituals. Develop a virtual memory book, blog, or webpage to remember your loved one, and ask family and friends to contribute their memories and stories. Take part in an activity, such as planting a tree or preparing a favorite meal, that has significance to you and the loved one who died.

Asking for help from others Seek out grief counseling or mental health services, support groups, or hotlines, especially those that can be offered over the phone or online. Seek spiritual support from faith-based organizations, including your religious leaders and congregations, if applicable. Seek support from other trusted community leaders and friends.



During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family and close friends of a person who died of COVID-19 may experience stigma, such as social avoidance or rejection. Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger towards other people. Some people may avoid contacting you, your family members, and friends when they would normally reach out to you. Stigma related to COVID-19 is less likely to occur when people know the facts and share them with extended family, friends, and others in your community.

If you feel distress from other types of loss or change

During the COVID-19 pandemic, you may feel grief due to loss of a job; inability to connect in-person with friends, family or religious organizations; missing special events and milestones (such as graduations, weddings, vacations); and experiencing drastic changes to daily routines and ways of life that bring comfort. You may also feel a sense of guilt for grieving over losses that seem less important than loss of life. Grief is a universal emotion; there is no right or wrong way to experience it, and all losses are significant.

Here are some ways to cope with feelings of grief:

Acknowledge your losses and your feelings of grief. Find ways to express your grief. Some people express grief and find comfort through art, gardening, writing, talking to friends or family, cooking, music, gardening or other creative practices.

Consider developing new rituals in your daily routine to stay connected with your loved ones to replace those that have been lost. People who live together may consider playing board games and exercising together outdoors. People who live alone or are separated from their loved ones may consider interacting through phone calls and apps that allow for playing games together virtually.

If you are worried about future losses, try to stay in the present and focus on aspects of your life that you have control over right now.

Helping children cope with grief

Children may show griefpdf iconexternal icon differently than adults. Children may have a particularly hard time understanding and coping with the loss of a loved one. Sometimes children appear sad and talk about missing the person or act out. Other times, they play, interact with friends, and do their usual activities. As a result of measures taken to limit the spread of COVID-19, they may also grieve over loss of routines such as going to school and playing with friends. Parents and other caregivers play an important role in helping children process their grief.

To support a child who may be experiencing grief:

Ask questions to determine the child’s emotional state and better understand their perceptions of the event.

Give children permission to grieve by allowing time for children to talk or to express thoughts or feelings in creative ways.

Provide age and developmentally appropriate answers.

Practice calming and coping strategies with your child.

Take care of yourself and model coping strategies for your child.

Maintain routines as much as possible.

Spend time with your child, reading, coloring, or doing other activities they enjoy.

Signs that children may need additional assistance include changes in their behavior (such as acting out, not interested in daily activities, changes in eating and sleeping habits, persistent anxiety, sadness, or depression). Speak to your child’s healthcare provider if troubling reactions seem to go on too long, interfere with school or relationships with friends or family, or if you are unsure of or concerned about how your child is doing.",##########,

What you can do

Consider healthier options for stress and coping such as exercise, meditation, or reaching out to friends and family.

What states and communities can do

Support evidence-based prevention of excessive drinking. Greater availability and accessibility of alcohol is linked with excessive alcohol drinking. Many states and communities are providing additional options for delivery and takeaway of alcoholic beverages. The Community Preventive Services Task Forceexternal icon recommends limiting the availability of alcohol to lower excessive alcohol use and its impacts. It also recommends enforcing laws that prohibit sales to minors, which may be difficult with home delivery of alcohol.

What healthcare providers can do

Screen all adult patients for excessive drinking.

Advise patients who screen positive for drinking too much to drink less (and refer people who might have an alcohol use disorder to specialized treatment).

Screen all adults for substance use and refer people who might have a substance use disorder to specialized treatment.

Basics of excessive alcohol use

Drinking too much can be harmful to your health. Most people who drink excessively are not alcoholics or alcohol dependent. Excessive alcohol use includes binge drinking, which is defined as five or more drinks on an occasion (within two or three hours) for men, and four or more drinks on an occasion (within two or three hours) for women. Other forms of excessive alcohol use include heavy drinking (15 or more drinks a week for men, eight or more drinks a week for women), and any drinking by pregnant people or people younger than 21 years. Excessive alcohol use leads to more than 95,000 deaths each year in the United States.

Excessive alcohol use increases the risk for violence, injuries, and motor vehicle crashes. It can also increase the risk of long-term health issues such as liver disease, cancer, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and birth defects.",##########,
Support for People Experiencing Abuse,"Some of the public health actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 include avoiding large and small gatherings in private places and public spaces, working remotely, and closing schools. While these measures are critical for slowing the spread of COVID-19, they may contribute to an increase in violence and suicide due to:

Social isolation or lack of social support

Financial, emotional, or physical stress

Lack of time alone or lack of physical and mental space

Lack of childcare

Loss of job or income

Depression or anxiety

Substance misuse

Reduced access to mental health or substance use services and supports

In addition, social distancing measures can lead to more time in the home or in the same space as an abuser, increasing the risk for abuse. This can include child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse. Victims of violence may be unable to access help due to limited outside social contact, or they may not be able to seek victim services or shelter. The COVID-19 pandemic may also impact those experiencing violence in the following ways:

Abusers may further isolate and control victims of violence.

Abusers may share misinformation about the pandemic to control or frighten victims or prevent them from seeking medical treatment, if they need it.

Programs that serve victims, such as shelters and counseling centers, may be full or unable to assist them. Victims may fear entering shelters for fear of being exposed to COVID-19.

Travel restrictions may impact a victim’s escape or safety plan.

Support For Teens and Young Adults,"Some of the questions you might be asking are, “Should I be freaking out about COVID-19?” and “Why can’t I hang out with my friends in person?”. You may be feeling worried, bored, or frustrated. COVID-19 is frightening, and you are not the only one feeling stressed.

While anyone can catch the virus that causes COVID-19 and people of all ages and backgrounds can get severely ill, most people have a mild illness and are able to recover at home. But regardless of your personal risk, it is natural to be concerned for your friends and family or about uncertainty and changes in your daily routine.

There are things you can do to manage your stress.

Learn about COVID-19. Knowing the facts and stopping the spread of rumors about COVID-19 can help you feel more in control of what is happening.

Help stop the spread of COVID-19 by washing your hands often with soap and water, covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding close contact with other people – even your friends. COVID-19 may be spread by people who do not have symptoms. These actions will keep you from getting sick and spreading the virus to other people you care about.

Wear masks when you do leave your home to help slow the spread of COVID-19. People who should not wear a mask are children under age 2 and anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

You can be social, but do it from a distance, such as reaching out to friends by phone, text, video chat, and social media.

Find ways to relax. Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate external icon . Try to do activities you enjoy, like exercising, gaming, reading or other hobbies.

Suicide

Different life experiences may affect the risk for suicide. For example, suicide risk is higher for those who have experienced violence, including child abuse, bullying, or sexual violence. Feelings of isolation, depression, anxiety, and other emotional or financial stresses are known to raise the risk for suicide. You may be more likely to experience these feelings during a crisis like a pandemic.

You may be particularly overwhelmed when stress is connected to a traumatic event—like a natural disaster or pandemic. Parents and educators can provide stability and support to help you feel better.

There are ways to protect against suicidal thoughts and behaviors. For example, support from family and community, or feeling connected. Reach out to others online, through social media, video chat, or by phone. Having access to in-person or virtual counseling or therapy can help with suicidal thoughts and behavior, particularly during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Funeral Guidance for Individuals and Families,"Grieving the loss of a loved one during the fear and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic can be overwhelming. It may be difficult for people to make decisions about how to safely grieve and honor their loved one. This guidance is for individuals and families as they work with funeral directors, community and religious leaders, and others to plan and hold funeral services and visitations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19 by following these guiding principles.

Guiding Principles

The more people interact, the closer in distance the interaction is (less than 6 feet), and the longer the interaction lasts, the higher the risk of spreading COVID-19.

The higher the level of community transmission in an area, the higher the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Masks help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19, particularly if social distancing cannot be maintained.

During an in-person gathering, convene in outdoors or in well-ventilated areas, if possible, rather than poorly ventilated, indoor areas to help lower risk of spreading COVID-19. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor gatherings.

Avoid sharing commonly used objects such as religious aids (e.g., religious books, collection plates, programs, etc.,) to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Reducing the number of people who are engaged in activities like singing or chanting as these behaviors can increase the amount of respiratory virus in the air.

Practice increased hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and objects to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Practice social distancing by maintaining at least 6 feet between attendees; facility or lay staff; and clergy or officiants, especially when small, in-person services are held.

Take extra precautions for those at increased risk for COVID-19, particularly those who are older or have pre-existing conditions, to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.

The risk of COVID-19 spreading at gatherings and services is ranked as follows, from lowest to highest:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only services and gatherings.

Lower risk: Smaller outdoor, in-person services and gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear masks, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).

Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person services and gatherings, either indoors or outdoors, adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, with some individuals wearing face masks and with some attendees coming from outside the local area. Sharing of items or objects is limited.

Highest risk: Large in-person services and gatherings held indoors and where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart; many attendees travel from outside the local area. Few individuals wear masks and objects are shared.

In some situations, many people have become sick with COVID-19 after attending a funeral service. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in communities, changes need to be made to the way funerals, visitations, and memorials to the deceased are held. This guidance provides strategies to protect yourself and others when you are grieving the loss of a loved one, supporting each other, making funeral arrangements, and participating in funeral services and visitations. Some examples include:

Using technology to connect virtually with family and friends during the grieving process.

Considering modified funeral arrangements, such as limiting attendance at funerals held during shortly after the time of death to a small number of immediate family members and friends; and then holding additional memorial services when social distancing guidelines are less restrictive.

Practicing social distancing by maintaining at least 6 feet between attendees, facility staff, and clergy or officiants when small, in-person services are held.

Considering modifications to funeral rites and rituals (for example, avoid touching the deceased person’s body or personal belongings or other ceremonial objects) to make sure of everyone’s safety.

Wearing masks while around others and outside of your home.

Grieving the loss of a loved one

Grief is a normal response to losing someone important to you. When a loved one dies, it is important for friends and family to be able to share stories and memories of the person and how they influenced their lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the ability of friends and family to come together in person and grieve in typical ways. This is true regardless of whether the person’s death was due to COVID-19 or some other cause.

Given the COVID-19 pandemic, hosting gatherings now could be dangerous to those who would want to participate. Family and friends are finding alternate ways to connect, support each other, and grieve after their loss. They understand the need to possibly plan for additional memorial services when COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted.

Take actions to help you cope with the loss of a loved one

Grief is a universal emotion, but no two people experience grief in exactly the same way. Some actions you can take to help you cope with feelings of grief while practicing social distancing and honoring your loved one include:

Invite people to call you, or host conference calls with family members and friends to stay connected.

Ask family and friends to share stories and pictures with you via phone, video chat, email, text message, photo sharing apps, social media, or mailed letters.

Create a virtual memory book, blog, or webpage to remember your loved one, and ask family and friends to contribute their memories and stories.

Coordinate a date and time for family and friends to honor your loved one by reciting a selected poem, spiritual reading, or prayer from within their own households. Some cultures practice a prolonged mourning period with multiple observances, so hosting virtual events now and in-person events later may be in keeping with these practices.

Seek spiritual support from faith-based organizations, including religious leaders and congregations, if applicable. People who are not part of a faith tradition or religious community can seek support from other trusted community leaders and friends.

Use grief counseling services, support groups, or hotlines external icon , especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider.

, especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider. Read books about grief and loss. If you have children, read age-appropriate books with them and talk with them about how they are feeling.

Take part in an activity that has significance to you and the loved one you have lost, such as planting flowers or a tree or preparing a favorite meal, in memory of your loved one.

Review additional information from CDC on loss and grief, and ways to cope with stress and anxiety.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family and close friends of a person who died of COVID-19 may experience stigma, such as people avoiding them or rejecting them. Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger toward other people. Some people may avoid contact with you, your family members, and friends when they would normally reach out to you. You can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with extended family, friends, and others in your community.

Making Funeral Arrangements COVID-19 does not need to affect whether the funeral takes place through burial or cremation. Wishes of your deceased family member or friend may continue to be honored.

In general, there is no need to delay funeral services and visitations due to COVID-19. However, some changes to traditional practices are likely needed. Family members may need to discuss timing of services with funeral service providers, who may be overwhelmed.

Family members may need to discuss timing of services with funeral service providers, who may be overwhelmed. COVID-19 is a new disease, and we are still learning how it spreads. There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral service or visitation with the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 after the body has been prepared for viewing.

Take precautions when planning and holding funeral services and visitations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among those in attendance, including those who may not have symptoms.

Practice social distancing while making funeral arrangements

Consider having virtual or phone meetings instead of in-person meetings with funeral home staff, cemetery staff, clergy or officiants, and others to plan funeral arrangements.

If you need to meet in person, follow everyday preventive actions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19, such as wearing a mask, social distancing, washing your hands often, and covering coughs and sneezes.

Do not attend in-person meetings if you are sick or if you might have been exposed to COVID-19. Those who have higher risk of severe illness should weigh the benefits of in-person attendance against risk of exposure to a person with COVID-19, especially if recommendations for wearing masks and social distancing may be difficult to follow for themselves or others.

Discuss options for making changes to traditional funeral plans

Discuss your cultural or religious traditions and the funeral wishes of the deceased, if applicable, with family members and the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiants). Identify any potential concerns and determine options to make changes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Preserve traditional practices when it is possible to safely do so, and identify whether modified or new practices could satisfy the needs and values of you and your loved one.

Consider whether it would be acceptable to hold modified funeral arrangements by limiting attendance to a small number of immediate family members and friends shortly after the time of death. Consider holding additional memorial services in the future when social distancing guidelines are less restrictive. When you are making decisions about who should attend, consider how emotionally difficult social distancing practices might be for attendees (such as keeping at least 6 feet apart and not hugging other attendees who do not live in their household).

Ask the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiant) about resources they may be able to provide, such as: Virtual funeral services, visitations, and memorial tributes by online video streaming or recorded video. Consider potential issues with virtual attendees’ access to technology and high-speed internet, as well as how any technological difficulties during the service could impact the event. Online guestbooks or memory books that invite people to share stories, notes of condolence, or photos. Assistance with sharing details about the plan for funeral services and visitations with extended family and friends, including how to compassionately communicate any changes to traditional practices and the reasons they are necessary.



Holding funeral services and visitations

Familial and cultural expectations might put pressure on you and others to participate in or hold or schedule funeral services and visitations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, those expectations may need to be relaxed to protect the safety of those who would have participated. People continue to get exposed to COVID-19 at funeral services; the people giving it to others were not feeling sick at the time and did not know they were carrying or spreading COVID-19.

Consider the following modifications to funeral services and visitations to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These modifications are recommended for events held in any setting, including funeral homes, cemetery facilities, places of worship, private homes, and other venues.

Limit the attendees to a small number of immediate family and close friends

Follow the guidelines from state and local officials and state and local external icon health departments.

health departments. Those who are sick, have a household member or other close contact who is sick. Those who have higher risk of severe illness should weigh the benefits of in-person attendance against risk of exposure to a person with COVID-19, especially if recommendations for wearing masks and social distancing may be difficult to follow for themselves or others

Consider limiting the number of people from different areas of the country or any areas with significant spread of COVID-19.

Consider offering other ways for family and friends to participate, such as by phone or online (live or recorded).

Practice social distancing and everyday preventive actions

Consider holding services and gatherings in a large, well-ventilated area or outdoors, as circumstances and traditions allow.

Space out seating for attendees who do not live in the same household to at least 6 feet apart between household groups.

Attendees who do not live in the same household should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart and wear a mask when interacting with people who do not live in their household.

People who have been living in the same household can comfort each other in typical ways such as hugging, holding hands, and sitting next to each other.

Attendees should nod, bow, or wave instead of holding or shaking hands, hugging, or kissing anyone who does not live in their household.

Consider limiting the number of people engaged in activities that produce respiratory droplets, which may contain virus, (e.g., singing or chanting) especially when participants are indoors and in close proximity to each other. If attendees choose to sing or chant, encourage them to wear masks and increase distance between people to greater than 6 feet.

All attendees should follow everyday preventive actions to protect themselves and others from COVID-19, such as washing your hands often and covering coughs and sneezes.

Consider changing traditional rituals or practices

Discuss with the funeral home director, clergy or officiant, and your family any potential changes that might be necessary to protect all of the participants and attendees. Consider options for modified or new practices that would be acceptable to you and your family and friends, such as:

Holding a graveside-only service.

Changing or removing funeral practices that involve close contact or sharing things among members of different households, such as: Sharing a car or limousine ride between the church and cemetery. Providing food and beverages for attendees after the service.

Changing religious rituals in consultation with clergy and other religious leaders.

If some traditions, such as certain religious rituals, sharing rides to the gravesite, or having food and beverages, are considered essential to you and your family and friends, consider modifying them.

Limit sharing of items, such as worship aids, prayer books, and other items shared or passed by clergy and attendees during religious rituals.

Group household members together inside the vehicle. Avoid having non-household members sharing vehicles to travel between locations during the services; if necessary, increase ventilation by opening windows or using the air conditioner on non-recirculating mode.

If food is offered at a reception, have individual pre-packaged boxes or bags instead of a potluck, buffet, or family-style meal. Avoid sharing of foods and utensils.

In some cultures, bringing food or gifts to grieving family members is an important way to express care and concern. During the COVID-19 pandemic, consider expressing care in ways that do not involve personal interactions. Consider delivering food or gifts to grieving family members in ways that keep people at least 6 feet apart, mailing care packages, or giving families gift cards for food delivery services.

Avoid touching the deceased person’s body before preparation

There are many different cultural traditions involved in the bereavement process, including some that involve touching the deceased person’s body before preparation. Though we are still learning more about how COVID-19 spreads, it may be possible that you could get COVID-19 by touching the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 prior to the body being prepared for viewing. After the body has been prepared for viewing, there may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging.

Take steps to protect yourself, such as:

Avoid touching, hugging, or kissing the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 before and during body preparation, especially if you or a member of your household are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after any contact with the body. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Take precautions with rituals that involve touching the deceased person’s body

If the deceased person had confirmed or suspected COVID-19, avoid kissing, washing, or shrouding the body before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. Take precautions if participating in these activities is part of important religious or cultural practices.

Work with your cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff to identify how to reduce exposure as much as possible.

People at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and members of their household should not be involved in these activities.

People conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves (nitrile, latex, or rubber). Additional protective equipment may also be required, such as disposable and waterproof isolation gowns, face shields or goggles, and facemasks (e.g., if splashing of fluids is expected).

Following preparation of the body, safely remove gloves (and other protective equipment, if used) and throw them away. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Shower as soon as possible.

If you did not wear an isolation gown while preparing the body, wash your clothes in the warmest setting possible and dry them completely.

If removing personal possessions (such as wedding rings) from the body or casket, clean and disinfect external icon the items and wash hands right away.

Safely gather your loved one’s belongings

If desired, you may retrieve the belongings of a loved one who has died of COVID-19 outside their home (for example, in a hospital setting). Depending on local rules and regulations, family members may retrieve these belongings at the funeral home or the healthcare facility.

You should use gloves and practice good hand hygiene when handling your loved ones’ belongings. Depending on the type of belongings, such as electronics, you should also follow the household item-specific cleaning and disinfection guidelines when handling these items.",##########,
COVID-19 and Animals,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, infect only animals and do not infect humans.

Risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people

Some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to humans and then spread between people, but this is rare. This is what happened with the virus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19, with the virus likely originating in bats. The first reported infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person to person.

The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking. Recent studies show that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.

Risk of people spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to animals

The first US case of an animal testing positive for COVID-19 was a tiger at a NY zoo.

We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations, especially after close contact with a person sick with COVID-19.

For information on how to protect pets from possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, see If You Have Pets.

Animals that can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19

We know that cats, dogs, and a few other types of animals can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but we don’t yet know all of the animals that can get infected. There have been reports of animals being infected with the virus worldwide.

A small number of pet cats and dogs have been reported to be infected with the virus in several countries, including the United States. Most of these pets became sick after contact with people with COVID-19.

Several lions and tigers external icon at a New York zoo tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after showing signs of respiratory illness.

Public health officials believe these large cats became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected with SARS-CoV-2. All of these large cats have fully recovered. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in mink (which are closely related to ferrets) on multiple farms in the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, and the United States external icon . SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed mink has been characterized by respiratory disease and an increased mortality rate. Because some workers on these farms had symptoms of COVID-19, it is likely that infected farm workers were the source of the mink infections. Currently, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to people. However, reports from infected mink farms in the Netherlands suggest that in these environments there is the possibility for spread of SARS-CoV-2 from mink to humans. Additionally, some farm cats and dogs on mink farms in Europe also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting they had been exposed to the virus.

.

CDC, USDA, and state public health and animal health officials are working in some states to conduct active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in pets, including cats, dogs, and other small mammals, that had contact with a person with COVID-19. These animals are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and also tested to see whether the pet develops antibodies to this virus. This work is being done to help us better understand how common SARS-CoV-2 infection might be in pets as well as the possible role of pets in the spread of this virus.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) maintains a listexternal icon of all animals with confirmed infections with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.

Research on animals and COVID-19

Research on SARS-Cov-2 in animals is limited, but studies are underway to learn more about how this virus can affect different animals.

Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.

A number of studies have investigated non-human primates as models for human infection. Rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, Grivets, and common marmosets can become infected SARS-CoV-2 and become sick in a laboratory setting.

Mice, pigs, chickens, and ducks do not seem to become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.

Data from one study suggest some dogs can get infected but might not spread the virus to other dogs as easily compared to cats and ferrets, which can easily spread the virus to other animals of the same species

These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people. More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.

What to do if you own pets

Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from a possible infection.

Because there is a risk that people with COVID-19 could spread the virus to animals, CDC recommends that pet owners limit their pet’s interaction with people outside their household.

Keep cats indoors when possible and do not let them roam freely outside.

Walk dogs on a leash at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others.

Avoid public places where a large number of people gather.

Do not put a mask on pets. Masks could harm your pet.

There is no evidence that the virus can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.

Protect pets if you are sick

If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed by a test), you should restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would with people. Until we know more about this virus, people sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals.

When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.

Avoid contact with your pet including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, sharing food, and sleeping in the same bed.

If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a mask and wash your hands before and after you interact with them.

If you are sick with COVID-19 and your pet becomes sick, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Call your veterinarian and let them know you have been sick with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.

Stay healthy around animals

In the United States, there is no evidence that animals are playing a significant role in the spread of COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals.

Wash your hands after handling animals, their food, waste, or supplies.

Practice good pet hygiene and clean up after pets properly.

Talk to your veterinarian if you have questions about your pet’s health.

Be aware that children 5 years of age and younger, people with weakened immune systems, and older adults are more likely to get sick from germs some animals can carry.

Health Equity Considerations and Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups,"Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put many people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19. The term “racial and ethnic minority groups” includes people of color with a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. But some experiences are common to many people within these groups, and social determinants of health have historically prevented them from having fair opportunities for economic, physical, and emotional health. [1]

There is increasing evidence that some racial and ethnic minority groups are being disproportionately affected by COVID-19. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] Inequities in the social determinants of health, such as poverty and healthcare access, affecting these groups are interrelated and influence a wide range of health and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.[1] To achieve health equity, barriers must be removed so that everyone has a fair opportunity to be as healthy as possible.

Factors that contribute to increased risk

Some of the many inequities in social determinants of health that put racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19 include:

Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination exists in systems meant to protect well-being or health. Examples of such systems include health care, housing, education, criminal justice, and finance. Discrimination, which includes racism, can lead to chronic and toxic stress and shapes social and economic factors that put some people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk for COVID-19.[5], [7], [8], [9]

Healthcare access and utilization : People from some racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be uninsured than non-Hispanic whites. [10] Healthcare access can also be limited for these groups by many other factors, such as lack of transportation, child care, or ability to take time off of work; communication and language barriers; cultural differences between patients and providers; and historical and current discrimination in healthcare systems. [11] Some people from racial and ethnic minority groups may hesitate to seek care because they distrust the government and healthcare systems responsible for inequities in treatment [12] and historical events such as the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the African American Male and sterilization without people’s permission. [13], [14], [15], [16]

Occupation : People from some racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately represented in essential work settings such as healthcare facilities, farms, factories, grocery stores, and public transportation. [17] Some people who work in these settings have more chances to be exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 due to several factors, such as close contact with the public or other workers, not being able to work from home, and not having paid sick days.

Educational, income, and wealth gaps : Inequities in access to high-quality education for some racial and ethnic minority groups can lead to lower high school completion rates and barriers to college entrance. This may limit future job options and lead to lower paying or less stable jobs. [19] People with limited job options likely have less flexibility to leave jobs that may put them at a higher risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. People in these situations often cannot afford to miss work, even if they’re sick, because they do not have enough money saved up for essential items like food and other important living needs.

Housing: Some people from racial and ethnic minority groups live in crowded conditions that make it more challenging to follow prevention strategies. In some cultures, it is common for family members of many generations to live in one household. In addition, growing and disproportionate unemployment rates for some racial and ethnic minority groups during the COVID-19 pandemic[19] may lead to greater risk of eviction and homelessness or sharing of housing.

These factors and others are associated with more COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in areas where racial and ethnic minority groups live, learn, work, play, and worship.[5],[10], [20], [21] They have also contributed to higher rates of some medical conditions that increase one’s risk of severe illness from COVID-19. In addition, community strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19 may cause unintentional harm, such as lost wages, reduced access to services, and increased stress, for some racial and ethnic minority groups. [22]

What We Can Do

The COVID-19 pandemic may change some of the ways we connect and support each other. As individuals and communities respond to COVID-19 recommendations and circumstances (e.g., school closures, workplace closures, social distancing), there are often unintended negative impacts on emotional well-being such as loss of social connectedness and support. Shared faith, family, and cultural bonds are common sources of social support. Finding ways to maintain support and connection, even when physically apart, can empower and encourage individuals and communities to protect themselves, care for those who become sick, keep kids healthy, and better cope with stress.

Community- and faith-based organizations, employers, healthcare systems and providers, public health agencies, policy makers, and others all have a part in helping to promote fair access to health. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, we must work together to ensure that people have resources to maintain and manage their physical and mental health, including easy access to information, affordable testing, and medical and mental health care. We need programs and practices that fit the communities where racial and minority groups live, learn, work, play, and worship.

Caring for People with Disabilities,"What do Direct Service Providers for people with disabilities need to know about COVID-19?

Direct Service Providers (DSPs) include personal care attendants, direct support professionals, paraprofessionals, therapists, and others. They provide a wide variety of home and community-based, health-related services that support people with disabilitiesexternal icon. Services provided may include personal care, activities of daily living, access to health services, and more. DSPs have close and consistent contact with people with disabilities and those providing healthcare support services in day and residential programs for people with disabilities. DSPs are considered to be in the same general risk category as health care personnel. DSPs are essential for the health and well-being of the people they serve. DSPs should be aware of how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads, risk factors, and prevention actions.

Some groups may be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Knowing how COVID-19 spreads can help DSPs protect themselves and others.

Here are commonly asked questions that DSPs have about caring for people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

How can I protect myself and the people I work with?

As a DSP, your risk of exposure will depend on factors including the setting you work in, the number of people you provide services to, and the spread of COVID-19 in your community. Check with your employer for any specific policies and procedures related to COVID-19 and practice everyday prevention actions when working with clients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In addition:

When possible, keep at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and others in the home or community setting.

Wear a mask when you are at work.

Encourage your client to wear a mask. Wearing masks may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues. Masks are not recommended for children under 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance.

If there is potential that you may be splashed or sprayed by bodily fluids during your work, use standard precautions. Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes a facemask, eye protection, disposable gloves, and a gown.

Wash your hands with soap and water: when entering and leaving the home or community setting; when adjusting or putting on or off facemasks; or before putting on and after taking off disposable gloves. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Learn more about proper handwashing.

Wear disposable gloves when touching the client (e.g., dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, toileting, feeding), handling tissues, when changing linens or doing laundry. Safely dispose of gloves after use. As noted above, wash your hands before and after taking off disposable gloves. If gloves are unavailable, wash hands immediately after touching the client or handling their belongings.

Launder work uniforms or clothes after each use with the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.

If you work in the home of an individual with disabilities, also practice these additional prevention actions:

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (e.g., counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, bedside tables), and equipment (e.g., wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, canes, oxygen tanks and tubing, communication boards and other assistive devices).

Help the client plan for possible changes in service due to COVID-19. Plan for what to do if you or other DSPs get sick. Create a contact list of family, friends, neighbors and local service agencies that can provide support. Review with the client: How to monitor for symptoms. When and how to contact their healthcare provider. Many healthcare providers have developed new ways to provide healthcare services, such as using telehealth. Help the client find out how those are arranged and any additional information.



Help make or update care plans or an emergency notebook. Care plans typically include important information about a person’s medical conditions, how to manage those conditions, how to contact healthcare providers, therapists and pharmacy, information on allergies, medications (names, dosages, and administration instructions), preferences (food and other), daily routines and activities. This information may help the client and new DSPs provide consistent care if the usual provider is unavailable.

Plan at least two ways of communicating from home and work that can be used rapidly in an emergency (e.g., landline phone, cell phone, text-messaging, email). Write this information down for both you and the client. Each of you should keep a copy with you.

Plan to have enough household items and groceries for a few weeks, at least a 30-day supply of over the counter and prescription medicines and any medical equipment or supplies that might be needed. Some health plans allow for a 90-day refill on prescription medications. Make a photocopy of prescriptions, as this may help in obtaining medications in an emergency.



If you provide services for a client in a community-based setting, such as a group home or day program,

Follow any employer, facility, and program guidance for additional precautions related to COVID-19.

Encourage the clients you work with to practice everyday prevention actions, if possible, and assist them when needed.

Follow everyday prevention actions if there are no known or suspected cases of COVID-19 in the community-based setting where you work.

CDC has also provided guidance for group homes for people with disabilities. Many of the recommendations for COVID-19 preparation and response described in that guidance document also apply to DSPs.

What if my client or someone they live with has been exposed to COVID-19, has symptoms of COVID-19, or tests positive for COVID-19?

What if I become sick or am exposed to someone who has COVID-19?

Stay home and self-isolate, except to get medical care. Staying at home helps protect the people you work with who may be at greater risk of infection or severe illness from COVID-19. It also helps protect others in the community.

If you develop symptoms such as a fever, cough, difficulty breathing, or new loss of taste or smell or you have been exposed to COVID-19, call your healthcare provider for further guidance.

Notify your employer, the client with disabilities and, if applicable, their guardian as soon as possible so appropriate plans for an alternate DSP can be made. The client should be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms.

Are my clients at increased risk for becoming infected or having severe illness from COVID-19?

People with one of the disability types listed may be at increased risk of becoming infected or having severe illness from COVID-19.

People who have limited mobility and/or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected

People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing

People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness

People who are blind or have low vision who rely on touch or tactile information

People who need alternative communication methods, such as sign language or braille, who may not have access to information

Adults with disabilities are three times more likely than adults without disabilities to have serious underlying medical conditions. They may have an increased risk for serious illness from COVID-19 if they are older adults live in a long-term care facility or have certain underlying medical conditions. Learn more about people who are at higher risk for severe illness.

How can I cope with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Remember to take care of your physical and mental health as you continue to provide important services to people with disabilities. It is important for you to maintain healthy behaviors, manage stress, and seek additional support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are some important steps to take to help you manage and cope with stress:

Take care of your body. Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals. Exercise regularly. Get plenty of sleep. Avoid alcohol and drugs.

Make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade. Try to do some other activities you enjoy.

Caring for People with Developmental and Behavioral Disorders,"People with developmental and behavioral disorders may live in group homes or interact with Direct Service Providers (DSPs). CDC has provided guidance for group homes and DSPs who provide assistance to people with disabilities. Many of the recommendations for COVID-19 preparation and response described in those guidance documents also apply to caregivers and DSPs for people with developmental and behavioral disorders.

Accommodations, modifications, and assistance

Special considerations may be needed for people with developmental and behavioral disorders who have limited mobility, have difficulty accessing information, require close contact with Direct Service Providers, have trouble understanding information, have difficulties with changes in routines, or have other concerns related to their disability. They may need special considerations for communication and preventive actions such as:

Check with organizations that support people with developmental and behavioral disorders for communication tools and other resources related to COVID-19.

Social distancing and isolating may be difficult for them, and they may require reminders or supervision.

Wearing masks may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues. Masks are not recommended for children under 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance.

Covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing and/or coughing (when not wearing a mask), throwing it in the trash, and washing hands afterwards may require assistance or visual and verbal reminders.

Cleaning and disinfecting may affect those with sensory or respiratory issues.

Hand washing or using a hand sanitizer may require assistance or supervision.

Cleaning and disinfecting may require assistance or supervision.

Developmental monitoring and screening of children during COVID-19

Children should continue to have their development monitored and receive recommended developmental screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Developmental monitoring and screening can occur through a healthcare provider’s office, a childcare center, WIC programs, and other early childhood programs. Parents of children 2 months to 5 years of age can monitor their child’s development using CDC’s Free Milestone Tracker app.

If there are developmental concerns for a child under three years old, the child may qualify for their state’s early intervention program. Evaluations for early intervention and early intervention services are still occurring during COVID-19.

If a child is three years or older, the child may qualify for services through their local school system. These services can include pre-school and K-12 special education; therapies such as speech, occupational, and physical therapy; and more. Contact the local school system’s Department of Special Education to see how to access evaluations and services during COVID-19.

Distance learning for college or graduate school students with developmental or behavioral disorders

Encourage students to discuss any necessary accommodations they need for online learning with their school’s disability resource center (DRC). If students have internet access issues or new technology needs, the DRC may be able to loan them equipment. State Vocational Rehabilitation Agenciesexternal icon may also be able to help with accessing technology. Advise students to contact their professors to let them know of any new accommodations that the DRC has approved and find out how to access virtual office hours.

Other services may still be offered such as university counseling centers for telehealth visits and academic counselors to help students plan for summer and fall semesters.

Parents supporting children with distance learning

If you have a child who receives special education services, accommodations or services received in school through their 504 plan or Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) should be continued, as much as possible, while learning at home. Many schools are continuing interventions like speech therapy, small group classes, extended time and more. If your child or family is struggling with the challenges of homeschooling, talk with his or her teachers to find ways to help.

For some families, this may be a good time to reassess a child’s strengths related to learning and identify areas where a child may need more support. See which interventions and strategies are helpful for your child’s learning and which ones are not. Take notes and bring your observations and questions to the next reassessment or IEP meeting.

Children with learning and developmental differences may also experience stress and anxiety. The changes related to COVID-19 can add to their stress. Some children may have more difficulty expressing their emotions and some may need assistance in developing and using coping skills. Learn more about helping children cope with emergencies.

Find what works for your family and set your own goals: eating meals together, exercising, and staying connected with others while working on academic goals.

Guidance for Child Care Programs that Remain Open,"Summary of recent changes: Includes additional options for screening children upon arrival to ensure that children who have a fever or other signs of illness are not admitted to the facility.

The additional options may be useful when personal protective equipment (PPE) is in short supply.

These additional considerations are intended to provide guidance for a range of child care programs, including: Family child care programs, also known as home-based child care

Pre-K (Pre-kindergarten) programs at private and public schools

Head Start and Early Head Start programs

Private child care centers

Temporary child care centers operated by municipalities for the children of essential service providers, such as first responders, healthcare workers, transit workers, and other industries where a parent cannot stay home

Child care centers that partner with healthcare facilities to support healthcare workers who need child care This information is intended for child care programs that remain open and should be used in conjunction with CDC’s guidance for administrators of child care programs and K-12 schools. This guidance does not supersede applicable federal, state, and local laws and policies for child care programs.

General Preparedness and Planning

As you think about how your facility will deal with the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is important to work with your local health officials, school districts, child care licensing boards/bodies, child care accreditation bodies, health consultants, and other community partners to determine the most appropriate plan and action. This document is meant to help administrators create emergency operations plans and tailor them to your community’s level of transmission.

No matter the level of transmission in a community, every child care program should have a plan in place to protect staff, children, and their families from the spread of COVID-19. See CDC’s guidance for more details.

Prevent the Spread of COVID-19

Plan ahead to ensure adequate supplies to support hand hygiene behaviors and routine cleaning of objects and surfaces. If you have difficulty in obtaining these supplies, please contact your local Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) Agency to learn more about service organizations in your community who may have additional resources. Your local CCR&R Agency can be found under “Resourcesexternal icon” at Child Care Aware of America.

Encourage staff to take everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory illness.

Wash hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

Remember to supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

Cover cough and sneezes.

Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when you have to go out in public.

Masks should NOT be put on babies and children under age two because of the danger of suffocation.

Require sick children and staff to stay home.

Communicate to parents the importance of keeping children home when they are sick.

Communicate to staff the importance of being vigilant for symptoms and staying in touch with facility management if or when they start to feel sick.

Establish procedures to ensure children and staff who come to the child care center sick or become sick while at your facility are sent home as soon as possible.

Keep sick children and staff separate from well children and staff until they can be sent home.

Sick staff members should not return to work until they have met the criteria to discontinue home isolation.

Have a plan if someone is or becomes sick.

Plan to have an isolation room or area (such as a cot in a corner of the classroom) that can be used to isolate a sick child. Additional information about isolation in related settings can be found here: isolation at home and isolation in healthcare settings.

Be ready to follow CDC guidance on how to disinfect your building or facility if someone is sick.

If a sick child has been isolated in your facility, clean and disinfect surfaces in your isolation room or area after the sick child has gone home.

If COVID-19 is confirmed in a child or staff member: Close off areas used by the person who is sick. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the areas. Wait up to 24 hours or as long as possible before you clean or disinfect to allow respiratory droplets to settle before cleaning and disinfecting. Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as offices, bathrooms, and common areas. If more than 7 days have passed since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routine cleaning and disinfection.



Monitor and Plan for Absenteeism Among Your Staff

Develop plans to cover classes in the event of increased staff absences. Coordinate with other local child care programs and reach out to substitutes to determine their anticipated availability if regular staff members need to stay home if they or their family members are sick.

Recommend that people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions) consult with their medical provider to assess their risk and to determine if they should stay home if there is an outbreak in their community.

Review plans for implementing social distancing strategies

Social distancing focuses on remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance from others when possible. Detailed guidance for implementing social distancing strategies in child care centers and schools is found here: Social Distancing Strategies

Assess Group Gatherings and Events

Follow current guidance about gatherings and events.

Plan to limit nonessential visitors and postpone or cancel use of classroom volunteers.

If Your Child Care Program Remains Open

Child care programs that remain open during the COVID-19 pandemic should address these additional considerations:

Some schools, child care programs, and service organizations are supporting their communities by providing temporary or emergency child care services for the children of essential service providers such as first responders, healthcare workers, transit or food retail workers, and persons who do not have paid leave, cannot work from home, or do not have a family caregiver at home. If you re-purpose your school or service facility as an emergency or temporary child care center, please follow CDC guidance for administrators of child care programs and K-12 schools.

Be sure to follow state and local child care licensing policies and regulations external icon . Specifically, all facilities should continue to adhere to their state and local licensing policies unless otherwise notified by their local health department.

. Specifically, all facilities should continue to adhere to their state and local licensing policies unless otherwise notified by their local health department. Guidance may also be provided by the department of education and/or health department in your state, city, or locality.

Social Distancing Strategies

Work with your local health officials to determine a set of strategies appropriate for your community’s situation. Continue using preparedness strategies and consider the following social distancing strategies:

If possible, child care classes should include the same group each day, and the same child care providers should remain with the same group each day. If your child care program remains open, consider creating a separate classroom or group for the children of healthcare workers and other first responders. If your program is unable to create a separate classroom, consider serving only the children of healthcare workers and first responders.

Cancel or postpone special events such as festivals, holiday events, and special performances.

Consider whether to alter or halt daily group activities that may promote transmission. Keep each group of children in a separate room. Limit the mixing of children, such as staggering playground times and keeping groups separate for special activities such as art, music, and exercising. If possible, at nap time, ensure that children’s naptime mats (or cribs) are spaced out as much as possible, ideally 6 feet apart. Consider placing children head to toe in order to further reduce the potential for viral spread.

Consider staggering arrival and drop off times and/or have child care providers come outside the facility to pick up the children as they arrive. Your plan for curb side drop off and pick up should limit direct contact between parents and staff members and adhere to social distancing recommendations.

If possible, arrange for administrative staff to telework from their homes.

Parent Drop-Off and Pick-Up

Hand hygiene stations should be set up at the entrance of the facility, so that children can clean their hands before they enter. If a sink with soap and water is not available, provide hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol next to parent sign-in sheets. Keep hand sanitizer out of children’s reach and supervise use. If possible, place sign-in stations outside, and provide sanitary wipes for cleaning pens between each use.

Consider staggering arrival and drop off times and plan to limit direct contact with parents as much as possible. Have child care providers greet children outside as they arrive. Designate a parent to be the drop off/pick up volunteer to walk all children to their classroom, and at the end of the day, walk all children back to their cars. Infants could be transported in their car seats. Store car seat out of children’s reach.

Ideally, the same parent or designated person should drop off and pick up the child every day. If possible, older people such as grandparents or those with serious underlying medical conditions should not pick up children, because they are more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Screen Children Upon Arrival (if possible)

Persons who have a fever of 100.40 (38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the facility. Encourage parents to be on the alert for signs of illness in their children and to keep them home when they are sick. Screen children upon arrival, if possible.

There are several methods that facilities can use to protect their workers while conducting temperature screenings. The most protective methods incorporate social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others) or physical barriers to eliminate or minimize exposures due to close contact to a child who has symptoms during screening.

Examples of Screening Methods

Reliance on Social Distancing (example 1)

Ask parents/guardians to take their child’s temperature either before coming to the facility or upon arrival at the facility. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the parent/guardian and child.

Ask the parent/guardian to confirm that the child does not have fever, shortness of breath or cough.

Make a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness.

You do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if you can maintain a distance of 6 feet.

Reliance on Barrier/Partition Controls (example 2)

Stand behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition that can serve to protect the staff member’s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced if the child being screened sneezes, coughs, or talks.

Make a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness.

Conduct temperature screening (follow steps below) Perform hand hygiene Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Put on disposable gloves.

Check the child’s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window.

Make sure your face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening.

If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals , ensure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each child and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check.

, ensure that you use a and that the in between each check. If you use disposable or non-contact (temporal) thermometers and you did not have physical contact with the child, you do not need to change gloves before the next check.

If you use non-contact thermometers, clean them with an alcohol wipe (or isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab) between each client. You can reuse the same wipe as long as it remains wet.

Reliance on Personal Protective Equipment (example 3)

If social distancing or barrier/partition controls cannot be implemented during screening, personal protective equipment (PPE) can be used when within 6 feet of a child. However, reliance on PPE alone is a less effective control and more difficult to implement, given PPE shortages and training requirements.

Upon arrival, wash your hands and put on a facemask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves. A gown could be considered if extensive contact with a child is anticipated.

Make a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness, and confirm that the child is not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.

Take the child’s temperature. If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals , ensure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each child and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If you use disposable or non-contact (temporal) thermometers and did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If you use non-contact thermometers, clean them with an alcohol wipe (or isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab) between each client. You can reuse the same wipe as long as it remains wet.

After each screening, remove and discard PPE, and wash hands.

Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol or wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

If hands are visibly soiled, soap and water should be used before using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

If your staff does not have experience in using PPE: Check to see if your facility has guidance on how to don and doff PPE. The procedure to don and doff should be tailored to the specific type of PPE that you have available at your facility. If your facility does not have specific guidance, the CDC has recommended sequences for donning and doffing PPE pdf icon .



Clean and Disinfect

Caring for Our Childrenexternal icon (CFOC) provides national standards for cleaning, sanitizing and disinfection of educational facilities for children. Toys that can be put in the mouth should be cleaned and sanitized (see below). Other hard surfaces, including diaper changing stations, door knobs, and floors can be disinfected.

Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts:

Facilities should develop a schedule for cleaning and disinfecting. An example can be found here pdf icon external icon .

. Routinely clean, sanitize, and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially toys and games. This may also include cleaning objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily such as doorknobs, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops, nap pads, toilet training potties, desks, chairs, cubbies, and playground structures. Use the cleaners typically used at your facility. Guidance is available for the selection of appropriate sanitizers or disinfectants pdf icon external icon for child care settings.

for child care settings. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label. For disinfection, most common EPA-registered, fragrance-free household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here external icon . If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for concentration, application method, and contact time for all cleaning and disinfection products.

. If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for concentration, application method, and contact time for all cleaning and disinfection products. If possible, provide EPA-registered disposable wipes to child care providers and other staff members so that commonly used surfaces such as keyboards, desks, and remote controls can be wiped down before use. If wipes are not available, please refer to CDC’s guidance on disinfection for community settings.

All cleaning materials should be kept secure and out of reach of children.

Cleaning products should not be used near children, and staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent children from inhaling toxic fumes.

Clean and Sanitize Toys

Tips for cleaning toys

Toys that cannot be cleaned and sanitized should not be used.

Toys that children have placed in their mouths or that are otherwise contaminated by body secretions or excretions should be set aside until they are cleaned by hand by a person wearing gloves. Clean with water and detergent, rinse, sanitize with an EPA-registered disinfectant, rinse again, and air-dry. You may also clean in a mechanical dishwasher. Be mindful of items more likely to be placed in a child’s mouth, like play food, dishes, and utensils.

Machine washable cloth toys should be used by one individual at a time or should not be used at all. These toys should be laundered before being used by another child.

Do not share toys with other groups of infants or toddlers, unless they are washed and sanitized before being moved from one group to the other.

Set aside toys that need to be cleaned. Place in a dish pan with soapy water or put in a separate container marked for “soiled toys.” Keep dish pan and water out of reach from children to prevent risk of drowning. Washing with soapy water is the ideal method for cleaning. Try to have enough toys so that the toys can be rotated through cleanings.

Children’s books, like other paper-based materials such as mail or envelopes, are not considered a high risk for transmission and do not need additional cleaning or disinfection procedures.

Clean and Disinfect Bedding

Use bedding (sheets, pillows, blankets, sleeping bags) that can be washed. Keep each child’s bedding separate, and consider storing in individually labeled bins, cubbies, or bags. Cots and mats should be labeled for each child. Bedding that touches a child’s skin should be cleaned weekly or before use by another child.

Caring for Infants and Toddlers

Diapering

When diaperingexternal icon a child, wash your hands and wash the child’s hands before you begin, and wear gloves. Follow safe diaper changing procedures. Procedures should be posted in all diaper changing areas. Steps include:

Prepare (includes putting on gloves)

Clean the child

Remove trash (soiled diaper and wipes)

Replace diaper

Wash child’s hands

Clean up diapering station

Wash hands

After diapering, wash your hands (even if you were wearing gloves) and disinfect the diapering area with a fragrance-free bleach that is EPA-registered as a sanitizing or disinfecting solution. If other products are used for sanitizing or disinfecting, they should also be fragrance-free and EPA-registered. If the surface is dirty, it should be cleaned with detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

If reusable cloth diapers are used, they should not be rinsed or cleaned in the facility. The soiled cloth diaper and its contents (without emptying or rinsing) should be placed in a plastic bag or into a plastic-lined, hands-free covered diaper pail to give to parents/guardians or laundry service.

Washing, Feeding, or Holding a Child

It is important to comfort crying, sad, and/or anxious infants and toddlers, and they often need to be held. To the extent possible, when washing, feeding, or holding very young children: Child care providers can protect themselves by wearing an over-large button-down, long sleeved shirt and by wearing long hair up off the collar in a ponytail or other updo.

Child care providers should wash their hands, neck, and anywhere touched by a child’s secretions.

Child care providers should change the child’s clothes if secretions are on the child’s clothes. They should change the button-down shirt, if there are secretions on it, and wash their hands again.

Contaminated clothes should be placed in a plastic bag or washed in a washing machine.

Infants, toddlers, and their providers should have multiple changes of clothes on hand in the child care center or home-based child care.

Child care providers should wash their hands before and after handling infant bottles prepared at home or prepared in the facility. Bottles, bottle caps, nipples, and other equipment used for bottle-feeding should be thoroughly cleaned after each use by washing in a dishwasher or by washing with a bottlebrush, soap, and water.

School nurses in schools that have been re-purposed as emergency or temporary child care centers should use Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for patients with confirmed or possible COVID-19. See: What Healthcare Personnel Should Know about Caring for Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19 Infection.

Healthy Hand Hygiene Behavior

All children, staff, and volunteers should engage in hand hygiene at the following times: Arrival to the facility and after breaks Before and after preparing food or drinks Before and after eating or handling food, or feeding children Before and after administering medication or medical ointment Before and after diapering After using the toilet or helping a child use the bathroom After coming in contact with bodily fluid After handling animals or cleaning up animal waste After playing outdoors or in sand After handling garbage

Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are not visibly dirty, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol can be used if soap and water are not readily available.

Supervise children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent ingestion.

Assist children with handwashing, including infants who cannot wash hands alone. After assisting children with handwashing, staff should also wash their hands.

Place posters describing handwashing steps near sinks. Developmentally appropriate posters in multiple languages are available from CDC.

Food Preparation and Meal Service

If a cafeteria or group dining room is typically used, serve meals in classrooms instead. If meals are typically served family-style, plate each child’s meal to serve it so that multiple children are not using the same serving utensils.

Food preparation should not be done by the same staff who diaper children.

Sinks used for food preparation should not be used for any other purposes.

Caregivers should ensure children wash hands prior to and immediately after eating.

Caregivers should wash their hands before preparing food and after helping children to eat.

Facilities should follow all other applicable federal, state, and local regulations and guidanceexternal icon related to safe preparation of food.

Vulnerable/High Risk Groups

Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. To protect those at higher risk, it’s important that everyone practices healthy hygiene behaviors.

If you have staff members or teachers age 65 or older, or with serious underlying health conditions, encourage them to talk to their healthcare provider to assess their risk and to determine if they should stay home.

Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that many children have mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. If you have children with underlying health conditions, talk to their parents about their risk. Follow children’s care plans for underlying health conditions such as an asthma action plan.

Other Resources

CDC’s website contains a variety of resources for child care programs and K-12 schools, including detailed guidance, considerations for closures, and frequently asked questions for administrators, teachers, and parents. Together, these resources provide additional information on:

What to do if a child or staff member at your facility becomes sick.

Closures of child care programs.

The resources emphasize that any decision about temporary closures of child care programs or cancellation of related events should be made in coordination with your federal, state, and local educational officials as well as state and local health officials. Child care programs are not expected to make decisions about closures on their own. The resources also address steps to ensure continuity of meal programs and other essential services if your facility is closed; additional government resources related to meals and snacks can be found here: https://www.fns.usda.gov/cacfpexternal icon

Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers,"This guidance is intended to inform pediatric healthcare providers of up-to-date information about children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and about caring for children during the pandemic. Children are defined as age 1 month to 18 years for the purpose of this document. For healthcare providers caring for neonates (≤28 days old) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, including those born to a mother with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, please refer to CDC guidance for evaluating and managing neonates at risk for COVID-19.

Infections Among Children

Incidence of COVID-19 in Children

In the United States and globally, fewer cases of COVID-19 have been reported in children (age 0-17 years) compared with adults.1,2 While children comprise 22% of the US population,3 recent data show that 7.3% of all cases of COVID-19 in the United States reported to CDC were among children (as of August 3rd, 2020).4 The number and rate of cases in children in the United States have been steadily increasing from March to July 2020. The true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not known due to lack of widespread testing and the prioritization of testing for adults and those with severe illness. Hospitalization rates in children are significantly lower than hospitalization rates in adults with COVID-19, suggesting that children may have less severe illness from COVID-19 compared to adults.5, 6 Visit CDC’s Cases, Data, and Surveillance page for current CDC data.

Infections and Transmission Among Children

It is unclear whether children are as susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 compared with adults and whether they can transmit the virus as effectively as adults. Recent evidence suggests that children likely have the same or higher viral loads in their nasopharynx compared with adults7 and that children can spread the virus effectively in households and camp settings.8,9

Due to community mitigation measures and school closures, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to and among children may have been reduced in the United States during the pandemic in the spring and early summer of 2020. This may explain the low incidence in children compared with adults. Comparing trends in pediatric infections before and after the return to in-person school and other activities may provide additional understanding about infections in children.

Symptoms and Severity of COVID-19 in Children

Clinical Presentation

The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be about the same for children as in adults, at 2-14 days with an average of 6 days.10

Signs or symptoms of COVID-19 in children include:

Fever

Fatigue

Headache

Myalgia

Cough

Nasal congestion or rhinorrhea

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Abdominal pain

Diarrhea

Nausea or vomiting

Poor appetite or poor feeding

Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have many of these non-specific symptoms, may only have a few (such as only upper respiratory symptoms or only gastrointestinal symptoms), or may be asymptomatic. The most common symptoms in children are cough and/or fever.11-15 A recent systematic review estimated that 16% of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic,16 but evidence suggests that as many as 45% of pediatric infections are asymptomatic.17 The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to other infections and noninfectious processes, including influenza, streptococcal pharyngitis, and allergic rhinitis. The lack of specificity of signs or symptoms and the significant proportion of asymptomatic infections make symptom-based screening for identification of SARS-CoV-2 in children particularly challenging.17

Severity of Illness in Children

While children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely to develop severe illness compared with adults, children are still at risk of developing severe illness and complications from COVID-19. Recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among children is low (8.0 per 100,000 population) compared with that in adults (164.5 per 100,000 population), but hospitalization rates in children are increasing. 5 While children have lower rates of mechanical ventilation and death than adults, 1 in 3 children hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States were admitted to the intensive care unit, which is the same in adults.5

Current evidence suggests that children with certain underlying medical conditions and infants (age <1 year) might be at increased risk for severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection.10,11,14 Of the children who have developed severe illness from COVID-19, most have had underlying medical conditions. 5

There is limited evidence about which underlying medical conditions in children might increase the risk for severe illness. Current evidence suggests that children with medical complexity, with genetic, neurologic, metabolic conditions, or with congenital heart disease might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Similar to adults, children with obesity, diabetes, asthma and chronic lung disease, sickle cell disease, or immunosuppression might also be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

While healthcare providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection in these populations and monitor the progression of illness closely, it appears that most infants 18 and children with certain underlying conditions such as cancer 19 who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not usually develop severe illness.

and children with certain underlying conditions such as cancer who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not usually develop severe illness. Hospitalization rates in the United States are higher among Hispanic/Latino children and black, non-Hispanic children and non-Hispanic black children compared with white children, which may be related to the higher rates of obesity and other underlying conditions among these populations.5

Similar to adults, children with severe COVID-19 may develop respiratory failure, myocarditis, shock, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, and multi-organ system failure. Some children with COVID-19 have developed other serious problems like intussusception or diabetic ketoacidosis.10,14, 20,21 Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are also at risk for developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).22 For the case definition, recommended evaluation, and current data on MIS-C cases in the United States, visit MIS-C Information for Healthcare Providers.

Testing and Recommendations for Isolation

Viral tests (nucleic acid or antigen) are recommended to diagnose acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Testing strategies, including clinical criteria for considering testing and recommended specimen type, are the same for children and adults. CDC’s guidance for the evaluation and management of neonates at risk for COVID-19 details specific testing considerations for newborns.

For more information on CDC’s recommendations for isolation, which apply to children and adults, visit: discontinuing precautions and disposition of patients with COVID-19 in healthcare settings and discontinuation of home isolation for people not in healthcare settings.

Testing, Isolation, and Quarantine for School-Aged Children

As children return to school and other in-person activities, pediatric healthcare providers should be prepared to answer questions from families about testing and when it is safe to return to school or be with people outside the household. Review CDC’s information for school administrators on symptom screening and testing for children in school as well as CDC’s Community Mitigation framework.

School-aged children should be prioritized for viral testing if they have:

Signs or symptoms of COVID-19 and close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes or more) with a person with laboratory confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection or increased likelihood for exposure (which includes living in or traveling to a community with substantial transmission as defined by the local public health department and described in CDC’s Community Mitigation framework)

No symptoms but have had close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes or more) with a person with laboratory confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Children with symptoms of an infectious disease should not attend school, but the length of time the child should stay home depends on the most likely etiology of illness (COVID-19 or not). Return to school policies for children with COVID-19 should be based on CDC’s recommendation for discontinuation of home isolation. A negative test or doctor’s note should not be required for return to school upon completion of the 10 days of isolation with improvement of symptoms.

If the child has symptoms of COVID-19, but the child has not had close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes or more) with a person with laboratory confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection and the child does not have an increased likelihood for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (which includes living in or traveling to a community with substantial transmission), he or she should be evaluated for other disease processes.​ If the child is determined to likely not have COVID-19 by a healthcare provider, he/she should be allowed to return to school according to existing school policies for non-COVID illnesses. Examples of non-COVID return to school policies include resolution of fever without antipyretics for 24 hours for non-COVID viral illnesses or after initiation of antibiotics for bacterial illnesses.

have COVID-19 by a healthcare provider, he/she should be allowed to return to school according to existing school policies for non-COVID illnesses. Examples of non-COVID return to school policies include resolution of fever without antipyretics for 24 hours for non-COVID viral illnesses or after initiation of antibiotics for bacterial illnesses. If the child has symptoms of COVID-19 and has increased likelihood for exposure (which includes living in or traveling to a community with substantial transmission), he or she should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, if possible. If the test result is negative, the child should be allowed to return to school once their symptoms of illness have improved consistent with non-COVID return to school policies. If testing cannot be obtained, the child should be considered a presumed case of COVID-19 and should isolate according to CDC’s recommendations for discontinuation of home isolation.

If the child has had close contact to someone with SARS-CoV-2, he or she should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 but must remain in quarantine for the 14-day incubation period even if results are negative, in accordance with CDC’s Quarantine If You Might Be Sick.

Laboratory and Radiographic Findings of COVID-19

Typical laboratory findings in children with COVID-19 include mild abnormalities in white blood cell count (either increased or decreased lymphocyte counts), mildly elevated inflammatory markers (including procalcitonin), and mildly elevated liver enzymes.23 Radiologic findings in children with COVID-19 include unilateral or bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph or CT, ground-glass opacities on CT, and consolidation with surrounding Halo sign on CT.23,24 CT should be used sparingly and only for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications. For more information, see recommendations from the American College of Radiologyexternal icon.

Management of COVID-19 in Children

Pediatric healthcare providers should consider the child’s clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, underlying medical conditions, and the ability for caregivers to care for the child at home when deciding whether the child may need inpatient care for COVID-19. For more information, visit Guidance for home care of people not requiring hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Provide parents resources on emergency warning signs for COVID-19 and caring for someone at home.

Currently, there are no specific drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of COVID-19. Treatment of COVID-19 remains largely supportive and includes prevention and management of complications. Remdesivirexternal icon, which has shown benefits in clinical trials in adults, is currently available through Emergency Use Authorization or compassionate use programs for children. The safety and effectiveness of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been evaluated in children. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that dexamethasoneexternal icon may be beneficial in pediatric patients with COVID-19 respiratory disease who are on mechanical ventilation. For more information, review considerations for childrenexternal icon in NIH’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines.25

For information on evaluation and management of MIS-C, visit MIS-C Information for Healthcare Providers.

It is important to remember that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 can present with other serious conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis or intussusception, and a broad differential must be maintained in evaluating ill children during the COVID-19 pandemic.10,14,20,21,26-29 Standard evaluation and management of co-occurring conditions should be maintained for a child infected with SARS-CoV-2, with additional infection control measures. Pediatric providers should have an appropriate suspicion for COVID-19, but also to continue to consider and test for other diagnoses, such as community acquired pneumoniaexternal icon and influenza (see CDC’s Flu Information for Healthcare Professionals for more information).

CDC has specific guidance for inpatient obstetric healthcare settings and the evaluation and management of neonates at risk for COVID-19. Additionally, several other organizations have published guidelines related to the treatment and management of adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19:

Immunizations and Well-Child Care

Community mitigation measures such as shelter-in-place orders resulted in declines in outpatient pediatric visits and fewer vaccine doses administered during the early COVID-19 pandemic,30 leaving children at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Healthcare providers should work with families to keep children up to date with all recommended vaccinations, especially with influenza vaccinations for the 2020-2021 influenza season. For more information on influenza, visit CDC’s Influenza page. For more information on immunization services and vaccination recommendations during the pandemic, visit Vaccination Guidance.

Healthcare providers should identify children who have missed well-child visits and/or recommended vaccinations and contact them to schedule in-person appointments, with prioritization of infants, children age < 24 months and school-aged children. Developmental surveillance and early childhood screenings, including developmental and autism screening, should continue along with referrals for early intervention services and further evaluation if concerns are identified.

All newborns should be seen by a pediatric healthcare provider shortly after hospital discharge (three to five days of age). Ideally, newborn visits should be done in-person, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, to evaluate feeding and weight gain, check for dehydration and jaundice, ensure all components of newborn screening were completed with appropriate confirmatory testing and follow-up, and evaluate maternal well-being. All healthcare facilities should ensure infection prevention and control policies are in place to minimize chance of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among providers, patients, and families. For specific recommendations by healthcare facility type and level of community transmission, review Infection Control Guidance for Healthcare Professionals. CDC has additional trainings and information about potential exposures in the workplace for healthcare providers.

Pediatric healthcare providers should incorporate education on everyday infection prevention measures, such as the importance of proper hand hygiene, social distancing, and wearing masks when in public, as well as information on stress and coping during the pandemic in their regular anticipatory guidance with children and their families. Pediatric healthcare providers should educate patients and families about infection prevention policies that exist in clinics, emergency departments, hospitals, and clinics. Remind people to seek emergency care immediately, if indicated, as delaying care may cause harm.

Primary care practices should continue to use infection prevention strategies including:

Scheduling sick visits and well-child visits during different times of the day

Reducing crowding in waiting rooms, by asking patients to remain outside (e.g., stay in their vehicles, if applicable) until they are called into the facility for their appointment, or setting up triage booths to screen patients safely

Considering telemedicine for visits that do not involve vaccination or do not require an in-person physical exam. For more information, visit Using Telehealth Services

What We Can Do,"Community- and faith-based organizations, employers, healthcare systems and providers, public health agencies, policy makers, and others all have a part in helping to promote fair access to health. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, we must work together to ensure that people have resources to maintain and manage their physical and mental health, including easy access to information, affordable testing, and medical care. We need programs and practices that fit the communities where people live, learn, work, play, and worship.

Working Together

The COVID-19 pandemic may change some of the ways we connect and support each other. As individuals and communities respond to COVID-19 recommendations and circumstances (e.g., school closings, workplace closures, social distancing), there are often unintended challenges for important aspects of emotional well-being such as social connectedness and social support. Shared faith, family, and cultural bonds are common sources of social support. Finding ways to maintain support and connection, even when physically apart, can empower and encourage individuals and communities to protect themselves, care for those who become sick, keep kids healthy, and better cope with stress.

Reduce health disparities. Use data-driven approaches. Foster meaningful engagement with community institutions and diverse leaders. Lead culturally responsive outreach. Reduce stigma, including stigma associated with race and ethnicity.

Vision

All people have the opportunity to attain the highest level of health possible.

Charge

To reduce the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 among populations at increased risk for infection, severe illness, and death.

To broadly address health disparities and inequities related to COVID-19 with a holistic, all-of-response approach.

To develop a strategic plan to help us realize these goals.

Overview

Achieving health equity requires valuing everyone equally with focused and ongoing efforts to address avoidable inequities, historical and contemporary injustices, and the elimination of health and healthcare disparities. The population health impact of COVID-19 has exposed longstanding inequities that have systematically undermined the physical, social, economic, and emotional health of racial and ethnic minority populations and other population groups that are bearing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19.

Persistent health disparities combined with historic housing patterns, work circumstances, and other factors have put members of some racial and ethnic minority populations at higher risk for COVID-19 infection, severe illness, and death. As we continue to learn more about the impact of COVID-19 on the health of different populations, immediate action is critical to reduce growing COVID-19 disparities among the populations known to be at disproportionate risk.

CDC’s COVID-19 Response Health Equity Strategy broadly seeks to improve the health outcomes of populations disproportionately affected by focusing on four priorities:

Expanding the evidence base. Expanding programs and practices for testing, contact tracing, isolation, healthcare, and recovery from the impact of unintended negative consequences of mitigation strategies in order to reach populations that have been put at increased risk. Examples of potential unintended negative consequences include loss of health insurance; food, housing, and income insecurity; mental health concerns; substance use; and violence resulting from factors like social isolation, financial stress, and anxiety. Expanding program and practice activities to support essential and frontline workers to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Examples of essential and frontline workers include healthcare, food industry, and

correctional facility workers. Expanding an inclusive workforce equipped to assess and address the needs of an increasingly diverse U.S. population.

Populations and Place-Based Focus

Racial and ethnic minority populations

People living in rural or frontier areas

People experiencing homelessness

Essential and frontline workers

People with disabilities

People with substance use disorders

People who are justice-involved (incarcerated persons)

Non-U.S.-born persons

Intended Outcomes

Reduced COVID-19-related health disparities.

Increased testing, contact tracing, isolation options, and preventive care and disease management in populations at increased risk for COVID-19.

Ensured equity in nationwide distribution and administration of future COVID-19 vaccines.

Implemented evidence-based policies, systems, and environmental strategies to mitigate social and health inequities related to COVID-19.

Reduced COVID-19-associated stigma and implicit bias.

Expanded cultural responsiveness and application of health equity principles among an increasingly diverse COVID-19 responder workforce.

Time Period of Strategy

The Health Equity Strategy is focused on immediate actions that can be taken to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and tracks intended outcomes.",##########,
Community Mitigation Framework,"Background

This document describes the goals, guiding principles, and strategies for community mitigation to reduce or prevent local COVID-19 transmission. Community mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of a new virus with pandemic potential. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus. Community mitigation actions are especially important before a vaccine or therapeutic drug becomes widely available.

Because COVID-19 is highly transmissible and can be spread by people who do not know they have the disease, risk of transmission within a community can be difficult to determine. Until broad-scale testing is widely implemented or we have a more comprehensive and precise measure of disease burden, states and communities should assume some community transmission or spread is occurring.

Individuals need to follow healthy hygiene practices, stay at home when sick, practice physical distancing to lower the risk of disease spread, and use a cloth face covering (with some exceptions) in community settings when physical distancing cannot be maintained. These universal precautions are appropriate regardless of the extent of mitigation needed.

Protecting the public’s health is paramount. As communities work to reduce the spread of COVID-19, they are also addressing the economic, social, and secondary health consequences of the disease. State, local, tribal, and territorial officials are best positioned to determine the level of mitigation required. Mitigation strategies should be feasible, practical, and acceptable; they should be tailored to the needs of each community and implemented in a manner that minimizes both morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and does not create or exacerbate any health disparities.

The information that follows provides a framework for states and localities as they consider which actions to take to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. Selection and implementation of these actions should be guided by the extent of disease transmission (Table 1). Demographic and other community characteristics, as well public health and healthcare system capacity, will also drive decisionmaking on mitigation (Table 2). Finally, a set of possible cross-cutting mitigation strategies for communities to consider is outlined (Table 3). More detailed and updated setting or sector specific mitigation strategies can be found here.

Goals

The goal of community mitigation in areas with local COVID-19 transmission is to slow its spread and to protect all individuals, especially those at increased risk for severe illness, while minimizing the negative impacts of these strategies. These strategies are used to minimize morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in societal sectors such as schools, workplaces, and healthcare organizations.

Implementation is based on:

Emphasizing individual responsibility for implementing recommended personal-level actions

Empowering businesses, schools, and other settings to implement appropriate actions

Prioritizing settings that provide critical infrastructure services

Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible and ensuring access to health care and other essential services.

Guiding principles",##########,
Interim Recommendations for US Community Facilities with Suspected,"Background

There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is currently known about the virus and about similar coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, but disease transmission via infectious aerosols is currently uncertain. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through objects and surfaces, like doorknobs, countertops, keyboards, toys, etc. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in community settings.

It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air.

Purpose

This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of rooms or areas occupied by those with suspected or with confirmed COVID-19. It is aimed at limiting the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in key environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.

These guidelines are focused on community, non-healthcare facilities such as schools, institutions of higher education, offices, daycare centers, businesses, and community centers that do, and do not, house persons overnight. These guidelines are not meant for cleaning staff in healthcare facilities or repatriation sites, households, or for others for whom specific guidance already exists.

Definitions

Community facilities such as schools, daycare centers, and businesses comprise most non-healthcare settings that are visited by the general public outside of a household.

Cleaning refers to the removal of dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs. But by removing the germs, it decreases their number and therefore any risk of spreading infection.

Disinfecting works by using chemicals, for example EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. But killing germs remaining on a surface after cleaning further reduces any risk of spreading infection.

Cleaning and Disinfection After Persons Suspected/Confirmed to Have COVID-19 Have Been in the Facility

Timing and location of cleaning and disinfection of surfaces

At a school, daycare center, office, or other facility that does not house people overnight:

Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment (like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines) used by the ill persons , focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces .

At a facility that does house people overnight : Follow Interim Guidance for US Institutions of Higher Education on working with state and local health officials to isolate ill persons and provide temporary housing as needed. Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection. In areas where ill persons are being housed in isolation, follow Interim Guidance for Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection for U.S. Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019. This includes focusing on cleaning and disinfecting common areas where staff/others providing services may come into contact with ill persons but reducing cleaning and disinfection of bedrooms/bathrooms used by ill persons to as-needed. In areas where ill persons have visited or used, continue routine cleaning and disinfection as in this guidance.

: If it has been more than 7 days since the person with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.

How to Clean and Disinfect

Hard (non-porous) surfaces

Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.

If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

Always read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use. Wear skin protection and consider eye protection for potential splash hazards

Ensure adequate ventilation

Use no more than the amount recommended on the label

Use water at room temperature for dilution (unless stated otherwise on the label)

Avoid mixing chemical products

Label diluted cleaning solutions

Store and use chemicals out of the reach of children and pets You should never eat, drink, breathe or inject these products into your body or apply directly to your skin as they can cause serious harm. Do not wipe or bathe pets with these products or any other products that are not approved for animal use. See EPA’s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Useexternal icon. Special considerations should be made for people with asthma and they should not be present when cleaning and disinfecting is happening as this can trigger asthma exacerbations. Learn more about reducing asthma triggers.

Disinfect with a household disinfectant on List N: Disinfectants for use against SARs-CoV-2 external icon , the virus that causes COVID 19. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Read the product label for the correct concentration to use, application method, and contact time.

Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted: Use bleach containing 5.25%–8.25% sodium hypochlorite. Do not use a bleach product if the percentage is not in this range or is not specified. Follow the manufacturer’s application instructions for the surface, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute. Ensure proper ventilation during and after application. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. This can cause fumes that may be very dangerous to breathe in.

Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: 5 tablespoons (1/3 rd cup) of 5.25%–8.25% bleach per gallon of room temperature water or 4 teaspoons of 5.25%–8.25% bleach per quart of room temperature water



Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.

Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.

Cleaning staff and others should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.

Always read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use. Keep hand sanitizers away from fire or flame

For children under six years of age, hand sanitizer should be used with adult supervision

Always store hand sanitizer out of reach of children and pets See FDA’s Tips for Safe Sanitizer Useexternal iconexternal icon and CDC's Hand Sanitizer Use Considerations

Follow normal preventive actions while at work and home, including cleaning hands and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Additional key times to clean hands include: After blowing one’s nose, coughing, or sneezing. After using the restroom. Before eating or preparing food. After contact with animals or pets. Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance such as a child.



Soft (porous) surfaces

For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely. Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 external icon and that are suitable for porous surfaces



Electronics

For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines, remove visible contamination if present. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.



L​inens, clothing, and other items that go in the laundry​

In order to minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.

Wash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people’s items.

Clean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry according to guidance above for hard or soft surfaces.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Hand Hygiene

The risk of exposure to cleaning staff is inherently low. Cleaning staff should wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash . Gloves and gowns should be compatible with the disinfectant products being used. Additional PPE might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash. Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area. Be sure to clean hands after removing gloves. If gowns are not available, coveralls, aprons or work uniforms can be worn during cleaning and disinfecting. Reusable (washable) clothing should be laundered afterwards. Clean hands after handling dirty laundry.

. Gloves should be removed after cleaning a room or area occupied by ill persons. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.

Cleaning staff should immediately report breaches in PPE such as a tear in gloves or any other potential exposures to their supervisor.

Cleaning staff and others should clean hands often , including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.

Additional Considerations for Employers",##########,
COVID-19 Guidance: Businesses and Employers,"Purpose

This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The outbreak first started in China, but the virus continues to spread internationally and in the United States. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other characteristics of COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. Updates are available on CDC’s web page at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/. CDC will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available.

This interim guidance may help prevent workplace exposures to COVID-19 in non-healthcare settings (separate guidance is available for healthcare settings). CDC has also provided guidance for critical infrastructure workers who may have had exposure to a person known or suspected to have COVID-19. Unless otherwise specified, this interim guidance for businesses and employers applies to critical infrastructure workplaces as well.

Role of Businesses and Employers in Responding to COVID-19

Businesses and employers can prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19 within the workplace. Employers should respond in a way that takes into account the level of disease transmission in their communities and revise their business response plans as needed. Employers should follow the White House Guidelines for Opening Up America Againexternal icon, a phased approach based on current levels of transmission and healthcare capacity at the state or local level, as part of resuming business operations. Business operation decisions should be based on both the level of disease transmission in the community and your readiness to protect the safety and health of your employees and customers.

Businesses and employers are encouraged to coordinate with stateexternal icon and localexternal icon health officials to obtain timely and accurate information to inform appropriate responses. Local conditions will influence the decisions that public health officials make regarding community-level strategies. CDC has guidance for mitigation strategiespdf icon according to the level of community transmission or impact of COVID-19.

As an employer, if your business operations were interrupted, resuming normal or phased activities presents an opportunity to update your COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plans. All employers should implement and update as necessary a plan that:

Is specific to your workplace,

identifies all areas and job tasks with potential exposures to COVID-19, and

includes control measures to eliminate or reduce such exposures.

Talk with your employees about planned changes and seek their input. Additionally, collaborate with employees and unions to effectively communicate important COVID-19 information.

See the OSHA COVID-19 guidancepdf iconexternal icon for more information on how to protect workers from potential exposures, according to their exposure risk. Plans should consider that employees may be able to spread COVID-19 even if they do not show symptoms.

All employers need to consider how best to decrease the spread of COVID-19 and lower the impact in your workplace. This should include activities to:",##########,
SARS-CoV-2 Testing Strategy: Considerations for Non-Healthcare Workplaces,"Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide employers with strategies for consideration of incorporating testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into a workplace COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plan.

Employers are encouraged to collaborate with state, territorial, tribal and local health officials to determine whether and how to implement the following testing strategies and which one(s) would be most appropriate for their circumstances. These considerations are meant to supplement, not replace, any federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which workplaces must comply. These strategies should be carried out in a manner consistent with law and regulation, including laws protecting employee privacy and confidentiality. They should also be carried out consistent with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidance regarding permissible testing policies and procedures. Employers paying for testing of employees should put procedures in place for rapid notification of results and establish appropriate measures based on testing results including instructions regarding self-isolation and restrictions on workplace access.

Considerations for use of a strategy to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection

SARS-CoV-2 testing may be incorporated as part of a comprehensive approach to reducing transmission in non-healthcare workplaces. Symptom screening, testing, and contact tracing pdf icon[58 pages] are strategies to identify workers infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so that actions can be taken to slow and stop the spread of the virus.

Employees undergoing testing should receive clear information on:

the manufacturer and name of the test, the type of test, the purpose of the test, the reliability of the test, any limitations associated with the test, who will pay for the test, and how the test will be performed, and

how to understand what the results mean, actions associated with negative or positive results, who will receive the results, how the results may be used, and any consequences for declining to be tested.

Individuals tested are required to receive patient fact sheets as part of the test’s emergency use authorizationexternal icon.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued interim guidanceexternal icon for enforcing the requirements of 29 CFR Part 1904external icon with respect to the recording of occupational illnesses, specifically cases of COVID-19. Under OSHA’s recordkeeping requirements, COVID-19 is a recordable illness, and thus employers are responsible for recording cases of COVID-19, if the case meets certain requirements. Employers are encouraged to frequently check OSHA’s webpage at www.osha.gov/coronavirusexternal icon for updates.

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection

Viral tests approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are used to diagnose current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Viral tests evaluate whether the virus is present in respiratory or other samples. Results from these tests help public health officials identify and isolate people who are infected in order to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Antibody tests approved or authorized by the FDA are used to detect past infection with SARS-CoV-2. CDC does not currently recommend using antibody testing as the sole basis for diagnosing current infection. Depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it is currently not known whether a positive antibody test indicates immunity against SARS-CoV-2; therefore, antibody tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune.

Categories for SARS-CoV-2 testing

CDC describes strategies for SARS-CoV-2 viral testing for five categories of people:

Testing individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19

Employers may consider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) to identify employees with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 before they enter a facility, in accordance with CDC’s General Business FAQs. Employers should follow guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionexternal icon regarding confidentiality of medical records from health checks.

Workers with COVID-19 symptoms should be immediately separated from other employees, customers, and visitors, and sent home or to a healthcare facility, depending on how severe their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for oneself. To prevent stigma and discrimination in the workplace, make employee health screenings as private as possible. Consistent with CDC’s recommendations, workers with COVID-19 symptoms should be referred to a healthcare provider for evaluation and potential testing. Waiting for test results prior to returning to work is preferred to keep potentially infected workers out of the workplace.

Employers are encouraged to implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices as part of a comprehensive approach to prevent and reduce transmission among employees. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA or Act) requires certain employersexternal icon to provide their employees with paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19. Employers with fewer than 500 employees are eligible for 100% tax creditsexternal icon for Families First Coronavirus Response Act COVID-19 paid leave provided through December 31, 2020, up to certain limits.

Positive test results using a viral test indicate that the employee has COVID-19 and should not come to work and should isolate at home. Decisions to discontinue home isolation for workers with COVID-19 and allow them to return to work may follow either a symptom-based, time based, or a test-based strategy (see Testing to determine resolution of infection below).

Testing asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission

Case investigation is typically initiated when a health department receives a report from a laboratory of a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test result or a report from a healthcare provider of a patient with a confirmed or probable diagnosis of COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon .

Viral testing may be recommended for close contacts (people who have been within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more) of persons with COVID-19 in jurisdictions with testing capacity. Because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it is important that individuals exposed to people with known or suspected COVID-19 be quickly identified and quarantined. Viral testing can detect if these individuals are currently infected. The health department may reach out to the employer for assistance in identifying close contacts of the worker as well as possible contacts. Employers are encouraged to work with public health departments investigating cases of COVID-19 and tracing contacts to help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in their workplaces and communities.

Because there may be a delay between the time a person is exposed to the virus and the time that virus can be detected by testing, early testing after exposure at a single time point may miss many infections1. Testing that is repeated at different points in time, also referred to as serial testing, may be more likely to detect infection among close contacts of a COVID-19 case than testing done at a single point in time.

Even if close contacts are monitored with serial testing, it is critical that they strictly adhere to other preventive measures including social distancing, wearing cloth face coverings for source control if the hazard assessment has determined that they do not require personal protective equipment such as a respirator or medical facemask for protection, and practicing hand hygiene.

Testing may also be considered for possible close contacts of persons diagnosed with COVID-19 in collaboration with the local health department if resources permit. A risk-based approach to testing possible contacts of a person with confirmed COVID-19 may be applied. Such an approach should take into consideration the likelihood of exposure, which is affected by the characteristics of the workplace and the results of contact investigations. In some settings, broader testing (i.e., testing beyond individually identified close contacts to those who are possible close contacts), such as targeting workers who worked in the same area and during the same shift, may be considered as part of a strategy to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace. The rationale is that identification of contacts may be imprecise. High-risk settings that have demonstrated potential for rapid and widespread dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 include:

High-density critical infrastructure workplaces

Workplaces where employees live in congregate settings (e.g., fishing vessels, offshore oil platforms, farmworker housing or wildland firefighter camps)

Workplaces with populations at risk for severe illness if they are infected, such as nursing homes

Employers are encouraged to consult with state, local, territorial, and tribal health departments to help inform decision-making about broad-based testing.

If employees are tested after close contact or possible close contact with someone who has a confirmed or probable diagnosis of COVID-19, care should be taken to inform these employees of their possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace while maintaining confidentiality of the individual with COVID-19, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Actexternal icon (ADA) and consistent with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidance regarding What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Lawsexternal icon.

Testing asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification in special settings

Viral testing of workers without symptoms may be useful to detect COVID-19 early and stop transmission quickly, particularly in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission. When communities experience moderate to substantial transmission, workplace settings for which these approaches may be considered include:

Workplaces where physical distancing is difficult and workers are in close contact with co-workers or the public

Workplaces in remote settings where medical evaluation or treatment may be delayed

Workplaces where continuity of operations is a high priority (e.g., critical infrastructure sectors external icon )

) Workplaces providing congregate housing for employees (e.g. fishing vessels, offshore oil platforms, farmworker housing or wildland firefighter camps)

Approaches may include initial testing of all workers before entering a workplace, periodic testing of workers at regular intervals, and/or targeted testing of new workers or those returning from a prolonged absence. Several factors may be helpful in determining the interval for periodic testing including:

The availability of testing

The latency between exposure and development of a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test

Businesses that fall into one of the workplace categories described above

The rate or change in rate of people getting infected in the surrounding community

How many employees tested positive during previous rounds of testing

Your relevant experience with workplace outbreaks

State, local, territorial, and tribal health departments may be able to provide assistance on any local context or guidance impacting the workplace. Before testing a large proportion of asymptomatic workers without known or suspected exposure, employers are encouraged to have a plan in place for how they will modify operations based on test results and manage a higher risk of false positive results in a low prevalence population.

Testing to determine resolution of infection

The decision to end home isolation and return to work for employees with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should be made in the context of clinical and local circumstances. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification tests have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in some people’s respiratory samples after they have recovered from COVID-19. Prolonged viral shedding has been demonstrated without direct evidence for virus capable of replicating or causing infection. Consequently, in most cases, evidence supports a symptom-based strategy to determine when to discontinue home isolation or precautions. For persons who are severely immunocompromised, a test-based strategy could be considered in consultation with infectious diseases experts. For all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or precautions earlier than would occur under the symptom-based strategy.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, employers are permitted to require a healthcare provider’s noteexternal icon to verify that employees are healthy and able to return to work. However, as a practical matter, employers should be aware that healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy during periods of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and may not be able to provide such documentation in a timely manner. In such cases, employers should consider not requiring a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness, can recover at home without medical care, and can follow CDC recommendations to determine when to discontinue home isolation and return to work.

Public health surveillance for SARS-CoV-2

Testing is considered to be surveillance when conducted to detect transmission hot spots, or to better understand disease trends in a workplace. These goals are consistent with employer-based occupational medicine surveillance programs. Occupational medicine surveillance programs may use testing to assess the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in the workforce, assess factors that place employees at risk for workplace acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, or evaluate the effectiveness of workplace infection control programs. Surveillance should only be undertaken if the results have a reasonable likelihood of benefiting workers.

Considerations for Outdoor Farmers Markets,"Farmers market managers should consider the recommendations below to help ensure safe access to food while helping prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges to food security in the United States. Access to healthy food options and nutrition are an important part of overall physical and mental health. Across the United States, farmers markets have been named an essential service because of their role in supporting local farms and providing communities access to fresh, healthy food during the pandemic. Outdoor farmers markets provide a lower risk shopping option with immediate and lasting benefits for shoppers and the community at-large.

These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations that organizations must follow. Farmers market managers should collaborate with state and local health officials to determine whether to implement these considerations as-is or tailor them to their community’s needs. Farmers market managers should continue monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in the community they serve and have a plan in place to adjust their operations as needed.

Farmers market managers may also benefit from reviewing CDC’s COVID-19 guidance and considerations on community based organizations, workplaces, events and gatherings, and food service providers. Farmers market managers should consider CDC’s information on people at higher risk of severe illness .

Slowing the spread of COVID-19

Coronaviruses, such as the one that causes COVID-19, are thought to spread mostly from person to person through respiratory droplets emitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The droplets containing virus are spread in the air and can be inhaled in the lungs or land on the mouth, nose or eyes of people nearby. A person also might be exposed to the virus causing COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, including food or food packaging, that has been contaminated with the virus when an infected person coughs or sneezes near it, and then touches their own mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Risk of transmission from food, food packaging, and shopping bags is considered very low, but there are other, possible routes of COVID-19 transmission, such as:

Being in close contact (within 6 feet) with people you don’t live with, especially people who are not wearing a mask. The more people you interact with, and the longer those interactions last, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread;

Touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your own mouth, nose, or eyes.

Outdoor activities generally are lower risk than indoor activities but there are still important ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 that should be followed:

Promote healthy behaviors

Encourage people to stay home when sick.

Staff, volunteers, and vendors should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms , or have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of, or diagnosed with, COVID-19.

or have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of, or diagnosed with, COVID-19. Educate staff, volunteers, and vendors about when they should stay home and when it is safe to be around others .

Actively encourage customers using signage, social media, or other communication platforms that your market commonly uses, to stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms , or have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of, or diagnosed with, COVID-19.

Encourage people to socially distance.

Staying at least six feet apart from others, even when you are outside, reduces the chance that you will be exposed to the virus from respiratory droplets emitted by others.

Many people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or no symptoms, but they can still spread the virus to others. Staying apart reduces your risk of getting COVID-19.

Social distancing is most effective when it is used along with other prevention strategies, including wearing masks.

Masks

Require staff, volunteers, and vendors to use masks. Masks are an important means of reducing viral spread and are essential during times when social distancing is difficult. Provide information to all staff and volunteers on proper use and washing of masks.

If feasible, provide masks for staff, volunteers, and vendors and consider asking them to bring extra masks, in case their mask gets wet or soiled, as well as a sealable plastic bag or other container to store masks when not in use.

Encourage customers to bring and use masks. If feasible, provide masks for those who may not have one.

Hand hygiene

Provide handwashing stations or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol for all, including customers, market staff, volunteers, and vendors, and encourage vendors to offer the same at their booth.

Proper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure. Ensure vendors, market staff, and volunteers wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available or accessible, provide an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Key times to clean hands in general include: Before, during, and after preparing or handling food Before eating food After using the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing After touching frequently touched surfaces After putting on, touching, or removing masks

Additional workplace-specific times to clean hands include: Before and after work shifts and periodically throughout shift Before and after work breaks After touching money or objects that have been handled by customers, such as produce, other market food, and reusable grocery bags Before putting on and taking off disposable gloves After taking out the trash



Clear signage and communications

Ensure that all staff, volunteers, vendors, and customers are aware of market policies and procedures. Signs with market hours of operation and safety precautions should be posted at each entrance/exit and near shared areas. If possible, make the same information available on your website and social media platforms.

Post signs in highly visible locations (e.g., at building entrances, in restrooms) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread pdf icon of germs by properly washing hands and properly wearing a mask image icon .

of germs by properly washing hands and properly wearing a mask . Consider developing signs and messages in different formats (e.g., large print, Braille, American Sign Language) for people who have low vision.

Consider adding signs in other languages commonly spoken in your community and visuals tailored for low literacy audiences.

Maintain healthy environments

Consider modifications you can make to promote social distancing, including:

Providing different ways for ordering and pick-up to reduce the number of in-person interactions (e.g., curbside box pickup). Set up designated pick-up areas.

Where possible, redesigning market layouts to increase the distance between customers in line and walking throughout the market (e.g., increase space between vendor booths; create one-way traffic flow). Ensure that market layout modifications are accessible for all persons (e.g., ADA-compliant paths).

Limiting the number of customers to reduce crowding and lines to meet social distancing guidelines.

Installing physical barriers like sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., vendor booths).

Posting clear and prominent directional and physical distancing signage for all walkways, entry and exit ways, vendor booths, and spaces that can easily become crowded (e.g., customers waiting in line).

Safe operations include:

Being aware of local and state regulatory agency policies related to providing essential services and group gatherings to determine if your market can be held, and if there are restrictions limiting the number of attendees or vendors.

Limiting market activities that target individuals identified as higher risk for serious illness for COVID-19, if feasible. If these events or activities continue to be offered, consider creating a schedule that includes special shopping hours for at-risk or vulnerable populations (e.g., senior shopping hours).

Where feasible, implementing cashless payment systems and continue to accept SNAP EBT. If your market traditionally uses hard to-clean vouchers (e.g., wooden tokens) for SNAP EBT transactions or other incentives, consider alternatives.

When exchanging paper and coin money Do not touch your face afterwards. Ask customers to place cash on the table or directly in a cashbox, rather than directly into your hand. Place money directly on the table when providing change back to customers. Wipe the table between each customer at checkout.

Avoiding using cloth table coverings or other hard to clean table covers.

If possible, vendor booths should have a designated person for handling cash/tokens and another for handling food or food products.

Limiting or suspending taste testing, cooking demonstrations, and/or other food sampling activities.

If your market offers prepared food for immediate consumption, consider limiting to take-out orders only.

Consider limiting or suspending non-essential market services or events like live music.

Discouraging customers from touching items they do not plan to purchase.

Consider regular symptom screenings of staff, vendors or others that come onsite, and have a plan for if anyone arrives or becomes ill. For guidance related to screening of staff, please refer to CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the “Prevent Transmission Among Employees” section of CDC’s Resuming Business Toolkit pdf icon .

. Train staff, volunteers, and vendors on new COVID-19 procedures. If possible, conduct training virtually so all can attend, and no crowds will gather.

Require staff, volunteers, and vendors to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water (or use hand sanitizer) frequently before, during, and after shifts.

Consider asking vendors to pre-bag or pre-portion items for sale prior to market.

Staggering eating/break times and identify a designated area for staff and volunteers to take breaks where social distancing can be maintained.

Discouraging customers and vendors from bringing pets except — service animals — to the market.

Cleaning and disinfection

Follow CDC and EPA’s Guidance on Cleaning and Disinfection to prepare and maintain a safe environment for your market workforce, volunteers, vendors and customers. Use EPA-approved disinfectants against the virus that causes COVID-19pdf icon. Always read and follow label instructions for each product.

Routinely clean, sanitize, and disinfect payment devices, tables, and other high touch surfaces and objects. Require participating market vendors to do the same.

If you have restrooms or port-a-potties, set up a schedule to frequently clean and disinfect all surfaces, and replenish soap, sanitizers, or paper products.

Limit or suspend the use of items that are hard to clean and disinfect (e.g., wooden tokens).

Use disposable gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash: After using disposable gloves, throw them out in a lined trash can. Do not disinfect or reuse the gloves. Wash hands after removing gloves.

Ensure you have enough supplies for market workforce, volunteers, and customers to clean their hands and cover their coughs and sneezes. Supplies include soap, water, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, a way to dry hands, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch trash cans.

Conserving Filtering Facepiece Respirator Supply,"Audience: This guidance is intended for use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency by federal, state, and local public health officials, respiratory protection program managers, leaders in occupational health services and industrial hygiene programs, and other leaders who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing occupational exposures in non-healthcare worksites.

Purpose: This document offers strategies to conserve, extend, and respond to shortages in the supply of NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) used in non-healthcare worksites such as manufacturing and construction. NIOSH-approved FFRs protect users by filtering particles out of the air the user is breathing and include several classes of filters, including N95s.

The following strategies apply the principles of the hierarchy of controls and are intended to assist employers in selecting strategies to control workplace exposures during times of known supply shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies 1 and 2 reinforce employer requirements for the continuous evaluation and implementation of traditional hazard control practices such as elimination, substitution, engineering and administration controls. Other strategies described herein include certain allowances such as use of FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life to be incorporated into practice only during times of supply shortages during the COVID-19 public health emergency.

A secondary purpose is to reduce the demand for FFRs in general industry settings during the COVID-19 response so that (1) FFR manufacturers and distributors can maximize supplies to healthcare settings and (2) general industry worksites can evaluate if any excess inventories they may hold are suitable for redistributing (e.g., selling, donating) to healthcare settings. Employers should consider redistribution of excess inventories only if adequate exposure controls for their workers are implemented. For guidance to prevent workplace exposures to acute respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, please see CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers.

Background

The expanding outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States has created an overwhelming demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), including NIOSH-approved FFRs, in healthcare facilities across the country. Additionally, the supply chains of PPE from manufacturing countries have been substantially disrupted due to local COVID-19 spread and demand. Because of this increase in demand and decrease in supply, CDC has provided guidance to healthcare settings for strategies to optimize their supply of N95 respirators. This guidance describes surge capacity for healthcare facilities providing care in conventional, contingency, and crisis situations. The decisions to implement measures for healthcare facilities in contingency and crisis situations are based, in part, on the availability of N95 respirators, specifically, and other types of respirators, in general.

In recognition of the demand for FFRs in the healthcare setting and the priority to protect healthcare workers who are the workers at highest risk for COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued two emergency use authorizationsexternal icon to allow FFRs not typically worn in healthcare settings to be worn. This may reduce the availability of these FFRs for other worksites.

Users of NIOSH-approved FFRs in non-healthcare settings should develop and implement strategies to conserve and extend their current stock of respirator supplies while protecting their workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employers should implement alternative controls to reduce, as much as possible, their reliance on PPE, particularly FFRs. Conventionally, a hierarchy of controls has been used to provide feasible and effective controls to protect workers. Multiple control strategies can be implemented concurrently and/or sequentially. This hierarchy can be described as follows:

Elimination

Substitution

Engineering controls

Administrative controls

Personal protective equipment (PPE)

Elimination and Substitution

Employers should evaluate work tasks and processes to identify those activities or processes where the elimination or substitution of hazards may be implemented. While the most effective at controlling hazards, these may be the most difficult to implement in existing processes, particularly during times of national or local emergencies.

Engineering Controls

Engineering controls reduce workers’ exposures by placing a barrier between the hazard and the worker or removing the hazard at the source. While the initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than the cost of administrative controls or PPE, engineering controls generally provide a cost savings over the longer term and can eliminate the need for respirators if properly designed, implemented, and maintained. Examples for consideration includes:

Local exhaust ventilation

Wet methods (when water is sprayed on a dusty surface or when a material is mixed with water to prevent aerosolization)

Glove boxes, cabinets, or other enclosures for isolation of the hazard

Administrative Controls

Administrative controls are used with existing processes to limit or prevent a hazard by changing the way people work. Examples include:

Job rotation in which workers change job tasks or areas to reduce their exposures and the need to be in respiratory protection

Establishing policies and implementing procedures limiting the amount of time that an individual worker can work on a specific job task or in areas with high exposures

Training workers on the hazards and controls available to reduce exposures

Installing warning labels and signs to remind workers to stay away from hazardous job tasks or areas

Personal Protective Equipment

While engineering and administrative controls should be considered first when implementing controls, PPE can be part of a suite of strategies used to protect workers. PPE includes respirators, protective gloves, protective eyewear and face shields, and a variety of other protective gear. PPE is frequently used with existing processes where hazards are not particularly well-controlled. This method for protecting workers is typically less effective than other measures due to the reliance on the user to put on, use, and take off the PPE correctly and the potential for PPE breaches. Additionally, proper use of respiratory protection requires a comprehensive program (including medical clearance, training, and fit testing) that complies with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection Standardexternal icon.

Recommendations

In times of high demand and low supply of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic, non-healthcare sector employers should evaluate current work practices and control strategies to create a strategic exposure prevention and control plan to continue to protect workers. As part of such a plan, strategies for employers to consider are prioritized below. These measures are recommended to conserve and extend their FFR supply and to respond to shortages of manufacturer-supplied FFRs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has also provided guidanceexternal icon on many of these measures related to their enforcement of the Respiratory Protection Standard, 29 CFR 1910.134external icon, and certain other health standards, with regard to supply shortages of disposable N95 FFRs.

The following measures emphasize engineering and administrative controls to implement for exposure prevention and control plans and to reduce reliance on FFRs

Evaluate and execute long-term strategies for the elimination and substitution of hazards and the implementation of engineering controls for processes in which FFRs are currently required. NIOSH engineering control strategies are outlined for a variety of industries and hazards online Industry- and process-specific control strategies are detailed by the British Health and Safety Executive as a part of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Essentials external icon and are available online Implement immediately feasible engineering and administrative controls to eliminate or minimize exposures for which employers are currently requiring the use of FFRs. These controls should be routinely evaluated to ensure they continue to control exposures to acceptable levels and include: Moving work to inside ventilated enclosures such as fume hoods and biological safety cabinets. Modifying the processes to reduce exposures, such as putting dry materials into a wet slurry to reduce the potential for exposure. Postponing non-essential work requiring the use of FFRs. Limiting the number of workers needing respirators to the minimum required to safely complete the task. Arranging work/production schedules to reduce the number of respirators needed.

The following measures may require changes in daily standard respiratory protection practices but may not have significant impact and may be used temporarily during periods of expected FFR shortages

Use qualitative methods to fit test workers for FFRs external icon . Quantitative fit test methods require consuming FFRs during the fit test, while qualitative do not. As such, qualitative fit testing methods would conserve FFRs to be used for controlling workplace exposures. Transition respiratory protection programs to use NIOSH-approved alternatives to FFRs, where feasible. NIOSH maintains a searchable, online version of the certified equipment list identifying all NIOSH-approved respirators. Alternatives to FFRs, in order of preference to implement at non-healthcare worksites in order to preserve as many N95s as possible for healthcare settings, include: Elastomeric half facepiece air-purifying respirators: tight-fitting respirators that are made of synthetic or rubber material permitting them to be repeatedly disinfected, cleaned, and reused. They are equipped with exchangeable filter cartridges. Elastomeric full facepiece air-purifying respirators: Like the elastomeric half facepiece respirator, the elastomeric full facepiece respirator is a reusable device that uses exchangeable filter cartridges but has a clear plastic lens that covers the face and provides eye protection. Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs): reusable respirators that typically have loose-fitting hoods or helmets. These respirators are battery-powered with a blower that pulls air through attached filters or cartridges. The filter is typically a high efficiency (HE) filter. Loose-fitting PAPRs do not require fit testing and can be worn by people with facial hair. When non-PPE controls cannot feasibly be implemented and when no alternative respirators to FFRs can be obtained, conserve current FFR supplies on-hand by extending the employer’s schedule for when they are disposed and replaced. For companies with policies allowing the regular disposal and replacement of N95s and other FFRs, extended use of these FFRs beyond normal change-out schedules, when acceptable, can also be considered. The decision to implement policies that permit extended use of FFRs should be made by the professionals who manage the institution’s respiratory protection program. Criteria for disposing and replacing FFRs include when breathing through the filter material becomes too restricted rather than simply disposing of them on a regularly scheduled basis such as after a single shift. In such cases, proper training on storage of used respirators is required. Use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training and fit testing. In times of shortage, you may be able to use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training and fit testing purposes. However, expired respirators might not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the strap and filter material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Using such respirators for training and fit testing would allow non-expired N95 FFRs to be used for normal work operations. Use respirators approved under standards used in other countries that are similar to NIOSH-approved FFRs. (See Table 1.) Within Table 1, the country, conformity assessment standards, standards and guidance documents, acceptable product classification, and NIOSH classification are provided in alphabetical order. All of these respirators have protection factors of at least 10 in the countries listed in the table, as outlined in the standards and guidance documents specified. NIOSH has confidence that devices supplied by current NIOSH-approval holders producing respirators under the various standards authorized in other countries are expected to provide the protection indicated, given that a proper fit is achieved. Non-NIOSH-approved products developed by manufacturers who are not NIOSH approval holders, including those approved by and received from China, should only be used in crisis situations when no other NIOSH-approved N95 respirator or a listed device from one of the other recognized countries is available. To ensure this level of confidence, NIOSH has developed an assessment to evaluate the filter efficiency of respirators from other countries. NIOSH is happy to conduct the testing for you and provide you the results of the testing. The webpages to request respirator assessments are available.

The following measures may need to be considered during periods of known respirator shortages

Use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for work operations. Consideration can be made to use FFRs beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for work operations when no other controls or respiratory protection are available. Respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life may not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the straps and nose bridge material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Many models found in U.S. stockpiles have been found to continue to perform in accordance with NIOSH performance standards. Users should take the following precautionary measures prior to using the respirator in the workplace. Visually inspect the FFR to determine if its integrity has been compromised. Check that components such as the straps, nose bridge, and nose foam material did not degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal and therefore the effectiveness of the respirator. If the integrity of any part of the respirator is compromised, discard the respirator and try another respirator. Users should perform a user seal check immediately after they don each respirator and should not use a respirator on which they cannot perform a successful user seal check.

When the above control steps are not feasible, FFR and higher levels of respiratory protection are unavailable, and alternative respiratory protection strategies are not possible, it is recommended that work activities requiring such protection be suspended.

Evaluating N95 FFR Inventories Held by General Industry for Transfer to Healthcare Settings

Employers who successfully implement strategies for conserving and extending their FFR supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic may find that they possess excess inventories. It is recommended that employers consider redistributing (e.g., selling, donating) available excess inventories to healthcare settings during the COVID-19 pandemic to help reduce known shortages of respirators. Worksites that are no longer active due to emergency work stoppages and restrictions are encouraged to consider redistributing their excess PPE and fit test kits to their state medical countermeasure contacts, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)external icon, or through other appropriate channels. Non-healthcare employers who bought large quantities of respirators in the months preceding the crisis should consider if they are willing to redistribute (e.g., sell, donate) those respirators for healthcare use.

CDC Interim Guidance for Critical Infrastructure Workers Exposed to COVID-19

CDC’s critical infrastructure guidance provides exceptions to current home quarantine practices after an exposure to COVID-19. The guidance advises that employers may permit workers who have had an exposure to COVID-19, but who do not have symptoms, to continue to work, provided they adhere to additional safety precautions, such as measuring the employee’s temperature and assessing for symptoms of COVID-19 before each work shift (“pre-screening”), asking the employee to self-monitor for symptoms during their work shift, and wearing a cloth face covering. While this guidance is designed to ensure that work in critical infrastructure sectors can continue, critical infrastructure employers have an obligation to manage the continuation of work in a way that best protects the health of their workers and the general public.

When following the CDC interim guidance, consider adapting your COVID-19 business response plan with the following elements:

Maintain healthy business operations

Reintegrating exposed, asymptomatic workers to onsite operations, while discussed in the critical infrastructure guidance, should not be misinterpreted as always being the first or most appropriate option to pursue in managing critical work tasks. Home isolation may still be the most preferred and viable option for exposed workers.

Minimize the number of workers present at worksites, balancing the need to protect workers with support for continuing critical operations.

Anticipate and monitor staff absences due to illness or exposure by: Identifying and prioritizing job functions essential for continuous operation, Cross-training employees to perform critical job functions so the workplace can operate even if key employees are absent, and Matching critical job functions with other equally skilled and available workers who have not experienced an exposure to COVID-19.

Consider special accommodations (e.g., telework, reassignment of duties to minimize contact with others) for employees who are members of a vulnerable population.

Reduce transmission among employees and the public

Actively encourage sick employees to stay home.

Immediately send any employee who becomes sick during the day home or to seek further care from a healthcare provider.

Have sick employees follow CDC-recommended guidance. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.

Pre-screen employees (e.g., measuring the employee’s temperature and assessing symptoms of COVID-19 prior to starting work) and perform regular medical monitoring (e.g., the employee should self-monitor for symptoms or follow up with the employer’s occupational health program) of exposed workers. Consult with an occupational health provider and state and/or local health officials to ensure that medical monitoring is conducted appropriately.

Ensure exposed workers wear a facemask or cloth face covering in accordance with CDC and OSHA guidance and any state or local requirements.

Implement social distancing to minimize the chances of workers exposing one another.

Educate employees about how they can reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Testing Strategy for Coronavirus (COVID-19) in High-Density Critical Infrastructure Workplaces after a COVID-19 Case Is Identified,"Summary of Changes Revisions made on October 21, 2020 Added links to the updated close contact definition.

Updated language to align with updated definition.

Workers in critical infrastructure sectors may be permitted to work if asymptomatic after potential exposure to a confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), provided that worker infection prevention recommendations and controls are implemented. Outbreaks of illness among workers in food-producing facilities and surrounding communities have raised unique questions that identified the need for testing for COVID-19 to supplement existing guidance. This document presents different testing strategy options for exposed co-workers when public health organizations and employers determine testing is needed to help support existing disease control measures. Such strategies can aid in identifying infectious individuals with the goal of reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace. These strategies augment and do not replace existing guidance.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is primarily spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Workers in high-density settings in which workers are in the workplace for long time periods (e.g., for 8-12 hours per shift), and have prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for 15 minutes or more) with coworkers may be at increased risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2. A close contact is defined in existing Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure. Other distinctive factors that may increase risk for transmission among these workers include: sharing transportation such as ride-share vans or shuttle vehicles, car-pools, and public transportation; frequent contact with fellow workers in community settings in areas where there is ongoing community transmission; and shared or congregate housing such as dormitories. Workers include, but are not limited to, all employees, contractors, and others who perform work at the facility or worksite. Early experience from COVID-19 outbreaks in a variety of settings suggests that when symptomatic workers with COVID-19 are identified, there are often asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic workers with SARS-CoV-2 present at the workplace. Testing is important to identify such individuals, as they may not know they are infected. SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic persons can result in additional cases and potentially outbreaks of COVID-19. Implementing screening for symptoms of COVID-19, testing, and contact tracingpdf icon may be used to detect infected workers earlier and exclude them from the workplace, thus preventing disease transmission and subsequent outbreaks.[1–3]

Critical infrastructure employers have an obligation to manage the continuation of work in a way that best protects the health of their workers and the general public. Appropriate workplace protections, such as engineering and administrative controls, for those present in the workplace should remain in place. Examples of these controls can be found in existing guidance for Meat and Poultry Processing Workers and Employers, and for Manufacturing Workers and Employers and other critical infrastructure guidancepdf iconexternal icon. Screening1 workers and others entering the workplace for symptoms of COVID-19 and body temperature is a critical component of preventing transmission and protecting workers. Workplaces should review and follow existing guidance. Workers who are symptomatic upon arrival at work, or who become sick during the day, should immediately be separated from others. They should be sent to their home or a health care facility, as appropriate, and referred for further evaluation and testing in consultation with the state, territorial, or local health departments or through occupational health providers.

After a COVID-19 case is identified, testing strategies of exposed co-workers may be considered to help prevent disease spread, to identify the scope and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to inform additional prevention and control efforts that might be needed.

Viral (nucleic acid or antigen) testing should be used to diagnose acute infection.

Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: (1) viral tests to detect current infections, and (2) antibody tests to identify previous infections. CDC provides an overview of categories of people for SARS-CoV-2 testing with viral tests (i.e., nucleic acid or antigen tests). Viral testing can be used to inform actions necessary to keep SARS-CoV-2 out of the workplace, detect COVID-19 cases quickly, and stop transmission. Testing practices should aim for rapid turnaround times in order to facilitate effective action. Viral testing detects infection at the time the sample is collected; very early infection at the time of sample collection or exposure (e.g., workplace or community) after sample collection can result in undetected infection. Testing at different points in time, also referred to as serial testing, may be more likely to detect acute infection among workers with repeat exposures than testing done at a single point in time.

At the current time, antibody test results should not be used to diagnose someone with an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Refer to the CDC website for additional information regarding testing for COVID-19 and specimen collection.

Considerations for use of a testing strategy for COVID-19 infection:

What Workers and Employers Can Do to Manage Workplace Fatigue during COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has touched all aspects of society including how we work. Emergency responders, health care workers, and others providing essential services to the community have been especially stretched thin, working longer hours than usual, working more shifts or even over-night, and leaving less time to sleep and recharge.

Under regular circumstances, adults need 7–9 hours of sleep per night, along with opportunities for rest while awake, optimal health, and well-being. Long work hours and shift work, combined with stressful or physically demanding work, can lead to poor sleep and extreme fatigue. Fatigue increases the risk for injury and deteriorating health (infections, illnesses, and mental health disorders).

While there is no one solution to fit everyone’s needs, here are some general strategies that workers and employers can use to manage workplace fatigue and work safely.",##########,
COVID-19 - School Reopening: Indicators to Inform Decision Making,"It is critical for schools to open as safely and as quickly as possible for in-person learning. To enable schools to open and remain open, it is important to adopt and correctly and consistently implement actions to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, not only inside the school, but also in the community. This means that students, families, teachers, school staff, and all community members should take actions to protect themselves and others where they live, work, learn, and play. In short, success in preventing the introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools is connected to and dependent upon preventing transmission in communities.

Background

Schools are an important part of the infrastructure of communities, as they provide safe, supportive learning environments for students, employ teachers and other staff, and enable parents, guardians, and caregivers to work. Schools also help to mitigate health disparities by providing critical services including school meal programs and social, physical, behavioral, and mental health services. SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools may be a reflection of transmission in the surrounding community. Therefore, when making decisions on when to open schools for in-person learning it is important to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the surrounding community to determine the possible risk of introduction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the school.

International and domestic experiences have demonstrated that even when a school carefully coordinates, plans, and prepares for reopening, cases of COVID-19 may still occur. Expecting and planning for the occurrence of one or more cases of COVID-19 in schools can help respond immediately to mitigate the impact to allow the school to remain open for in-person learning, if appropriate. When mitigation strategies are consistently and correctly used, the risk of spread within the school environment and the surrounding community is decreased.

Purpose of indicators

During the COVID-19 pandemic, States, Tribes, Localities, Territories (STLT) and school districts have been making decisions about when and how to safely open schools. Many STLTs, partners, and members of the public have asked CDC how to determine when it is safe to open schools for in-person learning. There is no easy answer or single indicator. Many variables must be considered.

This document proposes core and secondary indicators that STLTs can use to aid in their decision-making process regarding school reopening for in-person learning. In-person learning includes all classes and activities conducted during core school hours. It does not explicitly include extracurricular activities — like sports or theater — conducted after school hours. However, these indicators could also be used to determine whether and how to implement extracurricular activities with the necessary mitigation strategies in place.

This document is meant to assist STLT officials in making decisions rather than establishing regulatory requirements. Recommendations are based on CDC’s current knowledge of COVID-19 in the United States. CDC will continue to monitor COVID-19 activity and update guidance as needed. This guidance is meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which schools must comply.

Each STLT should decide the most appropriate indicators to reference when deciding to open, close, or reopen schools. CDC recommends the use of 3 core indicators. These core indicators include two measures of community burden (number of new cases per 100,000 persons in the past 14 days; and percentage of RT-PCR tests that are positive during the last 14 days) AND one self-assessed measure of school implementation of key mitigation strategies. CDC suggests decision-makers use one or both of the first core measures of community burden in addition to a third core indicator, the self-assessed measure of school implementation of key mitigation strategies. These key mitigation strategies should be implemented to the largest extent possible.

The two measures of community burden should be used to assess the incidence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the surrounding community (e.g., county) and not in the schools themselves. Currently, CDC does not recommend using these core indicators as measures of burden within the school.

Secondary indicators may also be used to complement the core indicators and further support actions taken. The list of secondary indicators is illustrative and is not meant to be exhaustive.

Other factors should also be considered in local decision-making – including the extent to which mitigation strategies are adhered to in the broader community. Local officials should seek out other sources of data to assess adherence to recommended mitigation strategies within the community. Each STLT can decide the most appropriate indicators to reference when deciding to open, close, or reopen schools.

Finally, the thresholds provided with each indicator should serve as a guide of inherent risk at the local level.

Description of indicators

The following are core and secondary indicators for decision makers to consider when deciding to open, close, or reopen schools over time. The core indicators include measures of underlying community transmission as well as a measure of adherence to key mitigation strategies.

Core indicators

Core indicators include one or both measures of community burden AND one self-assessed measure of school implementation of key mitigation strategies. Additional information including how to calculate these indicators is found in the table below.

Measures of community burden

The number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 14 days, AND/OR

The percentage of RT-PCR tests that are positive during the last 14 days, AND

Implementation of mitigation strategies

Schools should adopt the additional mitigation measures outlined below to the largest extent possible, practical and feasible.

Secondary indicators

Additionally, we provide secondary indicators that officials can use to support the decision-making process in local communities. These secondary indicators should not be used as the main criteria for determining the risk of disease transmission in schools. They should be used to support decision-making derived from the core indicators.

For example, knowing the percentage of hospital beds and intensive care unit beds occupied in a local hospital, including the percentage of inpatient beds occupied by a patient with COVID-19, can indicate the severity of illness in the community and whether the health care system can serve more patients. Similarly, the identification of a community outbreak indicates increased community transmission and, therefore, elevated risk of the introduction and subsequent transmission in schools.

Application and interpretation of indicators

Each indicator or combination of indicators should neither be used in isolation nor should they be viewed as hard cut-offs by STLT officials and school district decision-makers. Rather, they serve as broad guideposts of inherent risk to inform decision-making.

If, after applying the core indicators described in the table below, a school is at “medium,” “higher,” or “highest” risk of transmission, it does not mean that the school cannot re-open for in-person learning, but that the risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is higher and the school could consider alternative learning models (e.g., mix of in-person and virtual learning, also known as hybrid learning, or virtual-only).

Similarly, if a school meets all core indicators and many secondary indicators, a case or cases of COVID-19 may still occur in a school among students, teachers, administrators, and other staff. As a result, falling into the category of being at “lower” or “lowest” risk of transmission does not mean that the school should relax adherence to mitigation measures.

Officials should frequently monitor these indicators and adjust accordingly.

While risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a school may be lower when indicators of community spread are lower, this risk is dependent upon the implementation of school and community mitigation strategies. If community transmission is low but school and community mitigation strategies are not implemented, then the risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a school will increase. Alternately, if community transmission is high, but school and community mitigation strategies are implemented and strictly followed as recommended, then the risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a school will decrease.

Regardless of the level of risk, as determined by the indicators, it is critical that schools use multiple mitigation strategies including consistent and correct use of masks, social distancing to the extent possible, hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, cleaning and disinfection, and contact tracing to help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Vigilance to mitigation strategies within schools and the broader community will reduce the risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. This will enable schools that are open for in-person learning to stay open and accelerate the timeline of returning to full in-person learning by schools that began the school year using hybrid or virtual learning. The application and utility of these indicators are inextricably linked to schools and communities both following recommended mitigation strategies together.

By rigorously following mitigation strategies, current and future risk of introduction and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools can diminish over time regardless of baseline indicators – with risk of spread especially low when community transmission is low to begin with.",##########,

COVID-19 cases in the school

A school might need to implement short-term closure procedures regardless of community spread if an infected person has been in a school building. In addition, CDC recommends cleaning and disinfecting the school building thoroughly by:

Closing off areas used by the persons with COVID-19 for a significant amount of time. School administrators and staff may define this length of time (usually 15 minutes or longer) based on their specific needs and policies. Waiting as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection to minimize potential for exposure to respiratory droplets. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area.

If possible, wait up to 24 hours before beginning cleaning and disinfection. Cleaning and disinfecting all areas (e.g., offices, bathrooms, and common areas) used by the person(s) with COVID-19, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces. Surfaces should be cleaned using soap (or a detergent) and water prior to disinfection.

Disinfect with a disinfectant on List N: Disinfectants for use against SARs-CoV-2, external icon the virus that causes COVID-19.

In most instances, a single case of COVID-19 in a school would not warrant closing the entire school. Community spread and how much contact the person with COVID-19 had with others, as well as when such contact took place, need to be considered. These variables should also be considered when determining how long a school, or part of the school, stays closed. Administrators should work with local health officials to determine if temporarily closing the school building is necessary.

Hand hygiene: promoting it in your school

The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19, which is thought to spread mainly from person to person. Another key preventive action you can take is to regularly clean hands. Cleaning hands at key times with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not readily available is one of the most important steps a person can take to avoid getting sick. This helps prevent a variety of infections because:

People frequently touch their eyes, nose, and mouth without even realizing it. Germs can get into the body through the mouth, nose, and eyes and make us sick.

Germs from unwashed hands can be transferred to other objects, like handrails, tabletops, or keyboards, and then be transferred to another person’s hands.

Removing germs through handwashing therefore helps prevent diarrhea and respiratory infections and may even help prevent skin and eye infections.

Teaching people about handwashing helps them and their communities stay healthy. Handwashing can reduce respiratory illnesses, like colds, in the general population by up to 21%. Additionally, school-based programs promoting handwashing and hand hygiene can result in less gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses and fewer missed school days.

For more information, see CDC’s Handwashing: Clean Hands Save Lives website.

Establishing a culture of hand hygiene

Teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among teachers, students, and staff.

Using hand sanitizers to reduce germs on hands

Use hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available

CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water because handwashing reduces the amounts of all types of germs and chemicals on hands. But if soap and water are not available, using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can help you avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others.

Soap and water remove all types of germs from hands, while sanitizer acts by killing certain germs on the skin. Although alcohol-based hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of germs in many situations, they should be used in the right situations.

When using hand sanitizer, apply the product to the palm of one hand (read the label to learn the correct amount) and rub the product all over the surfaces of your hands until your hands are dry.

Hand sanitizers are less effective than handwashing in some situations

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers kill the virus that causes COVID-19 when used correctly. However, hand sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including some germs that cause diarrhea. Always wash hands with soap and water after using the toilet.

Hand sanitizers may not be as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy. Hands are often dirty or greasy after activities like eating or playing outside.

Hand sanitizers might not remove harmful chemicals, like pesticides and heavy metals, from hands.",##########,
Interim Guidance for Case Investigation and Contact Tracing in K-12 Schools,"Overview

To promote safe and healthy learning environments in K-12 schools, school administrators can work together with health departments to reduce the risk of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019). K-12 school administrators can play an important role in taking steps to slow the spread of disease to prevent outbreaks, and protect students, staff and teachers. Regardless of the level of community transmission, K-12 schools should be prepared for COVID-19 outbreaks in their communities that may introduce infection to the school setting, identification of cases among students, staff and teachers, and potential exposure(s) to COVID-19 that may occur at school facilities or events.

Operating schools during COVID-19: CDC’s Considerations provides guidance to assist K-12 school administrators in planning a comprehensive response. Case investigation and contact tracing are essential interventionspdf iconexternal icon in a successful, multipronged response to COVID-19, and should be implemented along with other mitigation strategies. As K-12 schools resume in-person learning, case investigation and contact tracing with staff, teachers and students should be anticipated as a crucial strategy to reduce further transmission once a case is identified. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages collaboration between K-12 schools and state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) health departments when investigating cases and exposures to infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Prompt and coordinated actions, including case investigation and contact tracing, may inform decision-making about strengthening, focusing, and relaxing mitigation strategies. This document aims to highlight potential collaboration between health officials and K-12 school administrators to facilitate effective case investigation and contact tracing.

Who this guidance is for: Administrators of public and private K-12 schools coordinating case investigations and contact tracing in schools, in order to inform policy development and program implementation. This document may also be informative for public health professionals coordinating K-12 school case investigations and contact tracing.

Background

COVID-19 is a nationally notifiable disease . When diagnosed or identified through laboratory or clinical criteria, COVID-19 cases are required to be reported, by healthcare providers and laboratories, to state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) health departments. When laboratories send positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 to health departments, many of these test results are received via electronic laboratory report. Testing locations, such as pharmacies and community testing sites, are also required to report positive test results to the health department for follow-up. Health care providers from a variety of clinical settings, including K-12 school-based clinics and community-based settings, also complete case reports on symptomatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Health departments have primary responsibility for case investigation and contact tracing. Case investigation and contact tracing are, core disease control measures employed by STLT health department personnel for decades, and an important part of the COVID-19 response.

Case investigation is the process of working with a person (patient) who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 to discuss their test result or diagnosis, assess their symptom history and health status, and provide instructions and support for self-isolation and symptom monitoring. This interaction is the first step to review the activity history of the person diagnosed with COVID-19, while infectious, and identify people (contacts) who may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Contact tracing is the process of notifying people (contacts) of their potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, provide information about the virus, and discuss their symptom history and other relevant health information. In addition, instructions for self-quarantine and monitoring for symptoms, and support and referrals to testing, clinical services, and other essential support services are provided, as indicated.

The case investigation and contact tracing processes help to prevent further transmission of disease by separating people who have (or may have) an infectious disease from people who do not. Prompt identification, voluntary self-quarantine, and monitoring of those contacts exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can effectively break the chain of transmission and prevent further spread of the virus in a community.

Classification of an individual as a close contact is based on many factors and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In the context of COVID-19, the definition of a close contact is someone who was within 6 feet of a person diagnosed with COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more. More information to inform the determination of exposure risk can be found, on CDC’s Public Health Guidance for Community-Related Exposure. This information further notes that: 1) data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Factors to consider when defining close contact include proximity, the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), and whether the exposure was from a person with symptoms (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). Furthermore, while research indicates masks may help keep those who are infected from spreading the infection, there is less information regarding how much protection masks offer a contact exposed to a symptomatic or asymptomatic patient. Therefore, the determination of close contact should be made irrespective of whether the person with COVID-19 or the contact was wearing a mask. 2) Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure. Recommendations vary on the length of time of exposure, but a total of 15 minutes or more close exposure can be used as an operational definition. Brief interactions are less likely to result in transmission; however, symptoms and the type of interaction (e.g., whether the infected person coughed directly into the face of the exposed individual) remain important. Assessment of exposure beyond close contact is a recommended strategy in some K-12 school and IHE settings to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause symptomatic illness and asymptomatic infection among young and healthy populations. K-12 schools may be a potential source of COVID-19 outbreaks, due to the number of individuals intermingling in close proximity for extended periods of time. K-12 school settings contain a mixed population of students, staff, and teachers, ranging from young children to older adults, who can be highly interconnected in multiple, close-contact networks such as classrooms, libraries, theatres, gymnasiums, social meal events, sports teams, clubs, dormitories, and transportation. Some studies show that transmission from young children may be limited, [ 1 ] but more data are needed as some countries have observed widespread disease transmission in primary schools. [ 2 ] A priority consideration for when an outbreak of COVID-19 is identified in a K-12 school is the subsequent exposure/transmission to other members of a school community, such as “older and/or more vulnerable individuals (e.g., teachers, school workers, volunteers, grandparents, or immunocompromised children or adults) who are in proximity to school children.” [ 3 ] In some instances, students may live in multigenerational households or have parents, guardians or caretakers with underlying health conditions, which may increase their risk for severe illness from COVID-19. These close settings, as well as close contact activities such as certain sports, may cause the K-12 school population and more broadly at-risk family members and caretakers to be at increased risk of transmission of the virus.

Health departments are responsible for leading case investigations, contact tracing, and outbreak investigations. Case investigation and contact tracing in response to COVID-19 transcends standard practice. Throughout the country, health departments are scaling up case investigation and contact tracing programs by using different staffing models and technology supports. Given the large number of COVID-19 cases reported to health departments, coupled with how easily and quickly SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, health department resources can be overwhelmed. Multisector partnerships can be an asset to expand the reach and timeliness of case investigation and contact tracing, thus facilitating prompt isolation and quarantine of cases and contacts. Partnerships between health departments and K-12 schools are encouraged as they may help to limit the spread of COVID-19, in these settings and local communities.",##########,
COVID-19: K-12 Schools and Childcare Programs,"First, students with symptoms of COVID-19 should not attend school. Symptoms of asthma and COVID-19 may overlap, including cough and shortness of breath. Therefore, students experiencing acute asthma attacks should not be attending school without approval by a healthcare provider; if an asthma attack starts at school, a student may need a bronchodilator treatment before being sent home or before an ambulance arrives. The American Lung Association’s Model Policy for School Districts: Stock Bronchodilatorspdf iconexternal icon recommends using inhalers with disposable spacers/mouthpieces and nebulizers with disposable tubing with mask/mouthpieces. Inhalers and nebulizers should be used and cleaned according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

During this COVID-19 pandemic, asthma treatments using inhalers with spacers (with or without face mask, according to each student’s individualized treatment plan) are preferred over nebulizer treatments whenever possible. Based on limited data, use of asthma inhalers (with or without spacers or face masks) is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure.

Due to limited availability of data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated by nebulizer treatments are potentially infectious.1 During this COVID-19 pandemic, nebulizer treatments at school should be reserved for children who cannot use or do not have access to an inhaler (with or without spacer or face mask).

Use of peak flow meters, including in the school setting, includes forceful exhalation. Based on limited available data1, forceful exhalation is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure associated with increased risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19. However, for some people with asthma, using a peak flow meter can trigger cough.

Schools should obtain the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff who administer nebulizer treatments and peak flow meters to students with asthma. PPE for use when administering nebulizer treatments or peak flow meters to students with asthma consists of gloves, medical or surgical facemask and eye protection. School staff should be trained on when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, where this PPE is stored, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of used PPE. CDC has information on using PPE. Staff should also be trained on how to administer nebulizer treatments and peak flow meters.

During this COVID-19 pandemic, if a nebulizer treatment or use of peak flow meter is necessary at school for a student, the number of people present in the room should be limited to the student and the staff member administering the treatment or peak flow meter. If appropriate based on the student’s age and level of maturity, the staff member could leave the room and return when the nebulizer treatment is finished. After the nebulizer treatment or use of peak flow meter, this room should undergo routine cleaning and disinfection. CDC has information on how to clean and disinfect and how to prevent asthma attacks triggered by cleaning and disinfecting activities.

People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19. CDC has more information on COVID-19 for schools and healthcare providers (including school nurses).

Overview

To promote safe and healthy learning environments in Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), IHE administrators can work together with health departments to reduce the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). IHE administrators play an important role by taking steps to slow the spread of disease to prevent outbreaks, and protect students, staff, and faculty.

Interim Guidance for Administrators of U.S. Institutions of Higher Education provides guidance to assist IHE administrators in planning a comprehensive response. Many IHEs are adopting approaches to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, transmission on campus. These approaches include increased social distancing in classrooms and dining halls, requirements for face masks, reducing density of on-campus housing, and various testing strategies. However, off-campus community settings including apartments, bars and restaurants, and community spaces related to campus (e.g., communities of faith, Greek organizations, athletic events, other mass gatherings) can also pose a risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These off-campus settings should also be considered in case investigation and contract tracing efforts.

Case investigation and contact tracing are essential interventions pdf icon[9.9 MB, 20 Pages]external icon in a successful, multipronged response to COVID-19, and should be implemented along with other mitigation strategies.

These close settings, as well as close contact activities such as certain sports, may cause the IHE population to be at increased risk of transmission of the virus. In addition, many campuses host child-care centers, operate retail centers or have venues open to the general population. COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported from IHEs that extended beyond students, to include household and community contacts.1 Additionally, modeling studies have estimated that new cases of COVID-19 increase more quickly within a residential IHE setting than in the general population.2 Close-contact residential settings (on-campus and off-campus), large group classes in closed indoor settings, and frequent small-group interactions, have been modeled to demonstrate that multiple, short chains of infection can increase the likelihood of virus spread. 3 As a result of this close-contact network, it is important to use case investigation and contact tracing to rapidly identify persons who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, those who have been exposed to the virus, and those who may be at risk for possible exposure. This identification process is necessary to mitigate transmission and prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Youth Sports Program FAQs,"Sports that require close interaction, are played indoors, and share equipment may pose a greater risk for COVID-19 infection or transmission. The virus spreads mainly from person-to-person among other ways. The more people a player or coach interacts with, the closer the physical interaction, the more sharing of equipment there is by multiple players, and the longer the interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.

To determine which sports are safer to play during the COVID-19 pandemic, consider the following:

Physical closeness of players during play

Amount of necessary touching of shared equipment and gear

Ability to engage in social distancing while not actively engaged in play such as when on the bench or sideline

Age of the player and their ability to comply with social distancing and other protective actions

Size of the team and field of play

Presence of nonessential visitors, spectators, volunteers during practices or games

Travel required outside of the local community

Sports that require frequent closeness or contact between players may make it more difficult to maintain social distancing and therefore may present increased risk for COVID-19 spread. For close-contact sports like wrestling or basketball, play may be modified to safely increase distance between players.

For example: Coaches and players can focus on individual skill building or conditioning instead of competition; Coaches can limit close or full contact (such as tackling, checking or guarding) to competitions or game-like situations (such as scrimmages) or limit the number of participants involved in close or full contact situations; Leagues can decrease the number of competitions during a season.



For sports that are normally played indoors such as hockey and gymnastics, coaches can focus on individual skill building or conditioning in lieu of team-based practice, limit the number of players or athletes in the facility at one time so they can space out by at least 6 feet, or conduct modified practices outdoors.",##########,
Considerations for Community-Based Organizations,"As some community-based organizations (CBOs) begin to resume or increase their level of activities, CDC offers the following considerations for ways these organizations can help protect individuals and communities and slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CBOs can play a vital role in maintaining community morale and cohesion. They can also serve as a crucial link between communities and local health and other officials, providing insight about the feasibility and acceptability of proposed mitigation strategies and informing authorities about resources and needs in their communities.

CBOs work at the local level to meet community needs. They include social service agencies, nonprofit organizations, and formal and informal community groups, like neighborhood groups or recreational or special-interest clubs. Depending on the nature of their work, a CBO’s stakeholders may include volunteers, members, clients, supporters, patrons, program participants, and event attendees.

These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which organizations must comply. CBOs can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. CBOs should continually assess, based on current conditions, how to modify their operations and programming to both advance their mission and protect their staff and stakeholders.

CBOs may also benefit from reviewing CDC’s COVID-19 information focused on workplaces, events and gatherings, food service providers, youth sports, youth and summer camps, childcare programs, and people at higher risk of severe illness.

Guiding Principles to Keep in Mind

The more people an individual interacts with, and the longer that interaction lasts, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. Location can be a factor, too, with outdoor activities generally being less risky than indoor activities. The risk of COVID-19 spread increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Meetings and other activities are conducted virtually. Only essential activities (i.e., provision of essential services) occur in person. More risk: Small, in-person gatherings like board meetings or support groups are held. Outdoor activities and meetings are prioritized. Individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and do not share objects. No food is served at meetings or events. Most staff telework and if staff or stakeholders are present in a facility, they are required to wear masks (if able) and maintain social distancing. Rigorous cleaning and disinfecting practices are implemented. Attendees at the organization’s meeting and events come from the same local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, county). Higher risk: Indoor activities are held. Medium-sized in-person gatherings are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart. In CBO facilities, common areas are closed, and staff are encouraged to wear masks (if able) and maintain social distancing. Food is served in pre-packaged boxes with disposable utensils to eliminate the need for shared items or congregating around serving tables. For meetings and events, a limited number of attendees come from outside the local geographic area. Highest risk: Standard operations and programming are resumed. Large in-person gatherings are held where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart. Food is served “potluck” or family style. Many event attendees come from outside the local geographic area.

Targeting COVID-19’s Spread

The virus that causes COVID-19 is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people cough, sneeze, or talk. Someone can also get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own nose, mouth, or possibly their eyes. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as staying home when sick, social distancing, wearing a mask, and handwashing) and environmental prevention practices (such as cleaning and disinfection) are important ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

These prevention principles are covered in this document. They provide CBOs with actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during sponsored activities.

Promoting Healthy Behaviors that Reduce Spread of COVID-19

CBOs should consider implementing strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Hand Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette Require frequent employee handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence. If soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol can be used; rub hands together until dry. Encourage staff to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Encourage alternate forms of greeting besides handshakes, hugs, and kissing. For example, introduce a new practice of waving or bowing. Encourage clients and others coming to your office or attending events to engage in these same practices.



Masks Require the use of masks among staff and volunteers, as feasible. Masks are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult. Information should be provided to all staff and volunteers on proper use, removal, and washing of masks. Note: Masks should not be placed on: Babies or children younger than 2 years old Anyone who has trouble breathing Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer may have the virus and not know it. Masks are not meant to be a substitute for personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, respirators, or other medical personal protective equipment. Encourage clients and other stakeholders coming to your facility or attending events to bring and use masks .



Adequate Supplies Ensure you have accessible sinks and enough supplies available for staff, facility visitors, and attendees to clean their hands and cover their coughs and sneezes at all events. Supplies include soap, water, a way to dry hands (e.g., paper towels, hand dryer), tissues, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans (preferably covered).



Maintaining Healthy Environments

CBOs should consider implementing strategies to maintain healthy environments.

Restrooms Consider limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time to allow for social distancing. If lines form near the restroom, ensure people remain at least 6 feet from each other. Ensure that restrooms are: Cleaned and disinfected regularly, particularly high-touch surfaces such as faucets, toilets, doorknobs, and light switches. Clean and disinfect restrooms daily or more often, if possible, and use EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19 pdf icon . Regularly stocked with supplies for handwashing, including soap, water, and disposable paper towels or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid supplying reusable towels. Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep products away from children.



Ventilation Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling or triggering asthma symptoms).



Water Systems To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated with stagnant water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized, but encourage people working in or visiting your facility to bring their own water, as feasible, to minimize use and touching of water fountains.



Physical Barriers and Guides Provide physical guides (e.g., guides for creating “one-way routes”), such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times. Install physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart. Barriers can be useful at reception areas, distribution counters, and other areas where remaining at least 6 feet apart is difficult.



Communal Spaces Use methods to physically separate employees in all areas of the facilities including work areas and other areas such as meeting rooms, break rooms, parking lots, entrance and exit areas, and locker rooms; otherwise, stagger use and clean and disinfect between use. Arrange reception or other communal seating area chairs by turning, draping (covering chair with tape or fabric so seats cannot be used), spacing, or removing chairs to maintain social distancing.



Food Service There is no evidence that people can get COVID-19 from eating food. However, sharing utensils and congregating around food service areas may present risks. If food is offered at any meeting or event, have individual, pre-packaged boxes or bags instead of a potluck, buffet, or family-style meal. Avoid sharing of foods and utensils. If the organization hosts an event that includes food service, refer to CDC’s COVID-19 considerations for restaurants and bars. Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals not from the same household remain at least 6 feet apart when waiting in line to order or pick up. Use disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, dishes). If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.



Shared Objects Discourage people from sharing items that are difficult to clean, sanitize, or disinfect in between use, such as food containers, tools, equipment, or supplies. Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials to the extent possible; otherwise, limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of people at a time and clean and disinfect between use.



Maintaining Healthy Operations

CBOs should consider implementing strategies to maintain healthy operations.

Regulatory Awareness Be aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.



Participation in Community Response Efforts Consider participating with local authorities in broader COVID-19 community response efforts (e.g., sitting on community response committees) and collaborating with other CBOs to coordinate activities or limit duplication of efforts, where possible. Inform local authorities about areas of concern or previously unknown issues as well as community or organizational resources that might be helpful in responding to changing circumstances in the community.



Flexible and Responsive Operations and Communication Plans Define roles, responsibilities, and decision-making protocols so that the organization can adjust operations, services, and programming in response to changing community conditions. Develop a communication plan to alert stakeholders to changes in operations and ensure that contact information is up to date. Develop information-sharing systems with partners, including local health officials.



Designated COVID-19 Point of Contact Designate a staff person to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All staff and stakeholders should know who this person is and how to contact them.



Protections for Staff and Others who are at Higher Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19 Offer options that limit exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities) for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions). As feasible, offer options that limit the COVID-19 exposure risk (e.g., virtual attendance) for stakeholders who are at higher risk for severe illness. Replace in-person meetings with video- or tele-conference calls whenever possible. Limit event attendance to staff and attendees who live in the local geographic area (e.g., community, city, town, county) to reduce risk of spread from areas with higher levels of COVID-19. Put in place policies that protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding their underlying medical conditions.



Social Distancing and Modifying Layouts Reconfigure office spaces, waiting or meeting rooms, break rooms, conference rooms, or similar areas to allow for at least 6 feet between people. In situations where people will form lines, encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by providing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks. Limit attendance at events to allow for social distancing, or host smaller events in larger rooms. Prioritize outdoor activities where attendees can remain at least 6 feet from others not living in their household. If distributing items like food or supplies, consider using drive-up distribution so that people can maintain distance from each other and to eliminate the need to touch doorknobs and other items and surfaces in a facility. Consider temporarily suspending singing, chanting, or shouting during events especially when participants are in close proximity to each other. If attendees choose to sing, chant, or shout, encourage them to wear masks and increase distance between people to greater than 6 feet.



Meetings, Gatherings, and Performances Pursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings, if possible, and promote social distancing of at least 6 feet between people if in-person events are held. Limit group size to the extent possible. Prioritize outdoor activities where attendees can remain at least 6 feet from others not living in their household. When planning events, consult CDC’s Considerations for Gatherings and Community Events. Limit any nonessential visitors, spectators, and volunteers at events. Limit activities involving external groups or organizations as much as possible – especially with individuals not from the local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, or county). Consider temporarily suspending musical performances that involve singing or playing wind instruments. If such events are held, musicians should be spaced as far apart as feasible, ideally farther than 6 feet apart.



Childcare and Youth Programming If providing a nursery or childcare during meetings or events, refer to CDC’s information on preventing the spread of COVID-19 in childcare settings. If holding summer day camps, refer to CDC’s information on youth and summer camps.



Identifying Small Groups and Keeping Them Together (Cohorting) Ensure that groupings of staff, volunteers, and program participants are as small and as static as possible. CBOs should consider: Scheduling staff and volunteers together in small groups (cohorts) so that they are always scheduled to work on the same days/times together, reducing their exposure risk. Ensuring attendees of regular events (e.g., support groups) are scheduled with the same group of attendees for each event so that individuals are in contact with the same people for each visit, and so that distinct groupings do not mix. Limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of people at a time and clean and disinfect between use.



Staggered Scheduling Stagger arrival times or locations for meetings and events. Use flexible worksites (e.g., telework) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing of at least 6 feet between employees, volunteers, and others.



Transportation For employees who commute to work using public transportation or ride sharing, encourage them to use transportation options that minimize close contact with others (e.g., walking or biking, driving or riding by car – alone or with household members only) or consider offering the following support: Ask employees to follow the CDC guidance on how to Protect Yourself When Using Transportation, including public transit. Allow employees to shift their hours so they can commute during less busy times. Ask employees to maintain social distance when possible, wear a mask if able, and wash their hands as soon as possible when they arrive to work.



Where possible, avoid activities that require shared transportation vehicles. If using shared transportation vehicles like vans or buses, clean and disinfect them according to the guidance for bus transit operators or drivers for hire. Ensure that drivers and passengers wear masks, if they are able; remain about 6 feet apart, as feasible; and wash their hands as soon as possible after the trip.



Communication Systems Put systems in place to: Encourage staff and stakeholders who come to your facility or attend events sponsored by your organization to self-report to the designated COVID-19 point of contact if they have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19 external icon (e.g., see “Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts” in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below), and other applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations. Notify staff and stakeholders of cancellations and restrictions in place to limit exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., limited hours of operation). Identify and address potential language, cultural, and environmental barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to organization staff and stakeholders. Tailor information so that it is easily understood by various audiences and is available in a variety of languages and formats. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures by visiting: Know Your Audience. You can also, learn more about communicating to staff in a crisis at Crisis Communications.

Leave (Time Off) Policies Implement flexible sick leave policies and practices that are not punitive and that enable employees to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, are caring for someone who is sick, or who must stay home with children if schools or childcare centers are closed. Examine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation as needed. Ensure employees are aware of these policies.







Back-Up Staffing Plan Monitor absenteeism of employees and critical volunteers, cross-train staff and volunteers, and create a roster of trained back-up staff and volunteers. Develop policies for employees and volunteers to return to their duties and the facility after having COVID-19. CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.



Staff Training Train staff on all safety protocols. Use CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers as a guide. Conduct training virtually or ensure that participants maintain social distancing during training. As volunteers often perform important duties, consider similar monitoring, planning, and training for them. Consider that volunteer and staffing levels may need to increase to implement cleaning and safety protocols.



Close Contact CBO staff or volunteers who have close contact (within 6 feet) with clients (e.g., people who visit client homes) should take extra precautions. CBOs should consult with local public health officials and occupational safety and health professionals to decide whether staff or volunteers should wear any form of personal protective equipment rather than or in addition to a mask. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Masks are not meant to be a substitute for personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, respirators, or other medical personal protective equipment. Limit the amount of time staff or volunteers are in close contact (within 6 feet) with others, to the extent feasible. Maintain a supply of masks for clients to wear (if able) and provide guidance on how to wear them properly. Remind clients to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Proper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure. Ensure employees and volunteers wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, provide an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. Key times to clean hands in general include: Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating food After using the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing Before entering a client’s home and upon leaving After touching frequently touched surfaces After putting on, touching, or removing masks Employees and volunteers should avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.



Recognize Signs and Symptoms If feasible, conduct daily health checks (e.g., temperature screening and/or symptom checking) of staff, volunteers, and others who come to your facility or attend your events safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. CBOs should consider using examples of screening methods in CDC’s General Business FAQs as a guide.



Sharing Facilities Encourage any organizations that share or use your facility to also follow these considerations. Limit shared facility use, if possible.



Support Coping and Resilience Promote employees’ ability to eat healthy foods, exercise, get enough sleep, and find time to unwind. Encourage employees and others to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling. Consider posting signs for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746; the National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 and TTY 1-800-787-3224; and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255).



Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick

CBOs should consider strategies to implement when someone gets sick.

Advise Sick Individuals of Home Isolation Criteria Communicate to sick staff members that they should not return to work until they have met CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation. Similarly, communicate to volunteers and others who come to your facility or events that they should stay away until they have met CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation.



Isolate and Transport Those Who are Sick Make sure that staff and others at your facility or event know that they should not come to the facility or event, and that they should notify the designated COVID-19 point of contact if they become sick with COVID-19 symptoms, test positive for COVID-19, or have been exposed to someone with symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case. Immediately separate anyone with COVID-19 symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, shortness of breath). People who are sick should go home or to a healthcare facility, depending on how severe their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for themselves. Anyone who has had close contact with a person who has symptoms should be separated, sent home, and advised to follow CDC guidance for community-related exposure (see “Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts” below). If symptoms develop, individuals should follow CDC guidance for caring for themselves. Identify an isolation area(s) to separate anyone who has COVID-19 symptoms or who has tested positive but does not have symptoms. Establish procedures for safely transporting anyone who becomes sick to their home or to a healthcare facility. If you are calling an ambulance or bringing someone to the hospital, try to call first to alert them that the person may have COVID-19.

Considerations for Events and Gatherings,"As some communities in the United States begin to plan and hold events and gatherings, the CDC offers the following considerations for enhancing protection of individuals and communities and preventing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Event planners and officials can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Because COVID-19 virus circulation varies in communities, these considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which gatherings must comply. Organizers should continue to assess, based on current conditions, whether to postpone, cancel, or significantly reduce the number of attendees for gatherings.

After reviewing the considerations listed on this page, event planners and administrators can use CDC’s Events and Gatherings Readiness and Planning Tool pdf icon[9 pages] to protect staff, volunteers, and attendees.

Guiding Principles

A gathering refers to a planned or spontaneous event, indoors or outdoors, with a small number of people participating or a large number of people in attendance such as a community event or gathering, concert, festival, conference, parade, wedding, or sporting event.

The more people an individual interacts with at a gathering and the longer that interaction lasts, the higher the potential risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and COVID-19 spreading.

The higher the level of community transmission in the area that the gathering is being held, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spreading during a gathering.

The size of an event or gathering should be determined based on state, local, territorial or tribal safety laws and regulations.

The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings. More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear masks, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county). Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area. Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.

Targeting COVID-19’s spread

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is thought to be mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It is thought that the virus may also spread to hands from a contaminated surface and then to the nose, mouth or eyes, causing infection. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as handwashing, staying home when sick, maintaining 6 feet of distance, and wearing a mask) and environmental prevention practices (such as cleaning and disinfection) are important ways to prevent the virus’s spread.

These prevention principles are covered in this document. They provide event planners and individuals with actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during gatherings and events.

Promoting Healthy Behaviors that Reduce Spread

Event planners should consider implementing strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19 among staff and attendees.

Hand Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette Require frequent employee handwashing (e.g., before, during, and after taking tickets; after touching garbage) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence. If soap and water are not readily available, employees can use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol and rub their hands until dry. Encourage staff to cover the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Encourage attendees to wash hands often and cover coughs and sneezes. Attendees often exchange handshakes, fist bumps, and high-fives at meetings and sporting events. Display signs (physical and/or electronic) that discourage these actions during the event.



Masks Require the use of masks among staff. Masks are most essential in times when physical distancing is difficult (e.g., when moving within a crowd or audience). Provide all staff with information on proper use, removal, and washing of masks. Advise staff that masks should not be placed on: Babies or children younger than 2 years old Anyone who has trouble breathing Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance Encourage attendees ahead of the event to bring and use masks at the event. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Masks are not meant to be a substitute for personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, respirators, or other medical personal protective equipment. Masks are strongly encouraged in settings where individuals might raise their voice (e.g., shouting, chanting, singing).



Adequate Supplies Ensure you have accessible sinks and enough supplies for people to clean their hands and cover their coughs and sneezes. Supplies include soap, water, a way to dry hands (e.g., paper towels, hand dryer), tissues, hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans (preferably covered).



Maintaining Healthy Environments

Event planners should consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy environments.

Cleaning and Disinfection Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces within the venue at least daily or between uses as much as possible—for example, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains, grab bars, hand railings, and cash registers. Clean and disinfect shared objects between uses—for example, payment terminals, tables, countertops, bars, and condiment holders. Consider closing areas such as drinking fountains that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected during an event. Develop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection. Plan for and enact these cleaning routines when renting event space and ensure that other groups who may use your facilities follow these routines. If transport vehicles like buses are used by the event staff, drivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff—for example, washing hands often and wearing masks and maintaining social distance of bus riders. To clean and disinfect event buses, vans, or other vehicles see guidance for bus transit operators and drivers for hire, and adapt as needed. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaners and disinfectants external icon to avoid harm to employees and other individuals. Always read and follow label instructions for each product, and store products securely away from children. Use EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19 external icon . Cleaning products should not be used near children. Staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent attendees or themselves from inhaling toxic vapors. Use disposable gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash. After using disposable gloves, throw them out in a lined trash can. Do not disinfect or reuse the gloves. Wash hands after removing gloves.



Restrooms Consider limiting the number of people who occupy the restroom at one time to allow for social distancing. Do not allow lines or crowds to form near the restroom without maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from other people. It may be helpful to post signs or markers to help attendees maintain the appropriate social distance of at least 6 feet. Ensure that open restrooms are: Operational with functional toilets. Cleaned and disinfected regularly, particularly high-touch surfaces such as faucets, toilets, stall doors, doorknobs, countertops, diaper changing tables, and light switches. Clean and disinfect restrooms daily or more often, if possible, with EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19. Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep products away from children. Stocked with enough supplies for handwashing, including soap and water, a way to dry hands (e.g., paper towels, hand dryer), tissues, hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), tissues, and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans (preferably covered). If you are providing portable toilets, also provide portable handwashing stations and ensure that they remain stocked throughout the duration of the event. If possible, provide hand sanitizer stations that are touch-free.



Ventilation Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example, by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk to staff or attendees (e.g., risk of falling or triggering asthma symptoms). If portable ventilation equipment like fans are used, take steps to minimize air from them blowing from one person directly at another person to reduce the potential spread of any airborne or aerosolized viruses.



Water Systems

To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized, but encourage staff and attendees to bring their own water, as feasible, to minimize touching and use of water fountains.



Modified Layouts Limit attendance or seating capacity to allow for social distancing, or host smaller events in larger rooms. Use multiple entrances and exits and discourage crowded waiting areas. Block off rows or sections of seating in order to space people at least 6 feet apart. Eliminate lines or queues if possible or encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by providing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks. Prioritize outdoor activities where social distancing can be maintained as much as possible. Offer online attendance options in addition to in-person attendance to help reduce the number of attendees.



Physical Barriers and Guides Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (e.g., guides for creating one-way routes). Install physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart. Barriers can be useful at cash registers and other areas where maintaining physical distance of 6 feet is difficult. Change seating layout or availability of seating so that people can remain least 6 feet apart.



Communal Spaces Stagger use of shared indoor spaces such as dining halls, game rooms, and lounges as much as possible and clean and disinfect them between uses. Add physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks and beds, especially when they cannot be at least 6 feet apart. Clean and disinfect bathrooms regularly (e.g., in the morning and evening or after times of heavy use) using EPA-registered disinfectants external icon . For more information on communal spaces in event housing (e.g., laundry rooms, shared bathrooms, and recreation areas) follow CDC’s guidance for Shared or Congregate Housing.



Food Service There is no evidence that COVID-19 is spread by food. However, people sharing utensils and congregating around food service areas can pose a risk. If the event includes food service, refer to CDC’s COVID-19 considerations for restaurants and bars . Use touchless payment options as much as possible, if available. Ask customers and employees to exchange cash or card payments by placing them on a receipt tray or on the counter rather than by hand to avoid direct hand-to-hand contact. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as pens, counters, or hard surfaces between use and encourage patrons to use their own pens. Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart when waiting in line to order or pick up. If a cafeteria or group dining room is used, serve individually plated meals or grab-and-go options, and hold activities in separate areas. Use disposable food service items including utensils and dishes. If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items. Avoid offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as buffets, salad bars, and drink stations. Consider having pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee.



Shared Objects Discourage people from sharing items that are difficult to clean, sanitize, or disinfect. Limit any sharing of food, tools, equipment, or supplies by staff members. Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials to the extent possible; otherwise, limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of staff members or attendees at a time, and clean and disinfect them between use.



Maintaining Healthy Operations

Event organizers and staff may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy operations.

Regulatory Awareness Be aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.



Protections for Staff and Attendees who are at Higher Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19 Offer options for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of any age with underlying medical conditions) that limit their exposure risk. For example: Offer telework and modified job responsibilities for staff, such as setting up for the event rather than working at the registration desk. Replace in-person meetings with video- or tele-conference calls whenever possible. As feasible, offer options for attendees at higher risk for severe illness that limit their exposure risk (e.g., virtual attendance). Consider limiting event attendance to staff and guests who live in the local area (e.g., community, city, town, or county) to reduce risk of spreading the virus from areas with higher levels of COVID-19. If attendance is open to staff and guests from other communities, cities, town or counties, provide information to attendees so they can make an informed decision about participation. Put policies in place to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding their underlying medical conditions.



Limited, Staggered, or Rotated Shifts and Attendance Times

Consider ways to significantly reduce the number of attendees. Use flexible worksites (e.g., telework) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing of 6 feet between employees, volunteers, and others. Rotate or stagger shifts and arrival times to limit the number of employees in a venue at the same time. Stagger and limit attendance times to minimize the number of guests at the venue.



Travel & Transit Encourage employees to use transportation options that minimize close contact with others (e.g., walking or biking, driving or riding by car – alone or with household members only). Consider offering the following support: Ask employees to follow the CDC guidance on how to Protect Yourself When Using Transportation, including public transit. Allow employees to shift their hours so they can commute during less busy times. Ask employees to wash their hands as soon as possible after their trip.



Reconfigure parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper separation of employees (e.g., closing every other parking space). Encourage rideshare drivers to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in the vehicle and avoid providing pooled rides or picking up multiple passengers who would not otherwise be riding together on the same route.



Designated COVID-19 Point of Contact Designate an administrator or office to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All staff and attendees should know who this person or office is and how to contact them.



Communication Systems Put systems in place to: Encourage staff and attendees to self-report to event officials or a COVID-19 point of contact if they have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days, in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19 (e.g., see “Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts” in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below ), and other applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations. Advise attendees prior to the event or gathering that they should not attend if they have symptoms of, a positive test for, or were recently exposed (within 14 days) to COVID-19. Notify staff, attendees, and the public of cancellations and restrictions in place to limit people’s exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., limited hours of operation). Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to event staff and participants. Tailor information so that it is easily understood by various audiences and is available in alternative formats and languages. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures by visiting: Know Your Audience. You also can learn more about communicating to staff in a crisis at: Crisis Communications Plan. external icon



Leave (Time Off) Policies Implement flexible sick leave policies and practices that are not punitive and enable employees to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, are caring for someone who is sick, or who must stay home with children if schools or child care centers are closed. Examine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation as needed. Ensure that any relevant policies are communicated to staff.



Back-Up Staffing Plan Monitor absenteeism of employees, cross-train staff, and create a roster of trained back-up staff. Develop policies for return-to-work and event facilities after an employee has COVID-19. CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.



Staff Training Train staff on all safety protocols. Consider using CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers as a guide. Conduct training virtually to ensure that social distancing is maintained during training. If training needs to be done in person, maintain social distancing. Virtual training is clearly better for infection control when feasible.



Recognize Signs and Symptoms If feasible, conduct daily health checks (e.g., temperature screening and/or symptom checking) of staff and attendees safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. Event administrators may consider using examples of screening methods in CDC’s General Business FAQs as a guide.



Sharing Facilities Encourage any organizations that share or use the same venue to also follow these considerations and limit shared use, if possible.



Support Coping and Resilience Promote employees’ ability to eat healthy foods, exercise, get enough sleep, and find time to unwind. Encourage employees to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling. Consider posting signs for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746; The National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 and TTY 1-800-787-3224; and The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255).



Lessons Learned After the Event Meet with the emergency operations coordinator or planning team for your venue to discuss and note lessons learned. Determine ways to improve planning and implementation processes if the event will happen again. Update your plans regularly according to the state and local situation and orders.



Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick

Event planners should consider several strategies to implement when someone gets sick.

Advise Sick Individuals of Home Isolation Criteria Communicate to sick staff members that they should not return to work until they have met CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation.



Clean and Disinfect Close off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting them (for outdoor areas, this includes surfaces or shared objects in the area, if applicable). Wait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning external icon and disinfection products, including storing them securely away from children.



Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts In accordance with state and local laws and regulations, event planners should notify local health officials, staff, and attendees of any case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) external icon and other applicable laws and regulations. Advise those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home, self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.

Considerations for Food Pantries and Food Distribution Sites,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges to food security across the U.S. Access to healthy food options and nutrition are important to overall physical and mental health and well-being. Food insecurity is expected to continue to increase for many households with more children not attending childcare and school in-person (a source of nutritious meals for many students) and with changes in employment status during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Find food and food system resources during COVID-19 for individuals seeking assistance, food assistance programs, and food system stakeholders.

Food pantries and food distribution sites provide donated food at no cost to people who have limited access and play an important role in communities. Community organizations often work with food pantries to provide food to families. Food pantries can have their own building, be in schools or churches, be mobile (e.g., in a truck), or distribute food in other ways, such as drive-through pickup distribution. Managers of food pantries and distribution sites should take special precautions to help staff, volunteers, and clients stay safe while continuing to prioritize the respect and dignity of clients.

Managers of food pantries and food distribution sites can consider these steps to help ensure safe access to food for their clients while helping prevent the spread of COVID-19. These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, tribal, local, and territorial health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which organizations must comply. Food pantry and distribution site managers can determine, in collaboration with state, tribal, local, and territorial health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community.

Planners and managers of food pantries and food distribution sites may also benefit from reviewing CDC’s COVID-19 guidance and considerations on community-based organizations, workplaces, events and gatherings, and grocery and food retail workers.

Planners and managers should review CDC’s information on people at increased risk for severe illness, employers with workers at high risk, and people experiencing homelessness. Extra precautions should be provided for staff, volunteers, and clients who may be at higher risk of severe illness or may be experiencing homelessness to protect them from exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.

Operational Considerations

Follow state, tribal, local, and territorial regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings and determine whether food distribution operations need to be adapted to continue client access to food resources while accommodating any such restrictions.

Determine the mode of food distribution to use based on local policies and local level of spread. Food pantry managers should continually assess how to modify their mode of food distribution (e.g., delivering to clients or using onsite pick-up) based on current levels of spread in each community they serve. Delivery of food items in ways that minimize in-person interactions are lower risk than onsite, indoor modes of distribution.

Consider expanding hours to help stagger the times that both staff/volunteers and clients are present at the facility.

Require all staff and volunteers to wash their hands before, after, and frequently during shifts and to wear masks, if feasible.

Consider regular symptom screenings of staff, volunteers, and clients who come onsite.

Include accessibility accommodations for people with disabilities if changes in set up or distribution mode or the context of COVID-19 presents new challenges. For example, ensure food products are stacked to a height reachable from a wheelchair in onsite pantries. Make sure signage about new protocols are adapted for lower literacy audiences and available in different languages spoken by clients served.

Select modes of distribution

Delivery

Based on the level of spread in your community and the safety and accessibility of transportation options, pre-packing and delivering food items to individuals and families may present the lowest risk of COVID-19 spread with greatest reach. This option is also best to serve clients who need to stay home because they are sick, have recently had contact with someone who is sick, or are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19. Establish a drop-off location (such as a doorstep) and time to deliver food without any physical contact, when clients will be available and able to bring food inside for proper storage right away. Try to include enough food variety and account for family size and any dietary or infant feeding needs and religious or cultural preferences. Include multiple days of food and, when possible, enough food for at least a week to help reduce the number of interactions needed. To promote healthy habits and nutritional education, consider adapting a choice model for the delivery mode. Distribute lists of options ahead of time and gather client selections over the phone prior to delivery, so that clients can receive their preferred food products.



Onsite distribution

If possible, distribute food outdoors.

If resources are available, consider having hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and masks (can be disposable as a more affordable option) at the entrance for clients to use upon entering.

Consider ways to schedule client times onsite to limit the number of people at any given time and to prevent crowds.

Modify the layout, as needed, to facilitate social distancing between staff, volunteers, and clients (maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet between people).

Consider providing a drive-through model in which clients can receive a box of food placed directly in their vehicle by staff or volunteers.

Choice pantries

Choice pantries are distribution sites that are set up like a grocery store. Clients come in and choose their food products while accompanied by a volunteer. While choice pantries are considered the best model for food pantries from a nutritional standpoint, special considerations should be made if COVID-19 is spreading in the community, and pantries should operate in accordance with local public health policies.

Use the same operational considerations (scheduling staggered shifts, mask protocols, setting up outside, etc.) as onsite distribution.

Because choice pantries are similar in design to grocery stores, managers, staff, and volunteers should consider CDC’s information for grocery store and food retail employees.

Cleaning and disinfection

Follow CDC Guidance on Cleaning and Disinfection to prepare and maintain a safe environment for workers and clients.

Encourage staying home when sick or recently had close contact with someone with COVID-19

*Consider modifications to provide clients who need to stay home because they are sick, recently had close contact with a person who is sick,or are at higher risk with food. Modifications could include providing delivery to these clients, if feasible/affordable, or allowing clients to designate other people who live outside of their home who can pick up food and deliver it to their home.

Plan for what to do if an employee, volunteer, or client who comes onsite becomes sick by referring to relevant sections in CDC’s Considerations for Community-Based Organizations.

Volunteer and Employee Safety

Train staff and volunteers on new procedures. If possible, conduct training virtually so all can attend without gathering together. Place signs and visual reminders about prevention steps around work areas, including markers for keeping at least 6 feet apart.

Require staff and volunteers to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water before, frequently during, and after shifts. Use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren’t available.

Provide a handwashing break every 2 hours and allow staff and volunteers to wash their hands more frequently if they choose.

Provide staff and volunteers disposable gloves since they may be exchanging or handling products from other people, unclean produce, or sharp edges on product packages. Remind staff and volunteers to avoid touching their face while wearing gloves and to wash their hands before putting gloves on and after taking them off.

Require staff and volunteers to wear masks, unless they have trouble breathing or are otherwise unable to remove a mask without assistance. Provide information to all staff and volunteers on proper use and washing of masks. Employers should bring extra masks each day in case masks get wet or soiled and a sealable plastic bag to store used masks.

Provide options, as possible, for employees and volunteers to work remotely, especially if they are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Tasks that might be done remotely include contacting clients over the phone for assessments and scheduling and working virtually with suppliers and donors.

Limit the number of staff, volunteers, and clients at assigned times so that at least 6 feet of distance can be maintained between people.

Client Outreach

Food insecurity, even in the short-term, can have serious impacts on physical and mental health. During this difficult time, food pantry and food distribution sites are critical. Managers can provide safe and flexible options to help people with food insecurity while prioritizing the health and safety of clients, staff, and volunteers.",##########,
Considerations for Outdoor Learning Gardens and Community Gardens,"These recommendations are intended for managers of outdoor learning gardens (e.g., school gardens) and community gardens. Outdoor learning gardens are often affiliated with schools and provide outdoor learning and access to healthy food for students. Community gardens are sections of land collectively gardened by a group of people to produce and share affordable fruits and vegetables within their communities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges across the United States. Access to healthy food options and nutrition are an important part of health and well-being. Outdoor learning and community gardens help fill nutritional gaps in places where access to healthy food may be limited, provide recreation and stress reduction opportunities, and provide a safe outdoor learning environment,external icon especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Garden managers should consider the recommendations below to help ensure a safe learning environment and access to healthy food, while helping prevent the spread of COVID-19.

These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which organizations must comply. Garden managers can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Garden managers should continually assess, based on current levels of spread in the community they serve, how to modify their garden operations.

Garden managers may also benefit from reviewing CDC’s COVID-19 guidance and considerations on community based organizations, workplaces, events and gatherings, food service providers, and CDC’s information on people at higher risk of severe illness .

Preventing the spread of COVID-19

Coronaviruses, such as the one that causes COVID-19, are thought to spread mostly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets emitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The droplets containing virus are spread in the air and can be inhaled in the lungs or land on the mouth, nose or eyes of people nearby. A person also might be exposed to the virus causing COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, including food or a shared tool, that has been contaminated when an infected person coughs or sneezes near it, and then touches their own mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Risk of transmission from food and shared tools is considered very low, but there are other, possible routes of COVID-19 spread, such as:

Being in close contact (within six feet) with others who do not live in the same household as you, especially people who do not wear masks. The more people you interact with, and the longer those interactions last, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread;

Contact with frequently touched surfaces (e.g., gate latches, hoses);

Touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your own mouth, nose, or eyes.

Outdoor activities generally are lower risk than indoor activities, but there are still important ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 that should be followed, including:

Promote healthy behaviors

Encourage people to stay at home when sick.

Staff, volunteers, and gardeners should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms , or have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of, or diagnosed with, COVID-19.

or have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of, or diagnosed with, COVID-19. Develop policies that encourage sick staff and volunteers to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure staff and volunteers are aware of these policies.

Educate staff and volunteers about when they should stay home and when it is safe to be around others.

Encourage people to socially distance.

Working at least six feet apart from others, even when you are outside, reduces the chance that you will be exposed to the virus from respiratory droplets emitted by others.

Many people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or no symptoms, but can still spread the virus to others. Staying apart reduces your risk of getting COVID-19.

Social distancing is most effective when it is used along with other prevention strategies, including wearing masks.

Masks

Require staff and volunteers to use masks, as feasible. Masks are an important means of reducing viral spread, and are essential when social distancing is difficult. Provide information to all staff and volunteers on proper use, removal, and washing of masks.

If feasible, provide masks for staff, volunteers, and gardeners, and consider asking them to bring extra masks, in case their mask gets wet or soiled, as well as a sealable plastic bag or other container to store masks when not in use.

Hand hygiene

Provide handwashing stations or hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol) for all gardeners, staff, and volunteers, if feasible. Ensure hand-hygiene options can be accessed by everyone.

Proper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure. Ensure employees and volunteers wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, provide an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. Hand sanitizers may not be as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy and might not remove harmful chemicals from hands like pesticides and heavy metals. Key times to clean hands in general include: Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating food After using the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing After touching frequently touched surfaces After putting on, touching, or removing masks After handling money After taking out the trash After gardening



Clear signage and communications

Ensure that all gardeners, staff, volunteers and the public are made aware of garden rules and hours. Post signs displaying hours of operation and safety precautions at each entrance to the garden and near shared areas and make the same information available on your website and social media platforms. Consider developing a communication plan that includes additional methods other than in-person or electronic communication only.

Post signs in highly visible locations (e.g., at building entrances, in restrooms) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread pdf icon of germs by properly washing hands and properly wearing a mask image icon .

of germs by properly washing hands and properly wearing a mask . Consider developing signs and messages in alternative formats (e.g., large print, Braille, American Sign Language) for people who have low vision or are blind or people who are deaf or hard of hearing or in other common languages spoken by members.

Maintain healthy environments

Modifications to promote social distancing should include:

Limiting the number of gardeners, staff, and volunteers at the garden to promote social distancing. Consider offering virtual education or other outreach activities to reduce crowding and extend garden opportunities for those who may not be able to physically visit the garden.

Encouraging all gardeners, staff, and volunteers to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from others, including in commonly shared spaces (e.g., handwashing stations).

Providing disinfecting wipes so that gardeners, staff and volunteers can wipe off tools between use.

Implementing one-way traffic flow in garden rows and other areas to promote social distancing, if possible.

Encouraging people to sign up in advance for community workdays or other events to decrease crowding.

Safe operations

Be aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to providing essential services and group gatherings to determine if your garden can be open to the public, and what rules apply, if any, regarding current restrictions limiting the number of attendees at events and/or shared spaces.

Limit non-essential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations, especially with those who are not from the local area, and consider what, if any, exceptions apply, such as allowing direct service providers or service animals that may assist people with disabilities.

Limit or suspend events or activities that target individuals identified as at higher risk for serious illness for COVID-19, and individuals who live with, or work with, people at increased risk, if feasible. If these events or activities continue to be offered, consider creating a schedule that includes special garden hours for at-risk or vulnerable populations.

Discourage people from eating and drinking in the garden and sharing food and beverages.

Cancel or postpone all taste-testing and cooking demo activities, if feasible.

Consider a regular training of staff, volunteers and gardeners so that they understand how COVID-19 is spread, how prevention strategies are helpful, and the specific prevention strategies that your garden has adopted and is promoting.

Consider regular symptom screenings of staff, volunteers and gardeners that come onsite, and have a plan for if anyone arrives or becomes ill. For guidance related to screening of staff, please refer to CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the “Prevent Transmission Among Employees” section of CDC’s Resuming Business Toolkit pdf icon .

. Ensure all water systems are safe to use, especially if re-opening garden facilities after a prolonged shut down.

Limit the use of traditional sign-up and sign-in sheets that require individuals to physically sign-in with a shared writing utensil. As feasible, use alternative methods, like phone calls or online scheduling platforms, to coordinate when staff, volunteers, and gardeners will be at the garden. If a shared writing utensil is used, ensure that it is frequently cleaned and disinfected. Ensure opportunities to sign-up for time in the garden are shared in an equitable fashion for all garden users.

Cleaning and disinfection

Follow CDC and EPA’s Guidance on Cleaning and Disinfection to prepare and maintain a safe environment for staff, volunteers, and gardeners. Use EPA List N-approved disinfectants against COVID-19pdf icon. Always read and follow label instructions for each product.

Routinely clean, sanitize, and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, such as entrance gate latches, portable toilets, water spigots, and hoses.

Consider limiting or suspending use of shared tools and equipment. Encourage gardeners to bring their own, if feasible. If using shared tools or equipment (hand tools, wheelbarrows, garden carts, tillers, etc.), ensure that they are cleaned and disinfected before and after use. You may consider scheduling more time than usual between groups of gardeners to ensure all high contact surfaces and shared equipment/tools are cleaned and disinfected.

If you have restrooms or port-a-potties available, set up a schedule to frequently clean and disinfect all surfaces, and replenish soap, sanitizers, or paper products.

Use disposable gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash: After using disposable gloves, throw them out in a lined trash can. Do not disinfect or reuse the gloves. Wash hands after removing gloves.

Ensure you have enough supplies for staff, volunteers, vendors, and customers to clean their hands and cover their coughs and sneezes. Supplies include soap, water, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, a way to dry hands, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch trash cans.

"COVID-19 Considerations for Animal Activities at Fairs, Shows, and Other Events","Fairs and agricultural shows pose unique One Health risks because they bring together crowds of people and animals with opportunities for close contact among them and mixing of different animals from different places. Events like these can contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person but may also pose a risk of infection to certain types of animals.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, show organizers should follow CDC’s Considerations for Events and Gatherings when deciding whether to hold, postpone, or cancel a fair, agricultural show, or other event where animals may be exhibited. Planners should also act in accordance with state and local jurisdictional guidance with regards to continuing operations at fair grounds or agricultural shows. For general disease prevention when interacting with animals, follow advice in the Compendium of Measures to Prevent Disease Associated with Animals in Public Settingspdf iconexternal icon, which provides standard recommendations on reducing the risk of disease related to animal contact in public settings for public health officials, veterinarians, animal venue operators, animal exhibitors (e.g., 4-H programs), visitors to animal venues and exhibits, teachers, camp operators, and others. Additional information and a checklist on biosecurity measures to prevent zoonotic diseases from spreading at fairs and animal exhibitions may be found in the NASPHV’s Resources on Zoonotic Influenzaexternal icon.

Fair and agricultural show organizers should consider the potential for COVID-19 to spread from person to person, person to animal, and possibly from animal to animal. The risk of animal-to-person spread is considered low. However, it appears that people can spread the virus to animals in some situations, usually during close contact. Event organizers should take precautions to minimize transmission of all zoonotic diseases between people and animals.

Some animals have been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, including pet cats and dogs in the United States. To date, there have been no reports of horses, cows, pigs, chickens, or ducks testing positive for SARS-COV-2. More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.

Precautions for animals

Although there have been no reports of livestock being infected with SARS-CoV-2, other types of animals have been infected. We are still learning about this virus and how it might affect different animals. Take precautions to prevent the potential spread of the virus among animals at your event.

Implement additional precautions to maintain at least 6 feet separation between any species shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, including cats and other felids; dogs; small mammals such as mink, ferrets, and rabbits; and other animals external icon shown to be susceptible to this virus. Prohibit susceptible animals from fairgrounds if they are not involved in fair or show activities. Prevent direct contact and institute policies to ensure at least 6 feet separation is maintained between these susceptible animals and other animals and between these animals and people. The number of exhibitors and animals that can safely fit in a show ring or exhibit area may limit the number of animals that can be shown at one time.

shown to be susceptible to this virus. Follow good biosecurity external icon practices to prevent the spread of pathogens between the fair and the farm. These include management practices on the farm, in transit, and at the destination. Biosecurity applies to both people and animals and includes these practices: Use good hand hygiene. Keep visitors on the farm to a minimum. Clean and disinfect all equipment, tools, and other items between uses. Wear proper attire and PPE when coming in to contact with animals or where they live. Monitor animals for signs of illness.

practices to prevent the spread of pathogens between the fair and the farm. These include management practices on the farm, in transit, and at the destination. Biosecurity applies to both people and animals and includes these practices: Do not allow admission of any animals that are sick. Animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a range of clinical signs including fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, runny nose, eye discharge, vomiting, or diarrhea. All animals should receive a screening examination from a veterinarian, veterinary technician, or experienced animal care and handling specialist before being allowed on the premises. Agricultural fairs may require a health certificate from a licensed veterinarian for each animal brought to fair grounds. Animals should be examined daily for signs of illness. Exhibitors should report sick animals to the fair veterinarian or designee immediately.

Prevent contact between pens of animals from different farms or households to prevent unnecessary interactions. Prevention may be accomplished by spacing out pens, staggering animals with an empty pen in between, or making other arrangements based on the facility.

Place pens and stalls in a manner that keeps the public at least 6 feet away from the animal.

Clean and disinfect animal areas frequently, including between uses for different animal species.

Use facilities that provide adequate ventilation for animals and people.

Limit interactions and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between animals and people and between people, including fair staff, judges, and the public who are not from the same farm or household as the animal or its caretaker.

Do not put masks on animals. Covering an animal’s face can harm it.

Do not wipe or bathe animals with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use.

Maintaining healthy environments in animal interaction areas

If the event will have a petting zoo or other animal interaction area, take precautions in addition to normal infectious disease prevention methods to protect animals and people from infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Do not permit animals that are at higher risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 in petting zoos or other animal interaction areas. This includes cats and other felids, small mammals like mink, ferrets and rabbits, and dogs.

Include hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit to petting zoos and other exhibits where people will be interacting with animals. Visitors should wash their hands before and after entering the area, even if they didn’t touch animals. Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations. If soap and water are not readily available, provide hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. If possible, staff should be assigned at the exit to actively encourage hand washing.

Visitors to animal areas should wear a mask inside the animal area, if able. Masks are not recommended for children under 2 years or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance.

Do not use common feed dispensers and other shared surfaces that cannot be cleaned and disinfected between uses.

Increase distance and limit the duration of contact (no more than 15 minutes) between visitors and between visitors and workers: People should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other. Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (e.g., guides for creating one-way routes). Eliminate lines or queues if possible or encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by providing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks When designing petting zoo and other animal interaction areas, allow for social distancing and avoid high densities of people. Provide separate entry and exit points for visitors so they do not need to pass close together while coming into and going out of the petting zoo.

Limit items allowed in the animal area. Do not allow strollers, food, backpacks, or other items in the animal area.

Do not allow visitors to share their food with animals.

Discourage visitors from kissing or snuggling with animals or sitting on the ground in animal areas.

Use EPA-approved disinfectants external icon against COVID-19 to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as door handles/gates and shared objects in petting zoos and animal interaction areas.

Livestock and horse shows

To maintain social distancing, consider the following steps:

Split classes to limit the number of animals in the show ring.

Cattle, horse, sheep, and goat shows naturally lend to social distancing when on the walk; adapt spacing to maintain distance between participants.

Limit the number of people and/or animals in a ring to ensure that at least 6 feet is kept between an animal and its handler and other people and animals including judges. The number of exhibitors and animals that can safely fit in a show ring or exhibit area may limit the number of animals that can be shown at one time.

Provide separate entry and exit points for visitors so they do not need to pass close together while coming into and going out of the ring.

Stagger activities in washing and grooming areas, or other shared spaces, so that animals from different farms or households do not interact unnecessarily and so that people can maintain a distance of at least 6 feet apart from each other.

Stagger animal move-in/move-out times to reduce contact between people and animals.

Consider a “show-and-go” with animals stalled at a trailer and leaving immediately after the show if this will not compromise animal welfare, for example, because of weather conditions such as high temperature and humidity.

Considerations for Owners and Operators of Multifamily Housing Including Populations at Increased Risk for Complications from COVID-19,"Multifamily housing (e.g., apartments, condominiums, townhouses, duplexes, and quadruplexes) pose a challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic due to potential for increased risk of exposure for residents and staff. The following guidance is provided to help owners, administrators, and operators of multifamily housing work together with residents, staff, and public health officials to create a safe living environment and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Public health actions needed to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing, can lead some people to feel isolated and lonely or can increase stress and anxiety. This page provides guidance in assessing and reducing exposure risks and resources for coping with stress in healthy ways.

These considerations are especially important for multifamily housing for older adults, residents living in settings that incorporate congregate or supportive services (e.g., multifamily housing that caters to older adults, low-income families, people with disabilities, etc.), and other populations who are at increased risk for acquiring COVID-19 and having complications. Other examples include individuals and families served through programs such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Public Housing Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly, Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilitiesexternal icon, and Project-Based Rental Assistanceexternal icon, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Multifamily Housing Rental Assistance Programexternal icon, or properties funded through the Low-Income Housing Tax Creditexternal icon program.

Guiding principles

Older adults and groups experiencing disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.

Other factors may increase an individual’s risk for severe illness, such as underlying medical conditions.

Although older adults and people with underlying conditions face particular risks, everyone should take steps to protect themselves from exposure to the virus causing COVID-19.

Communal spaces, community activities, and close living quarters in multifamily housing increase the risk of getting and spreading the virus

COVID-19 is mostly spread person-to-person through respiratory droplets released when people cough, sneeze, or talk. Less commonly, COVID-19 may also be acquired when someone touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their nose, mouth, or eyes. COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Therefore, personal prevention practices such as social distancing, using masks, frequent handwashing with soap and water or hand sanitizing when handwashing with soap and water is not possible, cough etiquette, and staying home when sick, are important to reduce COVID-19. Other environmental prevention practices, such as environmental cleaning and disinfection, are also important. Administrators can take clear-cut actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread in their communities and at their facilities.

Develop a plan

During an infectious disease outbreak, such as the current outbreak of COVID-19, property owners, administrators, and operators should prepare to identify residents at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, collaborate with their local health departments, and protect their employees’ health and safety.

See CDC’s guidance for preparing businesses and employees for the effects of COVID-19.

Consider the unique needs of your residents, such as disabilities, cognitive decline, or lack of access to technology. This guidance does not address infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. If your facility offers healthcare services, consult CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.

State, territorial, local, and tribal public health departments can provide specific information on COVID-19 transmission and policies in your community, which can help you decide when and if you need to scale up or relax specific prevention measures.

Promote behaviors that reduce spread

Encourage residents and staff to practice behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19. An individualized approach for COVID-19 may be needed for people with physical or intellectual disabilities or who have difficulty accessing information. Some residents require close contact with direct service providers, (e.g., home care nurses, therapists, social workers, etc.), have trouble understanding information, have difficulties with changes in routines, or have other concerns related to their disability.

Self-isolate or quarantine when appropriate

Encourage mask wearing

Encourage use of CDC-recommended masks among residents, workers, and visitors in common areas and in public.

Advise residents to avoid others who are not wearing masks or to ask others around them to wear masks.

Some residents may not be able to wear masks or are recommended not to wear masks: Wearing masks may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues. Masks should not be worn by children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Adaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading if it is not possible to wear one.

Encourage social distancing

In general, interacting with more people, especially closely and for longer times, increases risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.

Avoid gatherings of 10 or more people.

Encourage social distancing by asking workers and residents who are not from the same household and visitors to stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart whenever possible. Social distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.

Avoid close contact with visitors. For example, don’t shake hands, elbow bump or hug. Instead consider waving and verbal greetings.

Ensure adequate supplies in common areas

Support healthy hygiene behaviors by providing supplies, including soap, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, a way to dry hands, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans.

Display relevant signs and messages

Post signs in highly visible locations (e.g., building entrances, stairways, elevators) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread of germs (such as social distancing, by properly washing hands, proper cough etiquette, and properly wearing a mask).

Include messages (for example, videos, posters) about behaviors that prevent the spread of COVID-19 when communicating with residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors (such as on websites, in emails, in facility newsletters, and on social media accounts). Find free CDC print and digital resources on CDC’s communications resources main page. Identify and address potential language, cultural, and environmental barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information. Consider developing communication materials in alternative formats (e.g., large print, braille, ASL) for people who have low vision or are blind or people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Consider developing communication materials for people with low literacy and using plain or easy to understand language or visuals. Communications may need to be framed or adapted so they are culturally appropriate for your audience and easy to understand. CDC has communication resources available in many languages.



Maintain healthy environments in common areas

Multifamily housing complexes may consider several strategies to maintain healthy environments.

Ensure adequate ventilation

Consider conducting ventilation system upgrades or other steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants in the building. Obtain consultation from experienced Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) professionals when making changes to HVAC systems and equipment. Some of the recommendations below are based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon. Review additional ASHRAE guidelines for multifamily buildingsexternal icon for further information on ventilation recommendations for different types of building and building readiness for occupancy. Not all steps are applicable for all scenarios.

Improvement steps may include some or all of the following activities:

Increase outdoor air ventilation, using caution in highly polluted areas. Increase outdoor air by opening windows and doors, when weather conditions allow. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to persons using the facility. Use fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows. Position fans securely and carefully in or near windows to avoid potentially contaminated air flowing from one person to another. Strategic window fan placement in exhaust mode can help draw fresh air into room via other open windows and doors without generating strong room air currents. Decrease occupancy in common areas where outdoor ventilation cannot be increased.

Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and provide acceptable indoor air quality for the current occupancy level for each space.

Increase total airflow supply to occupied spaces, when possible.

Disable demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on occupancy or temperature during occupied hours.

Further open minimum outdoor air dampers to reduce or eliminate HVAC air recirculation. In mild weather, this will not affect thermal comfort or humidity; however, this may be difficult to do in cold, hot, or humid weather.

Improve central air filtration: Increase air filtration external icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow. Inspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass. Check filters to ensure they are within service life and appropriately installed.

Consider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after the space is occupied.

Ensure restroom exhaust fans are functional and operating at full capacity when the space is occupied.

Inspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as restrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, or other areas of high occupancy.

Use portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning, especially in higher risk areas such as common spaces.

to help enhance air cleaning, especially in higher risk areas such as common spaces. Generate clean-to-less-clean air movement by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers or dampers, especially in higher-risk areas such as common spaces.

Consider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation pdf icon external icon (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited.

*Note: The ventilation intervention considerations listed above come with a range of initial costs and operating costs. There are also risk assessment parameters to consider, such as community incidence rates, face mask compliance expectations, and common room density. These factors may affect which interventions are implemented.

Ensure safe water systems

Promote cleaning and disinfection

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., door handles, handicap door access switches, sink handles, grab bars, hand railings,) within common areas of facilities at least daily or between use as much as possible. Advise residents with sensory or respiratory issues to avoid these areas during and immediately after cleaning.

Limit use of shared objects in common areas (e.g., computer equipment, remote controls, print materials) when possible, and clean and disinfect shared objects between use.

Develop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.

Provide staff with training about the safe and correct use and storage of cleaners and disinfectants.

Use products that meet EPA List N disinfection criteria external icon . Use products according to the manufacturer’s labeled directions.

. Use products according to the manufacturer’s labeled directions. Encourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to keep personal items (e.g., cell phones, other electronics), and personal work and living spaces clean. Offer assistance with cleaning and disinfecting for residents with disabilities who may require supervision

Encourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to use disinfectant wipes to wipe down objects and surfaces before and after use.

Ensure safe congregate spaces

Modified layouts

Social distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.

Alter schedules to reduce mixing and close contact, such as staggering activity times and forming small groups that regularly participate at the same times and do not mix with individuals in other groups.

Arrange seating of chairs and tables to be at least 6 feet apart during events.

Minimize traffic in enclosed spaces, such as mailrooms, elevators, and stairwells.

Consider limiting the number of individuals in an elevator at one time and designating one-directional stairwells and hallways, if possible.

Ensure that social distancing can be maintained in communal spaces.

Physical barriers and guides

Install physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., reception areas).

Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart. Use formats that are accessible to residents, including for those with visual impairments.

Safe communal spaces

Social distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.

Close indoor shared spaces such as game rooms, computer rooms, exercise rooms, and lounges if needed to ensure safety of the residents.

Otherwise, stagger use and restrict the number of people allowed in at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart, and clean and disinfect between use.

Prioritize outdoor activities where possible.

Limit the presence of non-essential volunteers and visitors in shared areas, when possible.

Clean and disinfect common-area bathrooms regularly (e.g., in the morning and evening, after times of heavy use) using EPA List N-registered disinfectants external icon following the manufacturer’s labeled directions.

following the manufacturer’s labeled directions. Maintain access and adequate supplies to laundry facilities. Restrict the number of people allowed in laundry rooms at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart.

Consider closing exercise rooms. Alternatively, stagger use, increase air flow by opening windows where possible, and clean and disinfect between use.

Consider closing pools and hot tubs or limiting access to pools for essential activities only, such as water therapy. Consider additional prevention activities for public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds during COVID-19 for those that remain open.

Conduct maintenance and inspection visits

To the extent allowed by law or regulation consider:

Deferring maintenance inside units for non-critical or non-life-threatening problems.

Deferring routine in-unit inspections, especially for assisted units which may have regular mandatory inspections. Owners and operators of assisted units should be aware that authorities may have issued temporary waivers or guidance regarding inspections during the pandemic.

Maintain healthy operations

Multifamily housing complexes may consider several strategies to maintain healthy operations.

Protections for residents and workers at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Offer options for those at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions) that limit their exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities, virtual participation in community events).

Consistent with applicable law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions.

Regulatory awareness

Be aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to multifamily housing to determine if events or activities can be held.

Identify strategies to maintain operations and a healthy working and living environment

Review CDC’s guidance for businesses and employers.

Identify an onsite coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 issues and their impact at the workplace.

Develop flexible sick leave policies for staff. Require staff to stay home when sick, even without documentation from doctors. Use flexibility, when possible, to allow staff to stay home to care for sick family or household members or to care for children in the event of school or childcare dismissals. Make sure that employees are aware of and understand these policies.

Create plans to protect the staff and residents from the spread of COVID-19 and help them put in place personal preventive measures.

Clean and disinfect shared areas (such as exercise room, laundry facilities, shared bathrooms, and elevators) and frequently touched surfaces using EPA List N-registered disinfectants external icon more than once a day, if possible.

more than once a day, if possible. Identify services and activities (such as meal programs, in-person religious services, and exercise rooms and programs) that might need to be limited or temporarily discontinued. Consider alternative solutions (e.g., virtual services) that will help programs continue while being safe for residents.

Establish policies and practices for social distancing.

Identify a list of healthcare and mental health facilities and alternative care sites where residents with COVID-19 can receive appropriate care, if needed.

Communication systems

Identify platforms such as email, websites, hotlines, automated text messaging, newsletters, and flyers to help communicate information on:

Visitors, service providers, and prospective tenants

Loneliness and social isolation in older adults are serious health risk factors. However, because in-person social interactions are associated with increased risk of infection, owners and operators of multifamily communities are encouraged to promote safe social activities among community residents and their support networks.

Residents should be encouraged to limit visitors to persons essential to maintaining their health, well-being, and safety.

Visitors should avoid entering the building or community, including common areas and residences , unless their presence is essential to preserving the health, including mental health, well-being, and safety of residents. This can include a wide array of service providers or even community or family support networks of older adult residents.

, unless their presence is essential to preserving the health, including mental health, well-being, and safety of residents. This can include a wide array of service providers or even community or family support networks of older adult residents. Visitors, service providers, and prospective tenants should follow personal protective measures and the recommendations set forth by the facility they are visiting, as well as local and state health directives.

personal protective measures and the recommendations set forth by the facility they are visiting, as well as local and state health directives. Visitors should also maintain social distance of at least six feet (2 meters) from residents to help reduce transmission.

Visitors, service providers, and prospective tenants should not visit if they recently had contact with someone who had symptoms of COVID-19.

Visitors should wear a mask while in the building and restrict their visit to the resident’s room or other location designated by the facility. Everyone should be reminded to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol when handwashing with soap and water is not possible.

Unit turnover and move-ins

Follow CDC’s guidance on cleaning and disinfecting your home.

Safely clean units and assist with unit turnovers and move-out/ins by learning how to protect yourself and others.

New units (especially high-touch surfaces) should be cleaned and disinfected using a disinfectant from the list of EPA List N-registered disinfectants external icon . Follow the manufacturer’s labeled directions.

. Follow the manufacturer’s labeled directions. Wait at least 24 hours since previous tenants left before cleaning and disinfecting in preparation for a new individual/family moving in. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.

Additional suggestions include Frequent cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, and faucets, during the moving process; Limiting the number of family members present during the move-in/out process; Maintaining social distancing between household members and movers and other residents; Requesting the proper use of masks; Providing handwashing materials – ideally soap, water and a way to dry hands if water is on in the unit, or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol – and encouraging frequent hand hygiene; Keeping windows and doors open, if possible, to increase ventilation



Prepare for when someone gets sick

If a resident in your multifamily housing unit has COVID-19 (suspected or confirmed)

Have the resident contact a healthcare provider to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.

Residents are not required to notify administrators if they think they may have or have a confirmed case of COVID-19.

If you do receive information that someone in your housing unit has COVID-19, work with the local health department to notify anyone in the unit who may have been exposed (had close contact with the sick person) while maintaining the confidentiality of the sick person as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and, if applicable, the Fair Housing Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Provide the sick person with information on how to care for themselves and when to seek medical attention.

Help address misunderstandings about why people are being asked for personal information, and why this information is important for stopping spread of COVID-19 among family, friends, and communities.

Encourage residents with COVID-19 symptoms to self-isolate and their roommates and close contacts to quarantine. This includes limiting contact of residents with COVID-19 symptoms with any pets or service animals in the household or facility to protect them from possible infection.

Those with COVID-19 symptoms and their close contacts should limit their use of shared spaces as much as possible. Follow guidance on when to stop isolation and when to end quarantine.

Minimize the number of staff members who have face-to-face interactions with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

Encourage staff, other residents, caregivers such as outreach workers, and others who visit people with COVID-19 symptoms to follow recommended precautions to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.

Staff at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should not have close contact with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19, if possible.

Those who have been in close contact (less than 6 feet or 2 meters) with a resident for a total of 15 minutes or more who has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should monitor their health and call their healthcare provider if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.

Be prepared to provide accessible transportation to people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for testing or non-urgent medical care.

Avoid transporting people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis unless it is the only accessible option. Follow guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting any transport vehicles.

If multiple cases are suspected, contact the local public health department to report the cases and to offer to an accessible community testing site, provide a platform for information-sharing, or share community insights.

Clean and disinfect

Close off areas used by someone that has or may have COVID-19 and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting.

Wait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting.

If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.

Provide staff with training about the safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection products, including storing products securely away from children and pets.

Watch for symptoms in residents and their family members

People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:

Fever or chills

Cough

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Fatigue

Muscle or body aches

Headache

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Congestion or runny nose

Nausea or vomiting

Diarrhea

This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19.

In some cases, older adults and people of any age with underlying health conditions may have symptoms that are not typically seen in others, or they may take longer than others to develop fever and other symptoms.

When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If a resident is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately: Trouble breathing

Persistent pain or pressure in the chest

New confusion

Inability to wake or stay awake

Bluish lips or face * This list does not include all possible symptoms. Call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.

Additional CDC resources to help prevent spread of COVID-19 in multifamily housing

More detailed guidance is available for specific types of facilities. Some of the information in these guidance documents is applicable to that specific type of facility only, and some of the information would be applicable to other congregate housing facilities.",##########,
People Experiencing Homelessness,"People experiencing unsheltered homelessness (those sleeping outside or in places not meant for human habitation) may be at risk for infection when there is community spread of COVID-19. This interim guidance is intended to support response to COVID-19 by local and state health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, emergency planners, healthcare facilities, and homeless outreach services. Homeless shelters and other facilities should also refer to the Interim Guidance for Homeless Shelters. Community and faith-based organizations can refer to the Interim Guidance for Communities of Faith for other information related to their staff and organizations.

COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus. We are learning about how it spreads, how severe it is, and other features of the disease.

Lack of housing contributes to poor physical and mental health outcomes, and linkages to permanent housing for people experiencing homelessness should continue to be a priority. In the context of COVID-19 spread and transmission, the risks associated with sleeping outdoors or in an encampment setting are different than from staying indoors in a congregate setting such as an emergency shelter or other congregate living facility. Outdoor settings may allow people to increase physical distance between themselves and others. However, sleeping outdoors often does not provide protection from the environment, adequate access to hygiene and sanitation facilities, or connection to services and healthcare. The balance of risks should be considered for each individual experiencing unsheltered homelessness.

Community coalition-based COVID-19 prevention and response

Planning and response to COVID-19 transmission among people experiencing homelessness requires a “whole community”external icon approach, which means involving partners in the response plan development, with clearly outlined roles and responsibilities. Table 1 outlines some of the activities and key partners to consider for a whole-community approach.

Table 1: Using a community-wide approach to prepare for COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness

table 1 Connect to community-wide planning Connect with key partners to make sure that you can all easily communicate with each other while preparing for and responding to cases. A community coalition focused on COVID-19 planning and response should include: Local and state health departments

Outreach teams and street medicine providers

Homeless service providers and Continuum of Care leadership

Emergency management

Law enforcement

Healthcare providers

Housing authorities

Local government leadership

Other support services like case management, emergency food programs, syringe service programs, and behavioral health support

People with lived experiences of homelessness People with lived experiences of homelessness can help with planning and response. These individuals can serve as peer navigators to strengthen outreach and engagement efforts. Develop an advisory board with representation from people with current or former experiences of homelessness to ensure community plans are effective. Identify additional sites and resources Continuing homeless services during community spread of COVID-19 is critical. Make plans to maintain services for all people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Furthermore, clients who are positive for COVID-19 need to have access to services and a safe place to stay, separated from others who are not infected. To facilitate the continuation of services, community coalitions should identify resources to support people sleeping outside as well as additional temporary housing, including sites with individual rooms that are able to provide appropriate services, supplies, and staffing. These sites should include: Overflow sites to accommodate shelter decompression and higher shelter demands

Isolation sites for people who are confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 by laboratory testing

Quarantine sites for people who are awaiting testing, awaiting test results, or who were exposed to COVID-19

Protective housing for people who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 Depending on resources and staff availability, housing options that have individual rooms (such as hotels/motels) and separate bathrooms should be considered for the overflow, quarantine, and protective housing sites. In addition, plan for how to connect clients to housing opportunities after they have completed their stay in these temporary sites.

Communication

Outreach workers and other community partners, such as emergency food provision programs or law enforcement, can help ensure people sleeping outside have access to updated information about COVID-19 and access to services.

Stay updated on the local level of transmission of COVID-19 through your local external icon and state health departments.

and state health departments. Build on existing partnerships with peer navigators who can help communicate with others.

Maintain up-to-date contact information and areas frequented for each person.

Communicate clearly with people sleeping outside. Use health messages and materials developed by credible public health sources, such as your local and state public health departments or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Post signs in strategic places (e.g. near handwashing facilities) providing instruction on hand washing and cough etiquette pdf icon . Provide educational materials about COVID-19 for non-English speakers, those with low literacy or intellectual disabilities, and people who are hearing or vision impaired. Ensure communication with clients about changes in homeless services policies and/or changes in physical location of services such as food, water, hygiene facilities, regular healthcare, and behavioral health resources.

Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to workers, volunteers, and those you serve. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures.

Considerations for outreach staff

Staff training and policies

Provide training and educational materials related to COVID-19 for staff.

Minimize the number of staff members who have face-to-face interactions with clients.

Develop and use contingency plans for increased absenteeism caused by employee illness or by illness in employees’ family members. These plans might include extending hours, cross-training current employees, or hiring temporary employees.

Assign outreach staff who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 to duties that do not require them to interact with clients in person.

Outreach staff should review stress and coping resources for themselves and their clients during this time.

Staff prevention measures

Encourage outreach staff to maintain good hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol) on a regular basis, including before and after each client interaction

Advise staff to maintain 6 feet of distance while interacting with clients and other staff, where possible.

Require outreach staff to wear masks when working in public settings or interacting with clients. They should still maintain a distance of 6 feet from each other and clients, even while wearing masks.

Advise outreach staff to avoid handling client belongings. If staff are handling client belongings, they should use disposable gloves, if available. Make sure to train any staff using gloves to ensure proper use and ensure they perform hand hygiene before and after use. If gloves are unavailable, staff should perform hand hygiene immediately after handling client belongings.

Outreach staff who are checking client temperatures should use a system that creates a physical barrier between the client and the screener as described here. Where possible, screeners should remain behind a physical barrier, such as a car window, that can protect the staff member’s face from respiratory droplets that may be produced if the client sneezes, coughs, or talks. If social distancing or barrier/partition controls cannot be put in place during screening, PPE (i.e., facemask, eye protection [goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face], and a single pair of disposable gloves) can be used when within 6 feet of a client. However, given PPE shortages, training requirements, and because PPE alone is less effective than a barrier, try to use a barrier whenever you can.

For street medicine or other healthcare staff who are providing medical care to clients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and close contact (within 6 feet) cannot be avoided, staff should at a minimum, wear eye protection (goggles or face shield), an N95 or higher level respirator (or a facemask if respirators are not available or staff are not fit tested), disposable gown, and disposable gloves. Masks are not PPE and should not be used when a respirator or facemask is indicated. Healthcare providers should follow infection control guidelines.

Healthcare providers should follow infection control guidelines. Outreach staff who do not interact closely (e.g., within 6 feet) with sick clients and do not clean client environments do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).

Outreach staff should launder work uniforms or clothes after use using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.

Staff process for outreach

In the process of conducting outreach, staff should Greet clients from a distance of 6 feet and explain that you are taking additional precautions to protect yourself and the client from COVID-19. If the client is not wearing a mask, provide them with one. Screen clients for symptoms by asking them if they feel as if they have a fever, cough, or other symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Children have similar symptoms to adults and generally have mild illness Older adults and persons with medical comorbidities may have delayed presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms. If medical attention is necessary, use standard outreach protocols to facilitate access to healthcare. Continue conversations and provision of information while maintaining 6 feet of distance. If at any point you do not feel that you are able to protect yourself or your client from the spread of COVID-19, discontinue the interaction and notify your supervisor. Examples include if the client declines to wear a mask or if you are unable to maintain a distance of 6 feet.



Considerations for people experiencing unsheltered homelessness

Help clients prevent becoming sick with COVID-19

Consider the balance of these risks when addressing options for decreasing COVID-19 spread. Those who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness face several risks to their health and safety.

Continued linkage to homeless services, housing, medical, mental health, syringe services, and substance use treatment, including provision of medication-assisted therapies (e.g., buprenorphine, methadone maintenance, etc.). Use telemedicine, when possible.

Some people who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness may be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to older age or certain underlying medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease or serious heart conditions. Reach out to these clients regularly to ensure they are linked to care as necessary. Prioritize providing individual rooms for these clients, where available.

Recommend that all clients wear masks any time they are around other people. Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Provide clients with hygiene materials, where available.

Discourage clients from spending time in crowded places or gathering in large groups, for example at locations where food, water, or hygiene supplies are being distributed. If it is not possible for clients and staff to avoid crowded places, encourage spreading out (at least6 feet between people) to the extent possible and wearing masks.



Help link sick clients to medical care

Regularly assess clients for symptoms. Clients who have symptoms may or may not have COVID-19. Make sure they have a place they can safely stay in coordination with local health authorities. If available, a nurse or other clinical staff can help with clinical assessments. These clinical staff should follow personal protective measures. Provide anyone who presents with symptoms with a mask. Facilitate access to non-urgent medical care as needed. Use standard outreach procedures to determine whether a client needs immediate medical attention. Emergency signs include (this list is not all inclusive. Please refer clients for medical care for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you): Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion or inability to arouse Bluish lips or face Notify the designated medical facility and personnel to transfer that clients might have COVID-19.

If a client has tested positive for COVID-19 Use standard outreach procedures to determine whether a client needs immediate medical attention. If immediate medical attention is not required, facilitate transportation to an isolation site. Notify designated medical facility and personnel that the client has tested positive for COVID-19. If medical care is not necessary, and if no other isolation options are available, advise the individual on how to isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support. During isolation, ensure continuation of behavioral health support for people with substance use or mental health disorders. In some situations, for example due to severe untreated mental illness, an individual may not be able to comply with isolation recommendations. In these cases, community leaders should consult local health authorities to determine alternative options. Ensure the client has a safe location to recuperate (e.g., respite care) after isolation requirements are completed, and follow-up to ensure medium- and long-term medical needs are met.



Considerations for encampments

If individual housing options are not available, allow people who are living unsheltered or in encampments to remain where they are. Clearing encampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This increases the potential for infectious disease spread.

Encourage those staying in encampments to set up their tents/sleeping quarters with at least 12 feet x 12 feet of space per individual. If an encampment is not able to provide sufficient space for each person, allow people to remain where they are but help decompress the encampment by linking those at increased risk for severe illness to individual rooms or safe shelter.

Work together with community coalition members to improve sanitation in encampments.

Ensure nearby restroom facilities have functional water taps, are stocked with hand hygiene materials (soap, drying materials) and bath tissue, and remain open to people experiencing homelessness 24 hours per day.

If toilets or handwashing facilities are not available nearby, assist with providing access to portable latrines with handwashing facilities for encampments of more than 10 people. These facilities should be equipped with hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol).

Interim Guidance for Homeless Service Providers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"People experiencing homelessness are at risk for infection during community spread of COVID-19. This interim guidance is intended to support response planning by emergency management officials, public health authorities, and homeless service providers, including overnight emergency shelters, day shelters, and meal service providers.

COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus. We are learning about how it spreads, how severe it is, and other features of the disease. Transmission of COVID-19 in your community could cause illness among people experiencing homelessness, contribute to an increase in emergency shelter usage, and/or lead to illness and absenteeism among homeless service provider staff.

Early and sustained action to slow the spread of COVID-19 will keep staff and volunteers healthy, and help your organization maintain normal operations.

Community coalition-based COVID-19 prevention and response

Planning and response to COVID-19 transmission among people experiencing homelessness requires a “whole community”external icon approach, which means that you are involving partners in the development of your response planning, and that everyone’s roles and responsibilities are clear. Table 1 outlines some of the activities and key partners to consider for a whole-community approach.

Table 1: Using a community-wide approach to prepare for COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness

table 1 Connect to community-wide planning Connect with key partners to make sure that you can all easily communicate with each other while preparing for and responding to cases. A community coalition focused on COVID-19 planning and response should include: Local and state health departments

Homeless service providers and Continuum of Care leadership

Emergency management

Law enforcement

Healthcare providers

Housing authorities

Local government leadership

Other support services like outreach, case management, and behavioral health support Identify additional sites and resources Continuing homeless services during community spread of COVID-19 is critical, and homeless shelters should not close or exclude people who are having symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 without a plan for where these clients can safely access services and stay.

Decisions about whether clients with mild illness due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should remain in a shelter, or be directed to alternative housing sites, should be made in coordination with local health authorities. Community coalitions should identify additional temporary housing and shelter sites that are able to provide appropriate services, supplies, and staffing.Ideally, these additional sites should include: Overflow sites to accommodate shelter decompression (to reduce crowding) and higher shelter demands

Isolation sites for people who are confirmed to be positive for COVID-19

Quarantine sites for people who are waiting to be tested, or who know that they were exposed to COVID-19

Protective housing for people who are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 Depending on resources and staff availability, non-group housing options (such as hotels/motels) that have individual rooms should be considered for the overflow, quarantine, and protective housing sites. In addition, plan for how to connect clients to housing opportunities after they have completed their stay in these temporary sites.

Communication

Stay updated on the local level of transmission of COVID-19 through your local and state health departments.

Communicate clearly with staff and clients. Use health messages and materials developed by credible public health sources, such as your local and state public health departments or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Post signs at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on hand washing and cough pdf icon [1 page] etiquette, use of masks, and social distancing. Provide educational materials about COVID-19 for non-English speakers or hearing impaired, as needed. Keep staff and clients up-to-date on changes in facility procedures. Ensure communication with clients and key partners about changes in program policies and/or changes in physical location.

Identify platforms for communications such as a hotline, automated text messaging, or a website to help disseminate information to those inside and outside your organization. Learn more about communicating to workers in a crisis external icon .

. Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to workers, volunteers, and those you serve. Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures.

Supplies

Have supplies on hand for staff, volunteers, and those you serve, such as:

Soap

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol

Tissues

Trash baskets

Masks

Cleaning supplies

Personal protective equipment (PPE), as needed by staff (see below)

Staff considerations

Provide training and educational materials related to COVID-19 for staff and volunteers.

Minimize the number of staff members who have face-to-face interactions with clients with respiratory symptoms.

Develop and use contingency plans for increased absenteeism caused by employee illness or by illness in employees’ family members. These plans might include extending hours, cross-training current employees, or hiring temporary employees.

Staff and volunteers who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should not be designated as caregivers for sick clients who are staying in the shelter. Identify flexible job duties for these increased risk staff and volunteers so they can continue working while minimizing direct contact with clients.

Put in place plans on how to maintain social distancing (remaining at least 6 feet apart) between all clients and staff while still providing necessary services.

All staff should wear a mask for source control (when someone wears a mask over their mouth and nose to contain respiratory droplets), consistent with the guidance for the general public. See below for information on laundering washable masks.

Staff who do not interact closely (e.g., within 6 feet) with sick clients and do not clean client environments do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).

Staff should avoid handling client belongings. If staff are handling client belongings, they should use disposable gloves, if available. Make sure to train any staff using gloves to ensure proper use and ensure they perform hand hygiene before and after use. If gloves are unavailable, staff should perform hand hygiene immediately after handling client belongings.

Staff who are checking client temperatures should use a system that creates a physical barrier between the client and the screener as described here. Screeners should stand behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition that can protect the staff member’s face from respiratory droplets that may be produced if the client sneezes, coughs, or talks. If social distancing or barrier/partition controls cannot be put in place during screening, PPE (i.e., facemask, eye protection [goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face], and a single pair of disposable gloves) can be used when within 6 feet of a client. However, given PPE shortages, training requirements, and because PPE alone is less effective than a barrier, try to use a barrier whenever you can.

For situations where staff are providing medical care to clients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and close contact (within 6 feet) cannot be avoided, staff should at a minimum, wear eye protection (goggles or face shield), an N95 or higher level respirator (or a facemask if respirators are not available or staff are not fit tested), disposable gown, and disposable gloves. Cloth face coverings are not PPE and should not be used when a respirator or facemask is indicated. If staff have direct contact with the client, they should also wear gloves. Infection control guidelines for healthcare providers are outlined here.

If staff have direct contact with the client, they should also wear gloves. Infection control guidelines for healthcare providers are outlined here. Staff should launder work uniforms or clothes after use using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.

Provide resources for stress and coping to staff. Learn more about mental health and coping during COVID-19.

Facility layout considerations

Use physical barriers to protect staff who will have interactions with clients with unknown infection status (e.g., check-in staff). For example, install a sneeze guard at the check-in desk or place an additional table between staff and clients to increase the distance between them to at least 6 feet.

In meal service areas, create at least 6 feet of space between seats, and/or allow either for food to be delivered to clients or for clients to take food away.

In general sleeping areas (for those who are not experiencing respiratory symptoms), try to make sure client’s faces are at least 6 feet apart. Align mats/beds so clients sleep head-to-toe.

For clients with mild respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19: Prioritize these clients for individual rooms. If individual rooms are not available, consider using a large, well-ventilated room. Keep mats/beds at least 6 feet apart. Use temporary barriers between mats/beds, such as curtains. Align mats/beds so clients sleep head-to-toe. If possible, designate a separate bathroom for these clients. If areas where these clients can stay are not available in the facility, facilitate transfer to a quarantine site.

For clients with confirmed COVID-19, regardless of symptoms: Prioritize these clients for individual rooms. If more than one person has tested positive, these clients can stay in the same area. Designate a separate bathroom for these clients. Follow CDC recommendations for how to prevent further spread in your facility. If areas where these clients can stay are not available in the facility, assist with transfer to an isolation site.



Facility ventilation considerations

Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and per established local/national codes. Increase the indoor delivery of outdoor air as much as possible. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to clients, staff, volunteers, or visitors using the facility.

Consider taking steps to improve ventilation in the building, in consultation with an HVAC professional, based on local environmental conditions (temperature/humidity) and ongoing community transmission in the area. Identifying the best steps for your specific facility will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to layout, number of occupants, environmental factors, and available resources. Potential steps include: Increase the percentage of outdoor air (e.g., using economizer modes of HVAC operations) potentially as high as 100% (first verify compatibility with HVAC system capabilities for both temperature and humidity control as well as compatibility with outdoor/indoor air quality considerations). Increase total airflow supply to occupied spaces, if possible. Disable demand-control ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on temperature or occupancy. Consider using natural ventilation (i.e., opening windows if possible and safe to do so) to increase outdoor air dilution of indoor air when environmental conditions and building requirements allow. If temperatures outside make it difficult to leave multiple windows open, consider safely securing window fans or box fans (sealing the perimeter around the box fan) to blow air out of selected windows. The resulting make-up air will come into the building via multiple leak points and blend with indoor air as opposed to a single unconditioned incoming air stream. Improve central air filtration: Increase air filtration external icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow. Inspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass. Consider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after occupied times. Generate clean-to-less-clean air movements pdf icon external icon by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers and adjusting zone supply and exhaust flow rates to establish observable pressure differentials. Have staff work in “clean” ventilation zones that do not include higher-risk areas such as visitor reception or exercise facilities (if open). Careful placement of window exhaust fans can also assist in establishing directional airflow.

Consider using portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning pdf icon external icon (especially in higher-risk areas). HEPA systems not only capture and remove potentially infectious particles in the air but their clean air discharge is just as beneficial as fresh outdoor air when it comes to diluting contaminants.

(especially in higher-risk areas). HEPA systems not only capture and remove potentially infectious particles in the air but their clean air discharge is just as beneficial as fresh outdoor air when it comes to diluting contaminants. Ensure exhaust fans in kitchens and restroom facilities are functional and operating at full capacity when the building is occupied. Consider running exhaust fans for several hours before and after occupied times when possible.

Consider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) pdf icon external icon as a supplemental technique to inactivate potential airborne virus in the upper-room air of common occupied spaces. Seek consultation with a reputable UVGI manufacturer or an experienced UVGI system designer prior to installing and operating UVGI systems.

Facility procedure considerations

Plan to maintain regular operations to the extent possible.

Limit visitors who are not clients, staff, or volunteers.

Do not require a negative COVID-19 viral test for entry to a homeless services site unless otherwise directed by local or state health authorities.

Identify clients who could be at increased risk for complications from COVID-19, or from other chronic or acute illnesses, and encourage them to take extra precautions.

Arrange for continuity of and surge support for mental health, substance use treatment services, and general medical care.

Identify a designated medical facility to refer clients who might have COVID-19.

Keep in mind that clients and staff might be infected without showing symptoms. Create a way to make physical distancing between clients and staff easier, such as staggering meal services or having maximum occupancy limits for common rooms and bathrooms. All clients should wear masks any time they are not in their room or on their bed/mat (in shared sleeping areas). Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

Regularly assess clients and staff for symptoms. Clients who have symptoms may or may not have COVID-19. Make sure they have a place they can safely stay within the shelter or at an alternate site in coordination with local health authorities. An on-site nurse or other clinical staff can help with clinical assessments. Provide anyone who presents with symptoms with a mask. Facilitate access to non-urgent medical care as needed. Use standard facility procedures to determine whether a client needs immediate medical attention. Emergency signs include: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion or inability to arouse Bluish lips or face Notify the designated medical facility and personnel to transfer clients that the client might have COVID-19.

Prepare healthcare clinic staff to care for patients with COVID-19, if your facility provides healthcare services, and make sure your facility has supply of personal protective equipment pdf icon [1 page] .

. Provide links to respite (temporary) care for clients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 but have been discharged. Some of these clients will still require isolation to prevent transmission. Some of these clients will no longer require isolation and can use normal facility resources.

Make sure bathrooms and other sinks are consistently stocked with soap and drying materials for handwashing. Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol at key points within the facility, including registration desks, entrances/exits, and eating areas.

Washable masks used by clients and staff should be laundered regularly. Disposable masks should not be laundered. Staff involved in laundering masks should do the following: Masks should be collected in a sealable container (like a trash bag). Staff should wear disposable gloves and a face mask. Use of a disposable gown is also recommended, if available. Gloves should be properly removed and disposed of after laundering washable masks; clean hands immediately after removal of gloves by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at least daily and shared objects between use using an EPA- registered disinfectant external icon .

Screening Clients for COVID-19 at Homeless Shelters or Encampments,"The following is a screening tool that can be used to identify people with possible symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although not every person who has symptoms will have COVID-19, conducting daily screenings consisting of a series of simple questions can help identify people who may need medical care or isolation.

If someone screens positive for symptoms, they should be directed to where they can stay according to a predesignated plan developed with the local Continuum of Care (CoC), public health department, and community leadership. For more details, see the Interim Guidance for Homeless Service Providers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Interim Guidance on Unsheltered Homelessness and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for Homeless Service Providers and Local Officials.

Determine if the client has a fever, by: Taking their temperature using a temporal thermometer (see box), AND Asking “Have you felt like you had a fever in the past day?”

Ask the client “Do you have a new or worsening cough today?” Ask the client, “Do you have any of these other symptoms? Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Fatigue

Muscle or body aches

Headache

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Congestion or runny nose

Nausea or vomiting

Diarrhea

If the client has a fever OR a new/worsening cough OR any of the other symptoms:

Provide a mask for the client to wear over their nose and mouth, if one is available and if the client can tolerate it. If a mask is not available, advise the client about cough etiquette and provide tissues. Masks should not be placed on children younger than 2 years old, anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, anyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Notify management and appropriate healthcare providers. Direct the client to an isolation room if available, or to the area designated for persons with symptoms of COVID-19. If your shelter does not have an area for people with symptoms, redirect the person to the location prespecified by your CoC, public health department, and community leadership. Let the client know: If their symptoms worsen, they should notify a member of the homeless shelter staff immediately.

They should not leave their room/the designated area except to use the restroom and they should stay at least 6 feet away from others.

If they leave their room/the designated area, they must wear a mask.

They should wash their hands often or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Interim Considerations for Health Departments for SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Homeless Shelters and Encampments,"Note: This document is intended to provide considerations on the appropriate use of testing and does not dictate the determination of payment decisions or insurance coverage of such testing, except as may be otherwise referenced (or prescribed) by another entity or federal or state agency. CDC is a non-regulatory agency; therefore, the information in this document is meant to assist health departments and homeless service providers in making decisions rather than establishing regulatory requirements.

Homeless service provider sites and encampments can present unique challenges for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) investigations and public health action. In congregate settings such as homeless shelters, the virus may spread easily among clients, staff, and volunteers. Additionally, many people experiencing homelessness are older adults or have underlying medical conditions [1], [2], which are risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19. This document describes testing strategies for homeless shelters and encampments. Testing to diagnose COVID-19 is one strategy and should be used in conjunction with promoting behaviors that reduce spread, maintaining healthy environments, maintaining healthy operations, and preparing for when someone gets sick.

State, Tribal, territorial, and local health departments should review these considerations in the context of local recommendations, resources, acceptability, and feasibility. These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any federal, state, local, territorial, or Tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations. For details on appropriate procedures and safety measures and personal protective equipment to use during testing, see procedure for testing in congregate settings.

The purpose and process of all testing and other public health activities should be clearly communicated to clients and staff at the homeless service site to promote understanding and acceptability. Testing strategies should be carried out in a way that protects privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible and that is consistent with applicable laws and regulations. In addition to state and local laws, regulations and policies, site administrators should follow guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionexternal icon when offering testing to staff.

Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"How to Protect Yourself and Others from COVID-19

COVID-19 is the short name for “coronavirus disease 2019.” It is caused by a new virus that is mainly spread from person to person. Doctors and scientists are still learning about it. Recently, this virus has made many people sick. Here’s what you need to know to help protect yourself and people you care about from COVID-19.

Stay in touch with your case workers, group home staff, or shelter staff. They can help you to know what’s happening with COVID-19 in your community.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If you don’t have soap and water, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol . Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

with unwashed hands. You can get sick from other people who are sick, so try to stay away from them as much as possible. Help them get to medical care if they need it.

Avoid hanging out in groups. If you need to be in a group, stay at least two arms lengths (6 feet) from other people.

Wear a mask Masks are not for children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is not awake or can’t take the mask off by themselves. See more information on masks.

Stay connected even if you have to be apart. If you feel sad, lonely, scared, or anxious, reach out for help from a counselor or case worker or call the youth homelessness hotline at: 1-888-373-7888. Reach out to your family, friends, and case workers on the phone or online if possible. Use a buddy system to make sure you and your friends are safe.

Be aware that there might be changes in locations or hours of operation for food, housing, mental health, substance use, and health care services.

If you get sick

Some of the symptoms of COVID-19 are cough, a hard time breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell. If you have any of these symptoms, let someone (like a case worker) know so you can get help if needed.

If your symptoms get worse (like you have trouble breathing or pain/pressure in your chest, confusion or bluish lips or face), call 911 or get immediate help from a doctor.

Whenever you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash.

Continue to wear a mask when you are around other people.

Ask for help from case workers, group home staff, or shelter staff to find a safe place to stay while you get better.

Interim Considerations for SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Correctional and Detention Facilities,"Note: This document is intended to provide considerations on the appropriate use of testing and does not dictate the determination of payment decisions or insurance coverage of such testing, except as may be otherwise referenced (or prescribed) by another entity or federal or state agency. CDC is a non-regulatory agency; therefore, the information in this document is meant to assist correctional and detention facilities in making decisions rather than establishing regulatory requirements.

Correctional and detention facilities can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement the following proposed testing strategies. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, and acceptable, and should be tailored to the needs of each facility. These considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which facilities must comply.

CDC offers considerations for correctional and detention facilities to plan, prepare, and respond to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities. Testing to diagnose COVID-19 is one component of a comprehensive strategy and should be used in conjunction with a number of other prevention and mitigation activities described in the interim guidance.

Testing symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and initiating medical isolation for suspected and confirmed cases and quarantine for close contacts (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more) can help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in correctional and detention facilities. This page provides considerations for implementing SARS-CoV-2 testing among incarcerated and detained persons and facility staff. Any time a positive test result is identified, ensure that the individual is rapidly notified, connected to appropriate medical care, and medical isolation is initiated. See CDC’s Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities for further details related to responding to cases. Correctional and detention facilities should follow guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionexternal icon when instituting and offering testing to staff, and when staff are preparing to return to work. Note that symptom screening, testing, and contact tracing strategies should be carried out in a way that protects privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible and that is consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

Types of COVID-19 tests

Viral tests are recommended to diagnose current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Viral tests evaluate whether the virus is present in a respiratory sample. Results from viral tests help identify and isolate people who are infected in order to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Antibody tests are used to detect a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. CDC does not currently recommend using antibody testing as the sole basis for diagnosing current infection. Depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it is currently not proven whether a positive antibody test indicates protection against future SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore, antibody tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune.

CDC recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing are based on what is currently known about the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is new, and what is known about it changes rapidly. Information on testing for SARS-CoV-2 will be updated as more information becomes available.

When testing might be needed

This page describes three scenarios when incarcerated or detained persons (IDP) or staff in correctional and detention facilities may need to have an initial SARS-CoV-2 viral test:

Testing individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19

Testing asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission

Testing asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification

This page also outlines considerations for planning broad-based testing in correctional and detention facilities (i.e., testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons), including:

Practical considerations for implementing broad testing for SARS-CoV-2 in correctional and detention facilities

Checklist of considerations to help facilities make decisions about how and when to test broadly for SARS-CoV-2

These considerations are intended to provide evidence-based strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing among IDP and staff who work in correctional and detention facilities. Depending on the context, specific testing considerations may be applied to IDP, staff, or both.

Testing individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19

Consistent with CDC’s recommendations, individuals (including staff and IDP) with COVID-19 signs or symptoms should be referred to a healthcare provider for evaluation for testing.

One strategy to identify individuals with COVID-19 signs or symptoms and to help lower the risk of transmission is to conduct temperature screening and/or symptom checks. To identify individuals with symptoms, facilities should integrate temperature screening and symptom checks into their standard practices (i.e., among IDP at intake, prior to discharge/release or transfer; daily staff screening; screening of volunteers and vendors upon entry). Screenings should be conducted safely and respectfully and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. See guidance on how to conduct temperature screening and symptom checks in the Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities.

Note that symptom screenings cannot identify individuals with COVID-19 who may be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, and therefore will not prevent all individuals with COVID-19 from entering the facility.

Testing asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission

Testing is recommended for all close contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection:

Broader testing strategy beyond close contacts

Congregate living or working conditions, such as in correctional and detention facilities, have potential for rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Performing contact tracing in correctional and detention settings may be resource-intensive and challenging (e.g., the number of close contacts of infected IDP in a housing unit with a dormitory-style sleeping area and shared restrooms and shower facilities may be large; outside public health staff conducting contact tracing may have limited access to correctional and detention facilities, and it may be necessary to conduct interviews with cases and close contacts over the phone). If contact tracing is not practicable, or if there is concern for widespread transmission following identification of new-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection among IDP or staff, facility management should consider a broader testing strategy, beyond testing only close contacts within the facility, to reduce the chances of a large outbreak.

Practical considerations for implementing a broader testing strategy should include the availability of resources and the ability to act on results of testing. Decisions about testing strategies in correctional and detention facilities should be made in collaboration with state/local health departments.

Depending on fac­ility characteristics and available resources, targeted (e.g., a specific housing unit) or facility-wide testing should be considered if a single IDP or staff member in the facility tests positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Incoming IDPs testing positive at intake should be placed immediately into medical isolation and provided medical care. As long as these individuals have not yet been in contact with the rest of the facility’s population, this circumstance would not trigger broader testing,

Quarantine and additional testing for close contacts

All persons who are close contacts of someone with COVID-19 (e.g., IDP and staff assigned to the housing unit where someone tested positive for SARS-CoV-2) should be provided with cloth face coverings (if not already wearing them, and unless contraindicated), and the IDP should be placed under quarantine restrictions for 14 days after their last exposure.

Staff

Management should consider requiring asymptomatic staff who have been identified as close contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case to home quarantine to the maximum extent possible, while understanding the need to maintain adequate staffing levels of critical workers. Workers in critical infrastructure sectors (including correctional and detention facilities) may be permitted to work if they remain asymptomatic after a potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, provided that worker infection prevention recommendations and controls are implemented, including requiring the staff member to wear a cloth face covering (unless contraindicated) at all times while in the workplace for 14 days after the last exposure (if not already wearing one due to universal use of cloth face coverings).

If the exposed staff members test positive, they should follow local health department and health care provider instructions regarding home isolation.

Incarcerated or detained persons (IDP)

Because correctional and detention facilities may not have enough space to provide an individual cell for each quarantined IDP, they may need to form cohorts of quarantined IDP who were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at the same time.

Some IDP in a quarantined cohort may be infected without showing symptoms or may not test positive due to early stage infection. Infected persons may transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others several days before the onset of symptoms, or even if they never develop symptoms. To prevent continued transmission of the virus within a quarantined cohort, re-testing those who originally tested negative every 3 to 7 days could be considered, until no new cases are identified for 14 days after the most recent positive result. The specific re-testing interval that a facility chooses could be based on: The stage of the ongoing outbreak (i.e., more frequent testing in the context of escalating outbreaks, less frequent testing when transmission has slowed) The availability of testing supplies and capacity of staff to perform repeat testing without negatively impacting other essential health care services Financial resources to fund repeat testing, including procurement of testing supplies, laboratory testing services, and personal protective equipment (PPE) The capacity of on-site, contract laboratories, or public health laboratories that will be performing the tests The expected wait time for test results (and resulting capacity for timely action based on the results)

If IDP who are close contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case test positive for SARS-CoV-2, they should be placed under medical isolation. If an IDP who tested positive was part of a quarantine cohort, restart the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder of the cohort.

See detailed guidance on recommendations for how to organize quarantine and medical isolation in correctional and detention settings in Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities.

Limitations of a re-testing strategy include:

Facilities may not have staff and testing capacity to organize testing of large numbers of IDP on a serial basis.

Long wait times for receiving large numbers of test results may make frequent re-testing impractical to implement.

Frequent re-testing within a quarantine cohort may result in a prolonged quarantine period for the entire cohort if one individual tests positive part-way through quarantine and the 14-day clock must be restarted. It may become challenging to find space to quarantine individuals in correctional or detention facilities for extended periods of time.

Frequent re-testing may become burdensome for IDP and increase the proportion of individuals who decline testing.

Practical considerations for implementing re-testing of quarantined individuals should include the availability of space, resources, potential limitations of this strategy and the ability to act on results. The decision about frequency of re-testing in correctional and detention facilities should be made in collaboration with state/local health departments.

Testing asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification

Correctional and detention facilities may consider testing asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 exposure in communities with moderate to substantial levels of community transmission. Practical considerations for implementing this strategy include the availability of resources, timeliness of results, and the ability for a coordinated response between the health department or other testing agency/provider and the correctional or detention facility. Decisions about testing strategies in correctional and detention facilities should be made in collaboration with state/local health departments. The testing strategies below aim to reduce the risk of introducing SARS-CoV-2 into the correctional or detention facility (i.e., testing newly incarcerated or detained persons) and to reduce the risk of widespread transmission through early identification of infection among existing IDP and staff. Facilities in communities with moderate to substantial levels of community transmission can consider the following:

Baseline testing for all current IDP.

Testing all new IDP at intake before they join the rest of the population in the facility, and housing them individually while test results are pending to prevent potential transmission. Some facilities may choose to implement a “routine intake quarantine” in which new IDP are housed individually for 14 days before being integrated into general housing.

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 and reviewing results before transferring IDP to another facility or releasing them to the community, particularly if an IDP will transition to a congregate setting with persons at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Refer to Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities for more information about transfer and release recommendations. Consider combining pre-transfer/release testing with a 14-day quarantine (ideally in single cells) before an individual’s projected transfer or release date to further reduce risk of transmission to other facilities or the community.

Transmission-based precautions for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases

Staff

All staff with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear cloth face coverings (if not already wearing one, and unless contraindicated), self-isolate at home, connect with appropriate medical care as soon as possible, and follow medical care and instructions.

Incarcerated or detained persons (IDP)

All IDP with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be provided with cloth face coverings (if not already wearing one, and unless contraindicated), connected to appropriate medical care as soon as possible, and placed in medical isolation until medical care and instructions can be provided.

Criteria for discontinuing medical isolation of IDP with COVID-19

For persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness who are not severely immunocompromised, medical isolation can be discontinued when: At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared (or since first positive viral test, if asymptomatic), At least 24 hours have passed since last fever , without the use of fever-reducing medications, and Symptoms have improved.

medical isolation can be discontinued when: For persons with severe illness or who are severely immunocompromised , medical isolation can be discontinued when: At least 20 days have passed since symptoms first appeared (or since first positive viral test, if asymptomatic), At least 24 hours have passed since last fever , without the use of fever-reducing medications, and Symptoms have improved. Consider consultation with infection control experts.

Guidance and Tips for Tribal Community Living During COVID-19,"Everyone has a role to play to reduce and slow the transmission of COVID-19. Social distancing is an essential step in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing is reducing physical interaction between people and it lowers the chances of spreading illness between people. Practice social distancing by putting space (at least 6 feet) between yourself and others. It is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

These people include older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions. People can follow social distancing by reducing how often they are physically near others, reducing the overall number of people they are physically near, and by keeping at least 6 feet away from others when they do leave their homes. Staying physically apart is important, even in places like the workplace, school, when shopping, or in other places in your community. The goal of social distancing is to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.",##########,
Manufacturing Workers and Employers,"Cloth face coverings in manufacturing work CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings as a protective measure in addition to social distancing (i.e., staying at least 6 feet away from others). Cloth face coverings may be especially important when social distancing is not possible or feasible based on working conditions. A cloth face covering may reduce the amount of large respiratory droplets that a person spreads when talking, sneezing, or coughing. Cloth face coverings may prevent people who do not know they have the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading it to others. Cloth face coverings are intended to protect other people—not the wearer. Cloth face coverings are not PPE. They are not appropriate substitutes for PPE such as respirators (like N95 respirators) or medical facemasks (like surgical masks) in workplaces where respirators or facemasks are recommended or required to protect the wearer. While wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in communities, wearing a single cloth face covering for the full duration of a work shift (e.g., eight or more hours) in a manufacturing facility may not be practical if the face covering becomes wet, soiled, or otherwise visibly contaminated during the work shift. If cloth face coverings are worn in these facilities, employers should provide readily available clean cloth face coverings (or disposable facemask options) for workers to use when the coverings become wet, soiled, or otherwise visibly contaminated. Employers who determine that cloth face coverings should be worn in the workplace, including to comply with state or local requirements for their use, should ensure the cloth face coverings: fit over the nose and mouth and fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face;

are secured with ties or ear loops;

include multiple layers of fabric;

allow for breathing without restriction;

can be laundered using the warmest appropriate water setting and machine dried daily after the shift, without damage or change to shape (a clean cloth face covering should be used each day);

are not used if they become wet or contaminated;

are replaced with clean replacements, provided by the employer, as needed.

are handled as little as possible to prevent transferring infectious materials to or from the cloth; and

are not worn with or instead of respiratory protection when respirators are needed.

Educate and train workers and supervisors about how they can reduce the spread of COVID-19

Supplement workers’ normal and required job training (e.g., training required under OSHA standards) with additional training and information about COVID-19, including recognizing signs and symptoms of infection and ways to prevent exposure to the virus. Training should include information about how to implement the various infection prevention and control measures recommended here and included in any infection prevention and control or COVID-19 response plan that an employer develops. OSHA provides additional informationexternal icon about training on its COVID-19 webpage.

All communication and training should be easy to understand and should (1) be provided in languages appropriate to the preferred languages spoken or read by the workers, if possible; (2) be at the appropriate literacy level; and (3) include accurate and timely information about:

Signs and symptoms of COVID-19, risks for workplace exposures, the spread of the virus, and how workers can protect themselves;

Proper handwashing practices and use of hand sanitizer stations;

Cough and sneeze etiquette; and

Other routine infection control precautions (e.g., signs and symptoms of COVID-19, putting on or taking off masks or cloth face coverings and social distancing measures).

Employers should place simple posters in all of the languages that are common in the worker population that encourage staying home when sick (or after testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19), cough and sneeze etiquette, and proper hand hygiene practices. They should place these posters at the entrance to the workplace and in break areas, locker rooms, and other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.

CDC has free, simple posters available to download and print, some of which are translated into different languages. The Stop the Spread of Germs posterpdf icon is available in Amharicpdf icon, Arabicpdf icon, Burmesepdf icon, Daripdf icon, Farsipdf icon, Frenchpdf icon, Haitian Creolepdf icon, Kinyarwandapdf icon, Karenpdf icon, Koreanpdf icon, Nepalipdf icon, Pashtopdf icon, Portuguesepdf icon, Russianpdf icon, Simplified Chinesepdf icon, Somalipdf icon, Spanishpdf icon, Swahilipdf icon, Tigriynapdf icon, Ukrainianpdf icon, and Vietnamesepdf icon.

Employers should post signs that you can read from a far distance (or use portable, electronic reader boards) that inform visitors and workers of social distancing practices.

Employers should provide alternative training for workers who cannot read written materials or who require other reasonable accommodations.

OSHA understands that some employers may face difficulties complying with OSHA standards due to the ongoing health emergency, including those standards that require certain types of worker training. OSHA is providing enforcement discretionexternal icon around the completion of training and other provisions in its various standards. OSHA has instructed its Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs) to evaluate whether an employer has made a good faith effort to comply with applicable OSHA standards and, in situations where compliance was not possible given the ongoing pandemic, to ensure that employees were not exposed to hazards from tasks, processes, or equipment for which they were not prepared or trained.

Cleaning and disinfection in manufacturing

For tool-intensive operations, employers should ensure tools are regularly cleaned and disinfected, including at least as often as workers change workstations or move to a new set of tools. Refer to List Nexternal icon on the EPA website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2.

Establish protocols and provide supplies to increase the frequency of sanitization in work and common spaces. Disinfect frequently touched surfaces in workspaces and break rooms (e.g., microwave and refrigerator handles, vending machine touchpads, knobs, levels, and sink handles) at least once per shift, if possible. For example, wipe down tools or other equipment at least as often as workers change workstations. Frequently clean push bars and handles on any doors that do not open automatically and handrails on stairs or along walkways. If physical barriers are being used, then these should be cleaned frequently.

Workers who perform cleaning and disinfection tasks may require additional PPE and other controls to protect them from chemical hazards posed by disinfectants. Note: Employers must ensure their written hazard communication programexternal icon is up to date and training is up to date for all employees. (Also, see OSHA’s enforcement discretion memorandumexternal icon on this topic.) Employers may need to adapt guidance from this section, the Environmental Services Workers and Employersexternal icon section, and the Interim Guidance for Workers and Employers of Workers at Increased Risk of Occupational Exposureexternal icon, to fully protect workers performing cleaning and disinfection activities in manufacturing workplaces.

Screening[1] and monitoring workers

Workplaces, particularly in areas where community transmission of COVID-19 is occurring, should consider developing and implementing a comprehensive screening and monitoring strategy aimed at preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into the work site. Consider a program of screening workers before entry into the workplace, criteria for exclusion of sick workers, including asymptomatic workers who have tested positive for COVID-19; and criteria for return to work of exposed and recovered (those who have had signs or symptoms of COVID-19 but have gotten better).. This type of program should be coordinated to the extent possible with local public health authorities and could consist of the following activities:

Screening of workers for COVID-19

Screening manufacturing workers for COVID-19 symptoms (such as temperature checks) is an optional strategy that employers can use. If implemented for all workers, policies and procedures for screening workers should be developed in consultation with state and local health officials and occupational medicine professionals. Options to screen workers for COVID-19 symptoms include:

Screen before entry into the facility.

Provide verbal screening in appropriate language(s) to determine whether workers have had symptoms including a cough or shortness of breath, or at least two of these: fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell. in the past 24 hours.

Check temperatures of workers at the start of each shift to identify anyone with a fever of 100.4°F or greater (or reported feelings of feverishness). Ensure that screeners: Are trained to use temperature monitors and monitors are accurate under conditions of use (such as cold temperatures); and Wear appropriate PPE.

Do not let employees enter the workplace if they have a fever of 100.4°F or greater (or reported feelings of feverishness), or if screening results indicate that the worker is suspected of having COVID-19. Encourage workers to self-isolate and contact a healthcare provider; Provide information on the facility’s return-to-work policies and procedures; and Inform human resources, employer health unit (if in place), and supervisor (so the worker can be moved off schedule during illness and a replacement can be assigned, if needed).



Ensure that personnel performing screening activities, including temperature checks, are appropriately protected from exposure to potentially infectious workers entering the facility:

Implement engineering controls, such as physical barriers or dividers or rope and stanchion systems, to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between screeners and workers being screened.

If screeners need to be within 6 feet of workers, provide them with appropriate PPE based on the repeated close contact the screeners have with other workers. Such PPE may include gloves, a gown, a face shield, and, at a minimum, a face mask. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (or more protective) may be appropriate for workers performing screening duties and necessary for workers managing a sick employee in the work environment (see below) if that employee has signs or symptoms of COVID-19. If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard external icon (29 CFR 1910.134).



Managing sick workers

Workers who appear to have symptoms including a cough or shortness of breath, or at least two of these: fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell upon arrival at work or who become sick during the day should immediately be separated from others at the workplace and sent home.

Ensure that personnel managing sick employees are appropriately protected from exposure. When personnel need to be within 6 feet of a sick colleague, appropriate PPE may include gloves, a gown, a face shield and, at a minimum, a face mask. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (or more protective) may be appropriate for workers managing a sick employee if that employee has signs or symptoms of COVID-19. If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standardexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.134).

If a worker is confirmed to have COVID-19 (regardless of whether that has had symptoms of COVID-19), employers should inform anyone they have come into contact with (including fellow workers, inspectors, graders, etc.) of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but should maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The employer should instruct fellow workers about how to proceed based on the CDC Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure.

If a worker becomes or reports being sick, or testing positive for COVID-19, disinfect the workstation used and any tools handled by the worker.

Employers should work with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health officials to facilitate the identification of other exposed and potentially exposed individuals, such as coworkers in a plant.

On-site healthcare personnel, such as facility nurses or emergency medical technicians, should follow appropriate CDC and OSHAexternal icon guidance for healthcare and emergency response personnel.

Addressing return to work

Critical infrastructure employers have an obligation to manage the continuation of work and return to work of their workers in ways that best protect the health of workers, their coworkers, and the general public. Employers should consider providing screening and ongoing medical monitoring of these workers, ensuring they wear an appropriate source control device (e.g cloth face covering and/or face shield) in accordance with CDC and OSHA guidance and any state or local requirements, and implementing social distancing to minimize the chances of workers exposing one another.

Critical infrastructure employers should continue to minimize the number of workers present at work sites, balancing the need to protect workers with support for continuing critical operations.

Reintegration (bringing back) of exposed, asymptomatic workers to on-site operations should follow the CDC Critical Infrastructure Guidance. The guidance advises that employers may permit workers who have been exposed to COVID-19, but remain without symptoms, to continue to work, provided they adhere to additional safety precautions. Consultation with an occupational health provider and state and local health officials will help employers develop the most appropriate plan.

Reintegration of workers with COVID-19 (COVID-19 positive), including those workers who have remained asymptomatic, to on-site operations should follow the CDC interim guidance, “Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings.” As noted above, consultation with an occupational health provider and state and local health officials will help employers develop the most appropriate plan.

As employers move forward with continuing essential work, they should implement strategies to prioritize positions without which critical work would stop. This prioritization should include an analysis of work tasks, workforce availability at specific work sites, and assessment of hazards associated with the tasks and work site. Employers may be able to cross-train workers to perform critical duties at a work site to minimize the total number of workers needed to continue operations.

For workers who have had signs/symptoms of COVID-19

Both workers with COVID-19 who have symptoms and those that have tested positive for COVID-19and have stayed home (home isolated) should not return to work until they have met the criteria to discontinue home isolation, and have consulted with their healthcare providers and state and local health departments.

The situation is constantly changing, so employers of critical infrastructure workers will need to continue to reassess the virus’s transmission levels in their area and follow recommendations from local, state, and federal officials. This guidance does not replace state and local directives for businesses.

Personal protective equipment

Employers must conduct a hazard assessment to determine if hazards for which workers need PPE are present, or are likely to be present. OSHA’s PPE standardsexternal icon (29 CFR 1910 Subpart I) require employers to select and provide appropriate PPE to protect workers from hazards identified in the hazard assessment. The results of that assessment will be the basis of workplace controls (including PPE) needed to protect workers.

Employers should:

Use videos or in-person visual demonstrations of proper PPE donning (putting on) and doffing(removal) procedures. (Maintain social distancing during these demonstrations.)

Emphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off PPE to ensure that the worker or the item does not become contaminated.

Provide PPE that is either disposable (preferred) or, if reusable, ensure it is properly disinfected and stored in a clean location when not in use.

PPE worn at the facility should not be taken home or shared.

Face shields may serve as both PPE and source control:

If helmets are being used, use face shields designed to attach to helmets.

Face shields can provide additional protection from both potential process-related splashes and potential person-to-person droplet spread. Safety glasses may fog up when used in combination with masks or cloth face coverings. Only some face shields are acceptable substitutions for eye protection (such as safety glasses) that are used for impact protection; facilities should consult with an occupational safety and health professional concerning the use of face shields.

Face shields can help minimize contamination of masks and cloth face coverings.

If used, face shields should be cleaned and decontaminated after each shift, and when not in use they should be kept in a clean location at the work facility.

If used, face shields should also wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin.

Employers should stress hand hygiene before and after handling all PPE. Employers in manufacturing industries should continue to stay up to date on the most current guidance concerning PPE.

As part of their hazard assessments, employers must always consider whether PPE is necessary to protect workers. Specifically, when engineering and administrative controls are difficult to maintain and there may be exposure to other workplace hazards, such disinfectants used for facility cleaning, PPE should be considered.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturing employers should consider allowing voluntary use of filtering facepiece respirators (such as an N95, if available) for their workers, even if respirators are not normally required. Employers who permit voluntary use of respirators must comply with applicable provisions of OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standardexternal icon (29 CFR 1910.134), including proving a copy of Appendix D – Information for Employees Using Respirators When Not Required Under Standardexternal icon to employees who use such equipment.

In addition to face shields as noted above, workers in manufacturing facilities may need PPE such as gloves, face and eye protection, and other types of PPE when cleaning and disinfecting manufacturing plants (including frequently touched surfaces), tools, and equipment.

When PPE is needed, employers should consider additional hazards created by poorly fitting PPE (e.g., mask ties that dangle or catch, PPE that is loose and requires frequent adjustment or tends to fall off), including hazards resulting from use of such PPE in a particular work environment (e.g., where workers are around machinery in which PPE could get caught).

Workers’ rights

Section 11(c)external icon of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970external icon (29 USC 660(c)) prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for raising concerns about safety and health conditions. Additionally, OSHA’s Whistleblower Protection Programexternal icon enforces the provisions of more than 20 industry-specific federal laws protecting employees from retaliation for raising or reporting concerns about hazards or violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health insurance reform, motor vehicle safety, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime, securities, and tax laws. OSHA encourages workers who suffer such retaliation to submit a complaint to OSHAexternal icon as soon as possible in order to file their complaint within the legal time limits, some of which may be as short as 30 days from the date they learned of or experienced retaliation. An employee can file a complaint with OSHA by visiting or calling his or her local OSHA office; sending a written complaint via fax, mail, or email to the closest OSHA office; or filing a complaint onlineexternal icon. No particular form is required, and complaints may be submitted in any language.

OSHA provides recommendations intended to assist employers in creating workplaces that are free of retaliation and guidance to employers on how to properly respond to workers who may complain about workplace hazards or potential violations of federal laws. OSHA urges employers to review its publication Recommended Practices for Anti-Retaliation Programspdf iconexternal icon.

[1] Employers should evaluate the burdens and benefits of recording workers’ temperatures or asking them to complete written questionnaires. These types of written products become records that must be retained for the duration of the workers’ employment plus 30 years.

Workers with COVID-19 who have symptoms and have stayed home (home isolated) should not return to work until they have met the criteria to discontinue home isolation, and have consulted with their healthcare providers and state and local health departments.

The situation is constantly changing, so employers of critical infrastructure workers will need to continue to reassess the virus’s transmission levels in their area.

Personal protective equipment

Employers must conduct a hazard assessment to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, for which workers need PPE. OSHA’s PPE standards (29 CFR 1910 Subpart Iexternal icon) require employers to select and provide appropriate PPE to protect workers from hazards identified in the hazard assessment. The results of that assessment will be the basis of workplace controls (including PPE) needed to protect workers.

Employers should:

Use videos or in-person visual demonstrations of proper PPE donning and doffing procedures. (Maintain social distancing during these demonstrations.)

Emphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off PPE to ensure that the worker or the item does not become contaminated.

Provide PPE that is either disposable (preferred) or, if reusable, ensure it is properly disinfected and stored in a clean location when not in use.

PPE worn at the facility should not be taken home or shared.

Face shields may serve as both PPE and source control:

If helmets are being used, use face shields designed to attach to helmets.

Face shields can provide additional protection from both potential process-related splashes and potential person-to-person droplet spread. Safety glasses may fog up when used in combination with masks or cloth face coverings. Only some face shields are acceptable substitutions for eye protection (such as safety glasses) that are used for impact protection; facilities should consult with an occupational safety and health professional concerning the use of face shields.

Face shields can help minimize contamination of masks and cloth face coverings.

If used, face shields should be cleaned and decontaminated after each shift, and when not in use they should be kept in a clean location at the work facility.

If used, face shields should also wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin.

Employers should stress hand hygiene before and after handling all PPE. Employers in meat and poultry processing industries should continue to stay up to date on the most current guidance concerning PPE.

As part of their hazard assessments, employers must always consider whether PPE is necessary to protect workers. Specifically, when engineering and administrative controls are difficult to maintain and there may be exposure to other workplace hazards, such as splashes or sprays of liquids on processing lines or disinfectants used for facility cleaning, PPE should be considered.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, meat and poultry processing employers should consider allowing voluntary use of filtering facepiece respirators (such as an N95, if available) for their workers, even if respirators are not normally required.

In addition to face shields as noted above, workers in meat and poultry processing facilities may need PPE such as gloves, face and eye protection, and other types of PPE when cleaning and disinfecting meat and poultry processing plants (including frequently touched surfaces), tools, and equipment.

When PPE is needed, employers should consider additional hazards created by poorly fitting PPE (e.g., mask ties that dangle or catch, PPE that is loose and requires frequent adjustment or tends to fall off) with respect to the work environment (e.g., machinery in which PPE could get caught).

Workers’ rights

Section 11(c)external icon of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970external icon, 29 USC 660(c), prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for raising concerns about safety and health conditions. Additionally, OSHA’s Whistleblower Protection Programexternal icon enforces the provisions of more than 20 industry-specific federal laws protecting employees from retaliation for raising or reporting concerns about hazards or violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health insurance reform, motor vehicle safety, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime, securities, and tax laws. OSHA encourages workers who suffer such retaliation to submit a complaint to OSHAexternal icon as soon as possible in order to file their complaint within the legal time limits, some of which may be as short as 30 days from the date they learned of or experienced retaliation. An employee can file a complaint with OSHA by visiting or calling his or her local OSHA office; sending a written complaint via fax, mail, or email to the closest OSHA office; or filing a complaint online. No particular form is required, and complaints may be submitted in any language.

OSHA provides recommendations intended to assist employers in creating workplaces that are free of retaliation and guidance to employers on how to properly respond to workers who may complain about workplace hazards or potential violations of federal laws. OSHA urges employers to review its publication Recommended Practices for Anti-Retaliation Programspdf iconexternal icon.

1 Employers should evaluate the burdens and benefits of recording workers’ temperatures or asking them to complete written questionnaires. These types of written products become records that must be retained for the duration of the workers’ employment plus 30 years. See OSHA’s Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records standard (29 CFR 1910.1020external icon).",##########,

Who these tools are for: These tools and resources are for occupational safety and health professionals and state and local public health officials.

Purpose: Occupational safety and health professionals and state and local public health officials can use these tools to assess coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection prevention and control measures at meat and poultry processing facilities, as well as these facilities’ overall hazard assessment and control plans.

The tools are based on Meat and Poultry Processing Workers and Employers – Interim Guidance from CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of COVID-19.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the CDC COVID-19 website periodically for updated interim guidance.",##########,
What Workers Need to Know about Heat Stress Prevention during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"More info about Heat Stress Employers

Your employer may tailor the existing heat illness prevention program and policies to the unique challenges of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Heat stress is the total amount of heat your body encounters. It may come from a variety of sources, such as:

Heat from work processes and machinery (e.g., forge)

Environmental temperatures, humidity, and lack of air movement (e.g., no wind or inadequate air circulation)

Internal metabolic processes (e.g., illnesses that create a fever)

Heat generated by your muscles from physical exertion

Clothing and personal protective equipment (PPE) may also trap heat, further increasing heat exposure.

Workers who are exposed to extreme heat, work in hot environments, or perform physically demanding work in moderate heat environments may be at risk for heat-related illnesses and injuries. The most severe form of heat-related illness is heat stroke, a life-threatening medical emergency that can result in death.

Early signs of heat stroke may include:

Confusion

Difficulty performing routine tasks or answering simple questions (e.g., “What is today’s date?” “Where are we?”)

Slurred speech

Late signs of heat stroke may include:

Seizures

Loss of consciousness

Organ failure resulting in death

In addition to training you on the signs and symptoms of heat-related illnesses, including heat stroke, your employer should provide instruction on general first aid and how to obtain prompt medical treatment for anyone who may experience a heat-related illness at work.

This CDC Guidance for Businesses and Employers highlights some of the changes you may see at your worksite to minimize the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Some of these may be part of your employer’s existing heat illness prevention program and may increase your risk for heat-related illnesses due to:",##########,
