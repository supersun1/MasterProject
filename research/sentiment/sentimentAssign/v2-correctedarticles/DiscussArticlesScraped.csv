Biden's lead shrinks in Pennsylvania in final days of race: poll,"A poll of Pennsylvania voters released Monday found that Joe Biden’s lead over President Trump in the key battleground state has shrunk in the final days of the race.

The Monmouth University Poll gives Biden a seven-point lead (51-44) in a “high turnout model” and a five-point lead in a low turnout (50-45) model — in which a large number of mail-in ballots are rejected. That’s down from a similar poll a month ago, which gave Biden an 11-point lead in a high turnout scenario and an eight-point lead in the low turnout.

JOE BIDEN BECOMES 'AN UNDERDOG' IF HE DOESN'T WIN PA., SAYS NATE SILVER

In the poll released Monday, among all registered voters, 50% support Biden and 45% back Trump. Also, 1% support Libertarian Jo Jorgensen and 4% are undecided or won’t reveal their vote.

“All eyes have been on the Keystone State from the start. Pennsylvania voters may have responded more than most to key events, such as the conventions and the debates. This potential for movement is one reason why both campaigns have spent so much time there,” Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.

The poll found Trump had edges on two issues: protecting jobs, and law and order. Biden held a major advantage on handling the COVID-19 pandemic.

The poll found that there had been movement in 10 swing counties in the state. Voters in those counties gave Biden a 53-42 edge last month but now go for Trump, 49-45.

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN'S LEAD OVER TRUMP NARROWS SLIGHTLY TO 8 POINTS

The state, with its 20 electoral votes, is seen as likely to decide the election by many analysts. FiveThirtyEight founder and pollster Nate Silver said on Sunday that Biden becomes the “underdog” if Trump wins the state. Both candidates held events in the Keystone State over the weekend and had planned appearances there Monday.

The poll comes after a New York Times/Siena College poll released Sunday that has Biden leading Trump by six points in Pennsylvania, as well as a number of other key swing states.

A Fox News poll in October found Biden with a five-point lead in Pennsylvania, which was within the poll’s margin of error, and was an increase in standing for Trump from its prior poll.

The Monmouth poll was conducted by telephone from Oct. 28 to Nov. 1 among 502 registered voters. It has a margin of error of +/- 4.4 points.

"Donald Trump: Reelect me and I will continue to deliver safety, prosperity and opportunity for all Americans","Four years ago, Americans elected me president to go to Washington, drain the swamp and produce real results for them. Now they have a choice: continue the record of prosperity that my administration delivered or return to the old Washington status quo, where Beltway insiders enriched themselves at the expense of hardworking Americans across the country.

My administration has delivered safety, prosperity and opportunity for all Americans by keeping our promises and implementing an America First agenda to support working people and their families over the past four years.

The American people deserve so much more than what the Democratic ticket has to offer in this election. After enduring eight disastrous years of the Obama-Biden mess, the nation deserves to enjoy eight full years of growth and economic prosperity under my administration.

INGRAHAM: TRUMP 'LIKELY SAVED US' BY RESISTING 'UNPROVEN STRATEGIES' FOR FIGHTING PANDEMIC

In my first three years in office, our country added more than 7 million new jobs, including more than 500,000 in the manufacturing sector. Throughout that time, nearly 6.6 million Americans were lifted out of poverty, including nearly 2.8 million children.

As a direct result of the middle-class tax cuts that I signed into law just months into my first year in office, the average American family of four saved $2,000. I also eliminated former President Barack Obama’s health care tax — the individual mandate provision of ObamaCare — in a move that provided millions of American households with additional relief.

My administration’s policies put America in a position to recover quickly from the unforeseen and unprecedented pandemic from China. Despite the challenges presented by the China virus, we did all we could to help see hardworking Americans through these difficult times.

Thanks to my emergency economic relief legislation, more than 159 million Americans received direct financial assistance during the pandemic. Meanwhile, our Paycheck Protection Program helped protect 51 million American jobs, allocating over $525 billion in forgivable loans for over 5.2 million small businesses.

As a result of our efforts and the tremendous momentum of the pre-pandemic economy, we’re witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history. The American economy grew at an annualized rate of 33.1 percent in the third quarter, another example of the economy beating expectations under my leadership. This is a new record for quarterly economic growth and is nearly double the previous record set 70 years ago.

In total, our economy has now added back 11.4 million jobs over the last five months, and the unemployment rate has nearly been cut in half to 7.9 percent.

The largest threat to our great American comeback is a Joe Biden presidency. Biden is running on a platform that would destroy all our economic progress. Biden has already failed at leading an economic recovery once when he presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression when he was vice president.

Now he’s campaigning on a $4 trillion tax hike — one of the largest in American history — just as the economy begins to recover from a global pandemic.

To add to Biden’s radical plans, he’s also refusing to rule out shutting down the economy again, which would inflict massive economic pain and long-lasting damage on society and public health as a whole.

Joe Biden has openly pledged to eliminate my tax cuts for middle-income Americans, implement radical environmental regulations that would bring our domestic energy revolution to an abrupt halt, and bring back Obama’s disastrous health care calamity.

Biden’s scare tactics extend to America’s seniors with false claims about my record on Social Security — lies that have been debunked many times. Biden points the finger, but he is the one who has advocated for cutting Social Security while I have always promised to protect it.

When it comes to trade, Biden’s unhealthy obsession with promoting China’s interests is a promise to abandon our America First trade strategy that has helped safeguard millions of new U.S. jobs and our incredible intellectual property.

Biden also issued a clear threat during the final presidential debate to over 10.3 million Americans with his pledge to eliminate the oil and natural gas industries.

This country has seen politicians like Biden before. He will surrender U.S. jobs to foreign countries, surrender our future to the virus, and surrender our country to the radical, socialist left.

America has already had to endure Biden’s leadership once before, and it can’t afford to do it again.

As president, I pledge to safeguard the progress my administration has made over the past four years and build on our historic success for as long as I am in the White House. I will continue doing everything in my power to ensure that this great country prospers like never before.

Joe Biden: I want your vote to become your next president — here’s what I will do for you and our nation,"Across our nation today, there are nearly 230,000 empty chairs at dining room tables, where just weeks or months ago loved ones sat and talked and laughed. There are 30 million Americans feeling the sting of a lost job or lost wages — 10 million who’ve had the peace of mind of health coverage taken away.

Parents are struggling to teach their kids at home — often while balancing their own jobs — because there is no comprehensive plan to reopen our schools safely.

SEN. TIM KAINE: JOE BIDEN HAS MY VOTE. HE WILL RESTORE CHARACTER, COMPASSION AND COMPETENCE TO OUR NATION

For eight months, we’ve lived through one of the most devastating tragedies in American history. But even as the numbers mount — with the worst-ever day of confirmed new cases coming just days ago — we cannot become numb to it. We cannot let these lives lost and futures diminished become statistics or background noise — just a blur that passes by on the nightly news.

Each is an American life that deserved better. And cruelest of all, we know that so much pain could have been avoided if only the president had faced reality and taken action sooner.

A study released by Columbia University last week found that up to 210,000 American deaths could have been avoided had President Trump mounted even a basic, competent response to the coronavirus pandemic. Choosing instead to lie to us, divide us and promise that the coronavirus pandemic would go away “like a miracle” cost us irreplaceable lives and made our economic collapse far more painful than it ever should have been.

President Trump campaigned in 2016 promising to lift up the forgotten man — but once he took office, he forgot him. He lost sight of working people. Now, not only has he given up on fighting this virus, he’s actively fighting to strip protections away from 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions. He handed out a $1.5 trillion tax giveaway, largely to big corporations and billionaires – but thinks $15 an hour is too much for essential workers.

I see the world from Scranton, Pa. If you grew up around hardworking families like I did, you don’t see Americans who served in uniform, like my son Beau did, as “losers” and “suckers.” And you understand that Wall Street didn’t build this country — working people did.

Americans need a president who sees the world like they do, and treats everyone with dignity and respect. On Day One, I’ll mount an aggressive approach to control this virus and get us back to our lives. I’ll make sure that we don’t just recover from this economic slump, but build back better than before — creating an economy that deals everyone in.

I won’t raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year – but I will make big corporations and the super-wealthy pay their fair share. We’ll use that revenue to get help to schools and small businesses, give educators and essential workers a well-deserved raise, and make health care, child care and elder care more affordable for everyone.

We’ll rebuild manufacturing —by enforcing a real Buy American plan. President Trump made empty promises to American manufacturers that he simply didn’t keep. I’ll require the federal government’s $600 billion in annual purchasing power be used on American companies with American workers, with supply chains running through American towns.

We’ll rebuild our roads, bridges and ports with American steel. We’ll rebuild crumbling schools and construct 1.5 million new affordable homes with American workers. We’ll eliminate the Trump tax loopholes that incentivize companies to move jobs overseas, and forge a future that’s truly made in America. All told, Moody’s Analytics projects that my plan will create 7 million more jobs and $1 trillion more in economic growth than President Trump’s proposals.

But we know that this election is about much more than policy. America’s character is on the ballot.

If elected, I promise to fight as hard for those who don’t support me as for those who do. That’s the job of a president: not to divide us into red states and blue states, but to bring us together in a common purpose — as the United States of America.

This is not a partisan moment. It’s an American moment. And it’s time we pick ourselves up off the mat and come together. If you believe America is better than what we’ve seen these last four years, I hope that you’ll cast your vote for me. Because throughout our history, there has been nothing we’ve been unable to do when we’ve done it together.",,
2020 presidential election ballots cast so far,"Many Americans are voting early in the 2020 presidential election amid concerns regarding the coronavirus pandemic and U.S. Postal Service timing.

More than 94 million total ballots cast as of early Monday morning suggested a record turnout for this year's race compared to the about 50 million early votes cast in the 2016 election, according to data from the United States Elections Project.

That number of early ballots cast so far represents 68.2% of the total national voter turnout in 2016, and the total number of ballots cast includes nearly 60 million mail-in ballots and more than 34 million in-person ballots.

""It appears likely that around 100 million early votes will be cast by the time Tuesday morning reports are processed.,"" said Elections Project founder and University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald in a November 1 blog post on the project website.

McDonald said that he had been predicting for the past year that 2020 would have a record number of voters, estimating 150 million, but that he can now expect even more.

""Examining each state in turn, and rolling up the state estimates to a national estimate, I arrive at a total turnout rate of 160.2 million votes, or a turnout rate for those eligible to vote of 67.0%,"" he wrote.

CLAWING BACK VOTES: 7 STATES ALLOW VOTERS TO RESUBMIT BALLOTS

McDonald noted that in 2016, 40% of voters voted early. That number would have to be higher in 2020, he said, because otherwise, that would mean 250 million people would vote when he estimates that only 239 million are eligible.

""One strong signal is that turnout will be higher than in 2016,"" he said, ""because some states have already exceeded their 2016 turnout or are close to doing so.""

Texas has already surpassed its 2016 voter turnout by 8.3% as of Monday. Montana, Nevada, Washington, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina have surpassed 90% of their turnout four years ago.

California has seen the largest voter turnout so far; more than 11.2 million Californians have cast ballots so far. Texas and Florida trail just behind with 9.7 million and 8.7 million ballots cast, respectively. North Carolina has already recorded 4.5 million ballots cast.

McDonald previously told Fox News that he ""expected some things to be different since states changed their laws"" to accommodate voters amid the pandemic. More than 91 million absentee ballots have been sent to voters so far this year.

FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VOTE CAST USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

""People did not have to take advantage of this,"" he said of mail-in ballots and early voting. But many people already have.

California, however, has recorded the highest number of mail ballot requests at 22 million compared to Florida's 6 million as of Monday morning. Voters in New Jersey have also requested more than 6 million.

Democrats have requested 25 million ballots while Republicans have requested 14.8 million — giving Democrats roughly a 10 million ballot request lead based on data from states reporting party registration including California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Flordia, Iowa, Maryland, Maine, North Carolina, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Utah.

Those ballot requests by party, however, may not be an accurate indicator of final election results, according to McDonald's frequently asked questions page on the Elections Project website.

""Just because registered Democrats are leading Republicans in early voting, that does not mean the Republicans will not make up ground on Election Day,"" McDonald wrote, adding that ""registered Democrats typically lead Republicans during early voting, and Republicans vote on Election Day, a pattern that persists across many states and elections.""

McDonald did note that early voting data indicates that several states, as predicted, will be close. He gave Joe Biden a slight edge in Nevada with President Trump having better odds in North Carolina.

""Florida looks darn close, again,"" he said.

Lil Pump attends Trump rally wearing 'MAGA' hat after declaring his support for the president,"Rapper Lil Pump doubled down on his support of Donald Trump by attending the president’s campaign rally in Florida on Sunday.

The “Gucci Gang” rapper became notoriously pro-Trump after he took a look at Joe Biden’s tax plan and reasoned that he would end up paying more to the federal government under a Biden presidency due to his wealth.

Lil Pump posted two videos to his Instagram Story on Sunday showing that he was in the front row of the president’s recent rally in the swing state. The video opens with an excited-looking Lil Pump sporting a red “Make America Great Again” hat as he listens intently to Trump speak.

He then turns the camera to show the president at the podium during his rally before turning the camera back to himself to emit a gleeful laugh before ending the video. There's no one except what appears to be Secret Service agents between the rapper and the stage, implying he was given a front-row seat to the event.

CHARLIE SHEEN REVEALS SURPRISING ROLE IN RAPPER LIL PUMP'S UPCOMING MUSIC VIDEO

The packed ""Make America Great Again Victory Rally"" took place in Miami-Dade County, which has been described as the coronavirus epicenter in the state. Some wore masks, while others disregarded the face coverings.

In his speech, Trump criticized Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, lockdowns, and insisted the pandemic was ""rounding"" the turn.

Lil Pump’s public support for Trump began last week when the “Be Like Me” artist took to Instagram to share a photoshopped image of himself shaking hands with the president. He captioned the picture, “THE DAY I MET TRUMP #trump202022020.”

RAPPER LIL PUMP SLAMMED FOR RACIST LYRICS, GESTURE IN TEASER VIDEO

The rapper followed up that post with a video shared on his Instagram Story in which he gave an expletive-filled explanation for his endorsement. He insulted the Democratic nominee noting that he takes issue with Biden’s plan to tax wealthy people, a category the artist believes he falls under.

The video, which was shared by multiple social media users despite being removed by Lil Pump, also sees the rapper lambasting “sleepy Joe” and praising his Republican opponent one week before the 2020 race comes to a close.

Twitter flags doctored video purportedly showing Biden addressing wrong state,"A since-deleted doctored video of 2020 Democratic nominee Joe Biden made the rounds on Twitter over the weekend.

'DECEPTIVELY EDITED' VIDEO CLAIMING TRUMP IS 'DISORIENTED' SLAMMED AS FALSE AFTER IT GOES VIRAL

""The Tweet ... was labeled in line with our Synthetic and Manipulated Media policy,"" a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News. After Twitter labeled the video to indicate that it was manipulated media, the user who originally posted the video deleted it, the spokesperson added.

Minnesota state Rep. Kurt Daudt shared the doctored video -- in which a sign was altered to read, ""Tampa, Florida,"" instead of ""Minnesota,"" where the video was first recorded -- on Twitter.

""Rep. Daudt, as you hopefully know by now, you're sharing a manipulated video,"" local journalist Tony Webster replied. ""Biden was speaking in Minnesota, not Florida. Do you really not recognize the Minnesota State Fairgrounds? The 4-H Building is clearly in the background.""

It's not the first time Twitter users have spread manipulated media videos on the platform against Twitter's policies.

Biden has polling edge over Trump in key battlegrounds on election eve,"On Election eve, President Trump faces challenging poll numbers but remains confident of pulling off a second straight come-from-behind victory.

“We're going to win four more great years in the White House,” Trump predicted as he spoke to supporters in Georgia on Sunday night.

But the latest public opinion polls appear to tell a different story.

WHAT THE FINAL FOX NEWS NATIONAL POLL SHOWS IN THE BIDEN-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll conducted Thursday through Saturday indicated Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden holding a 10-point (52%-46%) lead over Trump. And a survey conducted for Investor’s Business Daily (IBD/TIPP) pointed to a three-point (49%-46%) advantage for the former vice president over Trump, with third-party candidates grabbing 3%.

A Fox News National poll conducted last week showed the president trailing Biden by eight points, 52%-44%. An average of all final polls on the eve of the election compiled by Real Clear Politics puts Biden up 6.9 points over the president. The margins are slightly narrowing. Biden was up 8.9 points over the president in the Real Clear Politics average two weeks ago, and ahead by 7.8 points a week ago.

The current national polling deficit for Trump is bigger than the one he faced against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at this time in the presidential election four years ago. On the eve of the 2016 election, Clinton held a 3.2-point advantage over Trump, according to an average compiled by Real Clear Politics. Clinton ended up winning the national popular vote by two points.

WHAT THE FINAL FOX NEWS BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS SHOW IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

But it's the states and their electoral votes that decide who wins the White House -- and thanks to victories in six key battleground states that he flipped from blue to red, Trump trounced Clinton in the Electoral College vote to win the White House.

Fast-forward four years and Biden has a slight edge in many of the key battlegrounds, according to an average of the final public opinion surveys in the swing states.

The president and top Trump re-election campaign officials have repeatedly dismised most public opinion surveys, saying their own internal polls show a different story.

Trump campaign senior adviser David Bossie told 'Fox and Friends' on Monday morning that the public surveys ""didn't capture the hidden Trump voter.""

And he predicted that ""we are going to see our people come out in droves.""

Here's a look at where the final polls stand in the key battleground states where the presidential election will be won.

Pennsylvania

Of all of the battlegrounds, Pennsylvania may be the most crucial – and is getting the most candidate traffic in the final stretch.

“Pennsylvanians who haven’t voted yet – we need every one of you to vote,” Biden implored at a drive-in car rally in Philadelphia Sunday night. “Pennsylvania is critical to this election.”

Four years ago, Trump became the first Republican nominee to win Pennsylvania since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Trump carried the state -- and its 20 electoral votes. An average of the final surveys on election eve indicated Clinton with 2.1-point edge over Trump, but he outperformed the polls, winning in the Keystone State by seven-tenths of 1%.

This time, the Biden campaign has heavily concentrated on Pennsylvania, the former vice president’s native state. During his nearly four decades in the Senate representing Delaware, Biden was known as Pennsylvania’s third senator.

An average of the final surveys indicates Biden with a 4.3-point edge over the president. Trump campaigned in the Keystone State on Saturday and returns Monday. Besides the former vice president’s events in the state on Sunday, Biden, running mate Sen. Kamala Harris and their spouses are fanning out across the state all day on the eve of the election.

Florida

With 29 electoral votes up for grabs, Florida is the largest of the traditional battlegrounds.

Twenty years ago it was the state that decided the presidential election between then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. President Bush won the state by five points in his 2004 reelection.

Barack Obama carried the state by razor-thin margins in 2008 and 2012. But four years ago, Trump narrowly edged Clinton by 1.2 points to flip the state from blue to red.

An average of the final polls in the state shows Biden with a razor-thin, 1-point edge over the president.

Biden and Trump held dueling rallies in the Sunshine State on Thursday. And Trump returned for a large, late-night rally on Sunday. Biden’s most popular surrogate – former President Obama – closes out his campaigning in Miami on Monday.

Many political analysts and pundits say that Florida’s a must-win state for the president. Biden told his supporters in the state that “you hold the key. If Florida goes blue, it’s over.”

Wisconsin

Like Pennsylvania, Trump in 2016 broke the Democrats' quarter-century winning streak in Wisconsin with a narrow victory over Clinton. An average of the final polls indicated Clinton ahead by 6.5 points, but Trump carried the state by seven-tenths of a percent.

Fast forward to today, and as is the case in Pennsylvania, Trump is underperforming with key constituencies in the Badger State, including suburban voters. Also working against the president is a new wave of coronavirus, which has hit Wisconsin particularly hard.

An average of the most recent polls in Wisconsin gives Biden a 6.6-point advantage in the battle for the state’s 10 electoral votes. Clinton famously didn’t set foot in Wisconsin in the general election. Biden made sure he didn’t make the same mistake, repeatedly campaigning in the state. So has Trump, and the president returns to Wisconsin on the eve of the election.

Michigan

Democrats carried Michigan for a quarter-century in presidential elections until Trump narrowly won the state four years ago.

Clinton was up in an average of the final polls by 3.6 points, but Trump won the state by three-tenths of 1%.

But the president's support among White, working-class voters doesn't appear to be matching the 2016 levels, and Black turnout, which was down four years ago, appears to be reenergized.

An average of the final public opinion polls gives Biden a 5.1-point lead in the battle for the state's 16 electoral votes.

Biden teamed up with Obama for two stops in Michigan on Saturday.

The night before the election in 2016, Trump's final campaign rally went past midnight in Grand Rapids, Mich. Hoping to repeat history, the president’s once gain making Grand Rapids his stop in the 2020 campaign.

Arizona

Arizona has long backed Republicans in presidential elections.

Bill Clinton in 1996 became the only Democrat to win the state since 1952. But Trump carried the state by just 3 points four years ago.

As with Florida, the president’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic appears to be doing him no favors with the state’s crucial senior voters.

An average of the final polls shows Biden with a razor-thin, 1-point edge over Trump in the fight for the state’s 11 electoral votes.

North Carolina

North Carolina has seen plenty of candidate traffic in recent weeks, and its airwaves are being flooded with ads.

Obama carried the state in 2008 by a razor-thin margin over Republican John McCain. Four years later, GOP nominee Mitt Romney won the state’s 15 electoral votes by roughly 2 percentage points over Obama.

Polls on the eve of the 2016 presidential election indicated Trump held a 0.8-point edge over Hillary Clinton. Trump ended up winning the state by 3.6 points.

On the eve of this election, an average of the polls compiled by Real Clear Politics indicates Trump with a 0.6-point edge over Biden. The president makes North Carolina his first campaign stop on Monday.

Ohio

Biden called a last-minute audible and added a trip to Cleveland on Monday, making Ohio his first top on election eve. An average of the final polls in the Buckeye State indicates Trump with a 0.2-point edge over Biden.

Ohio has long played a crucial role in presidential elections. It was the state that famously put President George W. Bush over the top in 2004 for a second term.

Obama narrowly carried the state in 2008 and 2012. Four years ago, it appeared it would be another close contest, with an average of the polls on the eve of the election putting Trump narrowly ahead. But Trump ended up swamping Clinton by eight points, flipping the state and winning Ohio’s 18 electoral votes.

Trump's margin of victory was the largest by any presidential candidate in nearly three decades.

In the 2020 race, Ohio was expected to remain solidly Republican. But the race has tightened amid the pandemic and both campaigns heavily invested in the state in the closing weeks.

Iowa

Obama carried Iowa by 6 points in 2012, but Trump flipped the Hawkeye State four years ago, topping Clinton by 9 points even though the final surveys suggested a much closer margin.

As with Ohio, it wasn't on the battleground radar a year ago.

But Iowa's very much in the spotlight now, with an average of the final polls in the state showing Trump with a 0.7-point edge over Biden.

Georgia

Southerner Bill Clinton in 1992 was the last Democrat to carry Georgia in a presidential election.

Long a red state, Georgia tightened in the 2016 election when Trump captured the state’s 16 electoral votes by just 5 points. The president, apparently playing some defense, recently campaigned in the state and returned on Sunday. Biden made his first general election trip to the state earlier this week.

An average of the final polls indicates Biden with a 0.4-point edge.

Nevada

President George W. Bush in 2004 was the last GOP standard-bearer to win Nevada. But Clinton narrowly edged Trump by 2 points four years ago, and Trump’s eyeing to flip the Silver State.

Both campaigns have invested time, money and resources in the state in the battle for its six electoral votes.

An average of the final surveys in the state indicates Biden with a 3.6-point advantage over the president.

Minnesota

President Richard Nixon was the last Republican to win the state – during his 1972 landslide reelection.

Four years ago, Trump narrowly lost Minnesota and its 10 electoral votes to Clinton, and for over a year the president and his reelection campaign have been eyeing the state in hopes of breaking the GOP's losing streak.

An average of the final polls in the state gives Biden a 4.3-point advantage over Trump, but the surveys suggest that Trump has gained ground over the past month.

The presidential nominees held dueling rallies in Minnesota on Friday.

Texas

It’s been nearly a half-century since a Democrat won Texas in a presidential election: former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter in 1976.

But the longtime ruby-red state has become more competitive in recent years.

Trump won Texas and its whopping 38 electoral votes by 9 points in the 2016 election, down from Romney's 16-point win over Obama in 2012.

Barrett speaks in first Supreme Court oral arguments since joining court,"Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked her first questions during oral arguments on Monday, in a remote hearing on a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case.

Barrett was the last of the justices to speak Monday as they grill lawyers in descending order of seniority to preserve order in the teleconference hearings during the pandemic. Before the arguments began, Chief Justice John Roberts said that it was his ""great pleasure"" to welcome his new colleague and wished her ""a long and happy career in our common calling.""

The first case Barrett and the rest of the justices heard Monday morning was U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services v. Sierra Club. That case centers around granular administrative law on what exactly the government is required to disclose in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.

""You said that if a government official simply stamps 'draft' on it and sent it over, and as Justice Kavanaugh is positing did so in order to avoid FOIA disclosure requirements, you said that a court might look at other factors to determine whether it's still final,"" Barrett said in her first question as a justice. ""What other factors would a court consider?""

TRUMP ALREADY CHOSE BARRETT SUCCESSOR ON APPEALS COURT, CONFIRMATION POSSIBLE REGARDLESS OF ELECTION OUTCOME

In the FOIA-related case the court heard Monday, the government disputes that it must turn over some draft documents that it claims fall under the ""deliberative process privilege"" exemption of the Freedom of Information Act.

The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, argues that those documents should be available to the public.

""[The government's] view of Exemption 5 suggests that materials FOIA explicitly makes public—interpretations, staff instructions, and policies with operative effect on later agency decisions—should, contrary to the statute, largely be secret,"" Sierra Club said in a brief.

In response to Barrett's first question, the government's counsel argued that a court could investigate whether the label of ""draft"" was ""pretextual."" He added that in such an examination he believed the government would succeed in this particular case.

Barrett responded that such an investigation would be ""a pretty fact-intensive determination.""

As the conversation continued, she asked the government lawyer to clarify that its position is ""your first order of preference would be the kind of formalistic line that I was just describing and then your backup argument would be if the court was uncomfortable about the possibility of avoiding FOIA obligations by simply stamping draft at the top that we go with the more kind of multi-factor, fact-specific test, you know maybe to see was the agency holding this out as a final opinion?""

The government lawyer said that was an accurate characterization of its argument.

When Barrett questioned the lawyer for Sierra Club, she first asked him to clarify an exchange that came with Justice Stephen Breyer.

TRUMP VS. BIDEN ON THE SUPREME COURT: WHERE THEY STAND

""You identified the biological opinion which is almost never issued, the draft biological opinion, which is available by regulation and the draft of the draft, which the government said this was. Is it true that the draft biological opinion, that second one in the hierarchy, is always FIOA-able and that there's no controversy about that?"" Barrett asked.

The Sierra Club lawyer said that there is still some controversy on the issue.

Barrett followed up by asking the Sierra Club lawyer to distinguish between the practical and legal effects of the documents at issue.

""Why was it a legal effect as opposed to simply a practical effect when having this document caused the EPA to abandon the 2013 regulation and then move on to the 2014 regulation?"" she said.

Barrett then interrupted the counsel's answer to that question and said: ""If the EPA simply got wind ... of what the services were thinking and said, 'well, it doesn't look like this is going to be on a good track for us' ... and so abandoned it, that seems to be a practical consequence.""

She followed up: ""How can a draft opinion give rise to that legal consequence?""

Barrett on Monday is also hearing arguments -- along with the rest of the court -- in another low-profile case, Salinas v. Railroad Retirement Board.

Things will heat up Wednesday and into next week, however, as the court gets into cases on more hot-button issues. On Wednesday the Supreme Court will hear Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is a case about whether or not a city can prevent a religious group that does not place foster children with same-sex couples from participating in its foster program.

Then on Nov. 9, the court will hear a case on immigration, and on Nov. 10 it will hear Texas v. California, the case about the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that loomed large over Barrett's confirmation process.

Celebrities who said they'll leave America if President Trump is reelected,"For as long as there have been elections, there have been high-profile people threatening to leave the country if the race doesn’t go their way.

The 2020 presidential race is no exception. Although stars like Lena Dunham, Jon Stewart, Samuel L. Jackson and countless others previously made the empty promise to ditch the United States if Donald Trump became president in 2016, the 2020 race is perhaps even more contentious in the minds of Hollywood stars. In fact, Trump himself has joked that he may have to leave the country if his opponent, Joe Biden, wins.

With Election Day just hours away, stars seem to be hedging their bets so as not to have egg on their face when they inevitably decide to stick around regardless of the outcome. Still, a handful of celebrities have claimed that they’ll flee the United States in the event that the president is reelected:

Bruce Springsteen

The “Born in the U.S.A.” singer has been a vocal opponent of Trump throughout his administration, having used his E Street Radio program on SiriusXM to lambaste the administration several times in the past. However, the 71-year-old rocker recently told the Australian press that he will move to their country rather than endure a second Trump term in the United States.

CELEBRITIES REACT TO TRUMP AND BIDEN'S DUAL TOWN HALLS

When first asked whether he'd ever consider a move to Australia, Springsteen said, ""I would consider that,"" according to the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail.

""I love Australia,"" he continued. ""Every time we have nothing but good times down there. It’s always a treat to come. Love the people, love the geography, great place for motorcycle trips, it’s close to our hearts.""

He added: ‘If Trump is reelected – which he will not be; I’m predicting right now he’s gonna lose – if by some happenstance he should be, I’ll see you on the next plane.”

Tommy Lee

The Motley Crue drummer promised to leave the United States if Trump beats Democrat Joe Biden in the upcoming election as well.

Speaking to The Big Issue, he noted that he plans to go back to Greece, where he was born, in the event the election doesn’t go his way.

“Dude, I swear to God if that happens, then I’m coming over to visit the U.K. I’m out of here,"" Lee said. ""I’ll go back to my motherland, go back to go Greece and get a house on one of the islands.""

He added that he believes the Trump administration has made the country look bad in the eyes of the rest of the world.

“The thing that stings the most is that I feel like we’re embarrassing,"" Lee said. ""I feel like people in Europe and the rest of the world look at America and think: ‘What the f--k are you guys doing over there? Stop voting for celebrities and get someone real to run the country.'”

The declaration isn’t surprising given how often Lee has spoken out against the president, specifically on the topic of the coronavirus. When it came to light that the president and the first lady had tested positive for COVID-19, he tweeted that it was an act of karma. Prior to that, he took Trump to task over his handling of the wildfires in California in 2018, which have only gotten worse over time.

Ricky Martin

The Latino pop star is very public about his support for Biden, having previously appeared at a campaign event for the candidate in Miami.

“I’ve been supporting Biden forever,” the “Livin’ La Vida Loca” hitmaker says on an upcoming episode of the Variety and iHeart podcast “The Big Ticket.” “I think he is the only option we have and he is great and he has been in politics all his life. This is the moment. We all need to get together and be loud about the course of this nation.”

In the same interview, Martin revealed that he and his husband, artist Jwan Yosef, made plans to leave the country if Trump wins reelection. However, he stopped short of promising to do so, noting that he now plans to stick around and fight against a second term if it comes to it.

“I think when you have 50 million people voting already, it’s because we are not the only ones concerned about this and for that I am extremely happy,” Martin explained. “We just take it one day at a time and we’ve had plans like we might leave the country, but no. We have to stay here and we have to fight for our rights and what we believe.”

John Legend and Chrissy Teigen

After being at the receiving end of a negative tweet from the president in 2019, Legend spoke to Cosmopolitan U.K. revealing that he and his wife considered leaving the United States because of Trump.

“Every once in a while you think about it,"" the singer told the outlet. ""We were born and raised here, all of our families are here. It would be hard to leave. But I don’t know what one’s supposed to do when you have a leader who is trying to destroy democracy.""

He added: “At some point, if that project [to destroy democracy] was to be in any way successful, you’d have to think about going somewhere that is a true democracy, that has respect for the rule of law and human rights.

""If America chooses to be that place then people will have to start thinking about going somewhere else. It is truly disturbing and concerning.""

The singer noted, however, that he’s optimistic about Biden winning the election.

“I’m not nervous. I strongly believe America is exhausted from three and a half years of Donald Trump. Exhausted from the daily efforts to destroy democracy and the free press,” he said. “I think his handling of the [COVID-19] pandemic has been embarrassing to the entire nation and has caused so much loss of life, that was preventable. I think people are just exhausted and ready for new leadership: sane leadership, empathetic leadership. Joe Biden can bring that to the country. We can’t bear another four years of this.”",,
"Trump, Biden campaign lawyers ready to pounce for election legal battle","Less than 24 hours until Election Day, the Trump and Biden campaigns are winding down their rigorous battles fought via ad campaigns, debates and rallies, while digging in for a whole new war, this one to be waged in courtrooms.

Both sides have amassed their battalions of attorneys, and it appears that they will not wait long to engage.

FEDERAL COURT TO HEAR REPUBLICAN BID TO TOSS 127,000 BALLOTS IN TEXAS

“We're going to go in [the] night of, as soon as that election is over, we're going in with our lawyers,” President Trump told reporters Sunday, referring to litigation over whether ballots in swing states such as Pennsylvania and North Carolina should be counted if they arrive in the mail after Election Day.

""I don't think it's fair that we have to wait a long period of time after the election. Should've gotten their ballots in a long time before that. Could've gotten their ballots in a month ago. I think it's a ridiculous decision,” the president said, referring to the Supreme Court’s decision not to block state court orders that allowed extensions.

Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said Sunday that she expects the “overwhelming majority” of ballots to be tallied in a few days’ time, but whether all of those votes will ultimately count will depend on how the ongoing court case plays out. She confirmed that ballots received after Election Day will be segregated from the rest, just in case they are ruled invalid.

To handle this and other legal matters, Trump’s campaign has formed what it has called “Lawyers for Trump,” a coalition to “protect the integrity” of the election.

The coalition is being led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, as well as California Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon and former Deputy White House Counsel Stefan Passantino. The group includes prominent Trump-allied attorneys like former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, former Attorney General Ed Meese and the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS IT WILL TAKE 'DAYS' TO COUNT 'OVERWHELMING MAJORITY' OF VOTES

The Lawyers for Trump coalition comes as part of the joint Republican National Committee and Trump campaign's ""Protect the Vote"" effort, which has warned for months that ""Democrats are trying to use coronavirus and the courts to legalize ballot harvesting, implement a nationwide mail-in ballot system, and eliminate nearly every safeguard in our elections.""

Trump campaign general counsel Matthew Morgan told Fox News in October that the campaign is urging active and retired attorneys and even law students to volunteer in their nationwide efforts.

“Democrats are working to shred election integrity measures one state at a time, and there’s no question they’ll continue their shenanigans from now to November and beyond,” Morgan told Fox News. “The Trump campaign is fighting to ensure every valid ballot across America counts – once.”

The Biden campaign, meanwhile, has been quietly building a massive ""election protection program,"" including former Attorney General Eric Holder and hundreds of other lawyers in preparation for a legal battle in the event of a contested election.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN SUES IN NEVADA TO STOP VEGAS-AREA VOTE COUNT

The campaign said this team includes Bob Bauer, who has signed on full-time as a senior campaign adviser while on leave from the faculty of NYU Law School. Bauer, who served as general counsel to the Obama-Biden campaigns in 2008 and 2012 and co-chair of former President Obama's Presidential Commission on Election Administration, will work alongside the campaign’s general counsel, Dana Remus.

Remus has oversight of the campaign’s day-to-day legal operations, and will oversee the wide-ranging team of lawyers to address voter protection.

A national team for special litigation features former Solicitors General Donald Verrilli and Walter Dellinger, and a team at the law firm Perkins Coie, which is headed by Marc Elias. Perkins Coie played a key role in Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, and it was Elias who Fusion GPS, the firm that conducted opposition research that ultimately included Christopher Steele’s dossier.

The Biden team's lawyers will focus state-by-state on protecting voter access to the polls and a “fair and accurate vote count.”

Democrats and Republicans are each claiming the other side is looking to rig the 2020 election in their favor, with accusations largely stemming from mail-in voting, which is being utilized to an unprecedented degree as a precaution to allow voters to avoid crowds during the coronavirus pandemic.

Democrats claim that by opposing special measures to accommodate large-scale mail-in voting, Republicans are looking to disenfranchise American voters. As long as they submit their votes by Election Day, their votes should count, even if they do not arrive until several days later, they argue.

MAINE COURT CITES VOTER FRAUD CONCERN IN RULING AGAINST PUSH FOR BALLOT HARVESTING, ABSENTEE EXTENSION

Boockvar noted that it would be nothing new to have ballots counted after Election Day, as military votes are normally not received until days later. States have different deadlines for when service members’ ballots must be received. According to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, Pennsylvania ballots must be signed by voters by 11:59 p.m. Monday, the day before Election Day, and arrive no later than 5 p.m. on the seventh day after Election Day.

For civilian voters in Pennsylvania, the law had been that the state Board of Elections ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Democrats challenged this, seeking an injunction to allow ballots to be accepted up to three days later, as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3. They claimed that this was necessary because during this year’s primary election, “at least tens of thousands of voters ultimately did not receive their ballots with enough time to return them by the close of the polls on Election Day.”

The State Supreme Court granted the extension, leading Republicans to seek review from the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that it is up to the legislature, not the court, to set election rules. The U.S. Supreme Court has yet to take up the case, but they denied a request to put the state court’s ruling on hold.

A similar case is being litigated in North Carolina, where the deadline has been pushed to a week after Election Day.

Republicans have claimed that Democrats are trying to change existing rules for their benefit. Trump has claimed that large-scale mail-in voting is not as secure as in-person, and leaves the system open to fraud. While clear cases of fraudulent behavior have yet to be proven thus far, the system has shown to be problematic in some instances, such as when more than 100 undelivered absentee ballots were found in a Kentucky dumpster.

While Pennsylvania sided with Democrats, courts in states like Maine have denied pushes to extend ballot deadlines.

“A judicial declaration that the statutory deadline is not really a deadline at all, and can be altered and extended for a week or more, risks undermining voter confidence that the law means what it says and that the voting and the election are over,” Maine Superior Court Justice William Stokes wrote in an order.

Colin Reed: 4 signs Trump and the Republican Party are in big trouble this Election Day,"The inevitability around an expected Hillary Clinton presidency in early November 2016 is eerily similar to the mood ahead of a presumed Joe Biden White House in early November 2020.

While four years ago all the pieces fell into place for candidate Donald Trump, this time the political winds are blowing directly into the incumbent’s face.

Specifically, Trump faces an ominous four-headed monster as campaign 2020’s hourglass winds down – factors that will reverberate down-ballot into Senate races.

First, Trump is playing electoral college defense in traditionally red states he cannot afford to lose. Given their blue tilt, Trump’s “Big Three” coalition of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin was always going to be difficult to replicate.

DONALD TRUMP: REELECT ME AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER SAFETY, PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS

Now, he faces deficits in Florida and Arizona by three and six points, respectively, according to the latest polls from the New York Times and Siena College. Georgia and North Carolina are both legitimate jump balls, and even Texas moved to the “toss up” column by Cook Political Report.

Biden’s basement strategy may have earned him mockery from his opponents, but it has paid political dividends. It allowed the campaign to be framed as a referendum on Trump, not the choice election that the Trump team wanted.

Count me skeptical that 2020 is the year the Lone Star state goes blue, but Trump’s already-precarious pathway all but vanishes should even one of these states flip.

Compounding Trump’s troubles with the electoral map is his second major challenge: Biden is swamping Trump’s boat financially.

The challenger entered October with almost three times more cash on hand than the incumbent – $63.1 million to $177.3 million. During the final weekend, Biden enjoyed a nearly three to one advantage over Trump in television advertising. TV buys aren’t everything, but it complicates the ability to drive a message in an ever-expanding electoral map.

Third, the COVID-19 pandemic is cresting at the worst possible moment. The country recorded 99,000 new cases Friday – a new high-water mark. Last week saw a record-setting 559,000 new infections.

JOE BIDEN: I WANT YOUR VOTE TO BECOME YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT — HERE’S WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU AND OUR NATION

Aside from the human toll, the pandemic is undermining Trump’s political strengths elsewhere. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all suffered their worst weeks since March – all while Americans were casting early ballots in record numbers. Even if pandemic-driven, rocky markets undermine Trump’s economic message, long an area voters have consistently preferred him over Biden.

Finally, and most importantly, Biden is not Hillary Clinton. His approval numbers are right at 50 percent, according to Real Clear Politics, with his unfavorable marks sitting at 44. Clinton, by contrast, entered election day 2016 with her favorability 12 points underwater, 42-54 percent.

Biden’s basement strategy may have earned him mockery from his opponents, but it has paid political dividends. It allowed the campaign to be framed as a referendum on Trump, not the choice election that the Trump team wanted. Hunter Biden’s emails made some noise but never reached the decibel level of Hillary Clinton’s.

At 77 years old, Biden was not perfect, and he had his fair share of head-scratching moments. His big mouth has long been his greatest political liability, but on his third and final attempt at the White House, he managed to keep it in check.

Meanwhile, in the battle for the Senate, the GOP’s hopes of maintaining their three-seat majority are inextricably linked with Trump. Split ticket voters are nearly extinct these days, making life very difficult for Republican incumbents in blue states.

If Trump is able to keep things close in purple places like Iowa, North Carolina and Arizona, the GOP Senators on the ballot have a chance, and those in the redder states of Montana, Texas and Kansas can breathe a little easier.

If it’s a rout at the presidential level, Joe Biden can look forward to full Democratic control of the levers of government. Georgia remains the big wild card, with both Senate seats up for grabs, and both potentially heading to January run-off elections should no candidate hit the 50 percent mark tomorrow.

With little left to do except count the votes, anyone would rather be in Joe Biden’s shoes than Trump’s. We’ve seen this movie before, and know how it ended then. If Trump can somehow pull another rabbit out of his hat, it will be a greater political feat than even his remarkable 2016 victory.

"‘No climb’ fence to be installed around White House, source says","With Election Day preparations in full swing across the country, the White House will have a “no climb” fence installed this week around the entire complex, a law enforcement source told Fox News on Monday.

A similar fence already exists around Lafayette Park and parts of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House for Inauguration Day construction.

Such fencing was also used around the White House over the summer following unrest over the death of George Floyd. Those fences ranged from seven feet to more than nine feet high.

The precautions come during one of the most contentious presidential elections in recent memory and concerns over possible unrest in the wake of Tuesday's results.

DC Metro Police Chief Peter Newsham said Thursday there were no “credible threats right now of violence,” but said several groups had applied for permits to conduct large demonstrations and the entire police department would be working on Election Day.

Just blocks away from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, businesses such as hair salons, restaurants, clothing stores, and banks were boarded up Sunday. Wells Fargo, CVS Pharmacy and the Washington Sports Club were among some of the business with plywood protecting their windows.

"Update: Pa. bakery's 'cookie poll,' which has predicted past elections, is now showing clear frontrunner","The official tally isn’t in just yet, but one candidate can safely claim victory in a Pennsylvania bakery’s cookie poll.

Lochel’s, a family-owned bakery located in the town of Hatboro, tells Fox News that the shop’s Trump-themed cookies are “vastly” outselling its Biden-themed cookies by a margin of almost 6 to 1, with some customers driving from neighboring states in order to get their hands on the treats.

“We had one guy drive twice from Staten Island for them,” said bakery owner Kathleen Lochel.

What’s more, Kathleen had previously touted that the informal “cookie poll” — which she’s held for the past four election cycles — has accurately predicted the outcome of the last three elections.

After her final tally on Tuesday night, however, Kathleen says she’ll stop counting up the cookie sales — even if the actual election drags on for days past Nov. 3. The bakery, however, will continue to bake the limited-edition cookies for customers who currently have outstanding orders.

“This is definitely by far the busiest we’ve ever been,” Kathleen says, adding that demand for the cookies have “superseded” anything they’ve seen before — including the week leading up to Christmas, which is generally their busiest time of year.

Lochel’s doesn’t plan on taking any breaks after the election, either. In addition to fulfilling the back orders, Kathleen will be debuting a ""celebratory"" cookie in honor of the winner, with special sweets planned in the event of either a Trump or Biden victory.

"Sean Connery ‘put me at ease’ during bed scene in ‘Never Say Never Again,’ former Bond girl Valerie Leon says","Former Bond girl Valerie Leon has fond memories of working alongside Sean Connery.

The charismatic Scottish actor who rose to international stardom as suave secret agent James Bond and later led a successful decades-long career in Hollywood passed away on Oct. 31 at age 90.

Leon, who played the Lady in Bahamas in 1983’s “Never Say Never Again,” revealed on U.K.’s “This Morning” on Monday that the legendary star put her at ease when it came time to film a romantic scene in bed.

“I did have this bed scene with him which I was quite worried about,” admitted the 76-year-old, as quoted by U.K.’s DailyMail.

SEAN CONNERY'S WIDOW REVEALS HE BATTLED DEMENTIA BEFORE HIS DEATH

“Despite my age, I had never done a bed scene on film, that’s for sure,” she continued. “So I was quite worried about that, but he did put me at ease for it.”

Leon shared that Connery jumped out of bed immediately once his wife Micheline Roquebrune arrived on set.

“Filming does take a long time and he is a perfectionist,” she said. “He did stay in bed all morning. However, when his wife came in the afternoon to watch, he could not get out of bed quick enough! He was the world’s greatest sex symbol so no wonder I was worried about going to bed with the world’s greatest sex symbol but he put me at ease.

“We did share some fun times together -- he was an incredible man,” the actress added.

“Oh there’s no question -- Sean made Bond and Bond made Sean,” she explained. “He was an extraordinary actor and went on to do lots of other parts. he was an extraordinary man, that’s for sure.”

Connery’s wife and two sons said the star “died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by family” in the Bahamas, where he lived. Son Jason Connery said his father had been “unwell for some time.”

Connery was in his early 30s — and little known — when he starred in the first Bond thriller, 1962’s “Dr. No,” based on the Ian Fleming novel.

Condemned as immoral by the Vatican and the Kremlin, but screened at the White House for Bond fan John F. Kennedy, “Dr. No” was a box office hit and launched a franchise that long outlasted its Cold War origins.

United Artists couldn’t wait to make more films about the British secret agent, with ever more elaborate stunts and gadgets, along with more exotic locales and more prominent co-stars, among them Lotte Lenya and Jill St. John.

Connery continued as Bond in “From Russia With Love,” “Goldfinger,” “Thunderball,” “You Only Live Twice” and “Diamonds Are Forever,” often performing his own stunts.

Connery is survived by his wife, brother Neil and sons Jason and Stefan. His publicist, Nancy Seltzer, said there would be a private ceremony followed by a memorial service once the coronavirus pandemic has ended.

Voting amid coronavirus: Tips to stay safe on Election Day,"Millions will head to the polls on Tuesday to cast their vote in person which has the potential for large crowds or other less-than-ideal conditions amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which released a case report last month calling for stronger mitigation measures at the polls, has posted updated guidance to help voters and poll workers stay safe on Election Day.

“The more an individual interacts with others, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread,” the CDC wrote. “Elections with only in-person voting on a single day are higher risk for COVID-19 spread because there will be larger crowds and longer wait times. Lower risk election polling settings include those with: a wide variety of voting options, longer voting periods (more days and/or more hours, any other feasible options for reducing the number of voters who congregate indoors in polling locations at the same time.”

While the main route of transmission for COVID-19 is through respiratory outlets, numerous studies have shown that it may be possible to contract the illness by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching the face, nose or possibly even eyes. Handwashing, staying home when sick, cleaning and disinfection are all mitigation measures that should be used on Election Day, the health agency advises.

CORONAVIRUS TRANSMISSION AT HOME 'COMMON,' OVER 50% HOUSEHOLD CONTACTS INFECTED, CDC FINDS

Election officials and poll workers can also help stifle spread by staying home if they are sick or had recent close contact with a person with COVID-19. Providing hand sanitizer at the polls for each step in the voting process, and placing it in a visible location can also help promote disinfecting measures, as can regularly cleaning and disinfecting voting equipment. Encouraging poll workers to wash their hands frequently and to cover coughs and sneezes can also help keep the environments safe, the CDC advises.

“Recommend and reinforce the use of masks among all workers,” the CDC advises. “Masks are most essential in times when physical distancing is difficult. Information should be provided to workers on proper use, removal and washing of masks.”

It’s also recommended that workers encourage voters to use masks, and when the need for mask removal arises to place a plastic barrier between the voter and the poll worker. Voters should also be reminded of the importance of social distancing with the aid of signs or other visual cues such as floor markings.

BILLIONS OF POLITICAL TEXTS SENT IN 2020 ELECTION'S FINAL PUSH

Crowd and line management may also play an important role in slowing the spread should an infected person enter the polling area. The CDC recommends increasing the number of polling locations available for early voting and extending the hours of operation, as well as maintaining or increasing the number of polling places available to the public on Election Day.

Once inside, increasing distance between voting booths and modifying the location layout to ensure voters move in one direction can help, as can encouraging those who plan to vote in-person to do so during off-peak times.

In order to protect those most at risk for severe illness, polling locations previously set up at nursing homes or long-term care facilities should be moved. They should also be set up separate from other facility users.

Voters are encouraged to check voting location and requirements in advance to cut down on time spent at the polls, and if necessary, to complete registration forms before arriving to vote.

Bringing your own black pen or a stylus to use at a touchscreen voting machine can also be helpful.

"Ways to reduce Election Day stress, anxiety","With an uptick in the number of Americans seeking professional help due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, many are concerned about the role that a contentious presidential election may play in our nation’s well-being. There are several ways to calm anxiety and fears heading into Tuesday, one expert said, including practicing mindfulness in the days beforehand.

“Practicing mindfulness and connecting your mind and body through activities such as yoga, journaling or going for a walk can be especially beneficial right now to alleviate stress,” Dr. Barbara Nosal, PhD, LMFG, LADC, and chief clinical officer at Newport Institute, told Fox News. “Exercise can also help alleviate stress because it releases endorphins which can make you feel more positive.”

Limiting social media, especially if it tends to rile up the emotions, is also a good idea, Nosal said.

CORONAVIRUS, ELECTION STRESS IMPACTING NATION'S MENTAL HEALTH, PSYCHOLOGISTS WARN

“Social media use during high-stress events can often lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, insomnia, isolation and fatigue,” Nosal said. “’Doomscrolling’ can often occur in scenarios like this when we are surrounded by and continuously reading or scrolling through bad news, even when it is disheartening or depressing.”

HEAVY MEDIA MULTITASKING ASSOCIATED WITH POOR MEMORY, STUDY FINDS

Replacing the scrolling and unfiltered opinions of others with a positive activity, like listening to music that brings you joy or watching a movie or reading a book, can also help alleviate the stress and feelings of anxiousness.

And when you do check in on the results, be sure to “consider the source of your information,” Nosal said.

“One key to your wellness is staying present and grounded in the moment by focusing on what you can control,” Nosal said. “We can control our one vote, but the election results are out of our control.”

She added that once your vote is cast, “recognize the need to let it go and resist putting energy into the outcome given you cannot change it.”",,
Former Gov. Scott Walker: Donald Trump has the better economic plan and record – and my vote,"Who do you want in charge of the economy? There will be a COVID vaccine soon – the question is whether it will be out yet this year or later in 2021. Either way, the global pandemic will be largely a non-issue a year from now.

With that in mind, the real question is who has the better plan and the better record to get America working again? Donald Trump wins in a landslide when applying that criteria to this election.

The Great American Comeback is real under President Donald Trump. The American economy grew at the fastest pace ever recorded in the third quarter, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. And, as usual, it was higher than economists had predicted, which sets an even more positive trend for the future. President Trump knows how to get people back to work.

GIANNO CALDWELL: WHY TRUMP'S REELECTION MAY BE A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR AMERICA'S BLACK COMMUNITY

Before coronavirus hit, America had recorded the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. Unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, people with disabilities, and veterans were all the lowest ever recorded by category. And women’s share of payroll employment surpassed that of men.

Under President Trump, real household median income hit the highest level ever recorded at $65,000. And the president’s policies have increased real disposable income per household by almost $6,000.

The Trump administration eliminated costly and unnecessary regulations on small businesses and other employers. These efforts are projected to increase household income by $3,100 per year. Additionally, the promotion of energy exploration and production in resources like shale energy are expected to save American families an average of $2,500 in gasoline costs. That’s real money.

Prior to the global pandemic, nearly half a million manufacturing jobs were created under President Trump. Wages for blue-collar workers were growing faster than those of white-collar workers.

In contrast, under President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, our country had one of the weakest economic recoveries since the Great Depression. Nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during their eight years in office. And an analysis published by the Hoover Institution at Stanford University finds that there will be 4.9 million fewer jobs under Joe Biden’s plan than under Donald Trump’s plan.

Donald Trump signed one of the largest tax cuts in American history. The vast majority of hard-working people in our country benefited from the Trump tax cuts. Lowering the marginal tax rates, doubling the standard deduction, and doubling the size of the child tax credit helps everyday citizens.

Donald Trump may not always talk and tweet the way we do in America’s Heartland, but he gets the job done.

Since the passage of the Trump tax cuts, millions of workers have received pay raises, bonuses or increased retirement contributions. Plus, the tax reform created Opportunity Zones to help low-income and distressed areas.

In contrast, Joe Biden wants to repeal the Trump tax cuts. He said so over and over this year. You cannot repeal the tax cuts and then only tax people making more than $400,000. Repealing the tax cuts means most workers in America are going to see a tax increase under Biden’s plan. Raising taxes is not the answer as we move forward with the recovery.

Joe Biden is proposing to raise taxes by nearly $4 trillion. That would be the largest in U.S. history and four times as large as the increase proposed in 2016 by candidate Hillary Clinton. His higher taxes on employers would make it difficult for American businesses to compete with foreign companies. That would likely increase the move to send American jobs to other countries.

Donald Trump got rid of the individual mandate that was a significant problem under ObamaCare. He wants to repeal the rest of the failing program and replace it with a system that leads to lower health care costs and better treatment.

In contrast, Joe Biden wants to expand ObamaCare to include a public option. This would open the door to our health care system being run by the federal government. Remember when they could not figure out the rollout of the ObamaCare website? Do you really want these people to make our health care decisions?

Government-run health care will fail in America. It will end our private health plans and end up moving us and our families into a government-run system likely filled with fewer choices, higher costs and long waits for care. That’s not the kind of America in which I want to live.

Washington is full of politicians who say all the right things but don’t get squat done for the hard-working taxpayers. Donald Trump may not always talk and tweet the way we do in America’s Heartland, but he gets the job done. If we have to pick between a talker and a doer, I will pick a doer every single time.

Donald Trump is a doer. He helped get Americans back to work before and he will again – if given the chance for four more years.

Peru's Machu Picchu reopens to tourists after 8-month coronavirus lockdown,"Machu Picchu, Peru’s top tourist destination, welcomed back visitors Sunday after being closed for nearly eight months during the coronavirus pandemic.

The ancient Incan city in the Andes mountains is only allowing access to 675 tourists per day, or only about 30% of the number of tourists before the pandemic hit, AFP News reported.

The Incan citadel, which dates back to the 15th century and sits atop a 7,970-foot mountain, reopened with a light show and Incan ritual.

""Today, Machu Picchu opens. It opens with (health and safety) protocols, it opens to say that we are reactivating ourselves but with responsibility and great prudence because we see everything happening in the world,"" Foreign Trade and Tourism Minister Rocio Barrios said in a speech.

While the global tourism industry as a whole has been rocked by the pandemic, thousands of workers had reportedly lost their income near the citadel alone. Pre-COVID-19, there were 80 hotels in Ollantaytambo, a town in the Cusco region, but now at least half of them have gone bankrupt, Joaquin Randall, head of the local hotel and restaurant association, told AFP.

The ancient city, meanwhile, had previously reopened last month for a single tourist, who was stranded in Peru for nearly seven months during the pandemic. The traveler, Japanese tourist Jesse Katayama, 26, was en route to visit the Inca citadel in March when lockdowns were announced.

"Hosting Thanksgiving? Amid coronavirus pandemic, you may need to rethink your dinner plans: expert","Thanksgiving is soon upon us, and after a year of ups and (mostly) downs, people are looking forward to the cheerful comfort of the holidays.

However, before you start counting out place settings — or Zoom invites — Dr. Erika Schwartz, an internist specializing in disease prevention, has some safety tips to keep you and your loved ones happy, and most importantly, healthy, this season.

Plan the guest list

As Dr. Anthony Fauci cautioned in recent interviews, positive cases are spiking across the nation. Some of these increases are even traced back to dinner parties and small gatherings, he said.

With that in mind, Schwartz also emphasized the importance of keeping gatherings small. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends citizens avoid traveling to friends' or relatives' homes and only hosting dinner guests who reside in a single household.

SUCCULENT CHRISTMAS 'TREES' ARE TRENDING THIS HOLIDAY SEASON

""Do not get on planes for dinner,"" she said, adding that any Thanksgiving celebration that involves lengthy travel should be skipped.

And when it comes to the already-slashed invite list, Schwartz says to keep the following in mind: What have these people been doing? Have they been quarantining? Do they work in, or are they coming from a place with a lot of positive cases? Who have they been with for the past two weeks? Will they practice social distancing or wear a mask when not?

Change the menu

“The good thing about Thanksgiving and holidays is the coronavirus is not spread through food,” said Schwartz. ""[But] don’t do food that is shared.”

Instead of family-style plating, with people passing platters around, keep the food in the kitchen – or some other separate space – and have people take turns going in, while socially distancing, and serving themselves using clean utensils, she advises.

And make sure no one is double-dipping — although, as Schwartz points out, it's wise to ""not double-dip,” pandemic or no pandemic.

Create a warm, and socially distanced environment

“Keep the windows open and use spaces and all areas of the house that you can,” Schwartz said, noting that guests should practice social distancing even while seated. “If you’re in a climate where you can eat outside, do that.”

“Social distance, and then after they leave, you clean and disinfect,” Schwartz continued. “If we respect each other and put the other one’s health and wellness ahead of ourselves, then we’ll behave better and the outcome will be better.

It should be noted, however, that the CDC considers small outdoor dinners — even with only friends and family from the same community in attendance — as a ""moderate risk activity.""

Be open and honest with your family and friends

“Learn how to communicate better with your family and explain your comfort level around people coming to your home,” Schwartz said, adding that hosts should be especially open when informing friends or family members that they may not be invited this year.

“If you’re not inviting someone, you should be able to explain why. And same if someone doesn’t want to come, you should give them the opportunity to tell you. Because you’re respecting them and they’re respecting themselves.”

“People have different comfort levels,” she added.

Go easy on the video calls

“The problem with Zoom is it’s not really intimate,” Schwartz said.

Instead of feeling disappointed by virtually connecting during dinner, Schwartz suggests protecting your mental health by sending a recorded video message wishing a happy Thanksgiving to family members you can’t be with, and focus on those you can be with.

Ever the dedicated civil servant, William carried out 14 official engagements while isolating.

Reportedly, William tested positive only days after his father, Prince Charles also tested positive for COVID-19 in late March.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson also contracted the virus around the same time. It is currently unclear if any other royals contracted the virus.

""There were important things going on and I didn’t want to worry anyone,"" William reportedly told an observer during an engagement.

The royal was treated by palace doctors and isolated in his Norfolk family home, Anmer Hall.

QUEEN ELIZABETH STEPS OUT WITH PRINCE WILLIAM FOR FIRST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SINCE MARCH

A source told the outlet that the Duke of Cambridge ""was hit pretty hard by the virus.""

""At one stage he was struggling to breathe, so obviously everyone around him was pretty panicked,"" they added. ""After seeing medics and testing positive -- which was obviously quite a shock given how fit and healthy he is -- William was determined it should be business as usual though.""

William's diagnosis was kept a secret as it came just after Johnson was hospitalized and Queen Elizabeth II had delivered her now-iconic address regarding the pandemic.

""He felt there were more important things going on in the country,"" said a source. ""But as a result of his own experiences, he realizes absolutely anyone can catch this awful disease -- and knows how imperative it is that we all take this second lockdown seriously.""

The UK recently announced a second strict lockdown in the wake of rising cases of coronavirus.

“First of all, he’s like a big giant. He came in like the Incredible Hulk,” she said. “We needed somebody to come on the scene, we were so dehydrated for real leadership that when he came on the scene looking like this big Italian hunk, he was like ‘wear a mask.’ I was like ‘I’ll wear a mask, I’ll put a mask on every part of my body.

This time, a photo of a man who appears to be the CNN anchor getting a haircut without a mask circulated on Twitter on Sunday. It’s unknown when the photo was taken, but it’s presumably from the coronavirus-era as the person cutting hair is donning a mask.

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last week, Cuomo was caught gallivanting around New York without a protective mask, according to the New York Post.

“Spies spotted the CNN anchor hanging at a downtown private members club, hobnobbing without a mask and acting like he was the mayor of the joint,” Post reporter Carlos Greer wrote.

FLASHBACK: CHRIS CUOMO SLAMS PENCE FOR NOT WEARING MASK AT CLINIC

Cuomo, the younger brother of Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, regularly condemns President Trump and members of his administration for their handling of the ongoing pandemic and not wearing masks.

However, Cuomo doesn’t appear to always practice what he preaches, as ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" recently reported that he was scolded by his apartment building’s management for not wearing a mask. According to the Post, the CNN host still hasn’t gotten the message.

“He was not social distancing and was walking around indoors, shaking hands and greeting people without a mask. He was just hanging with Brooke Shields’ husband. It’s a double standard when his brother is attacking the restaurant industry and implementing all these senseless rules,” a source told the Post.

But the CNN host has landed in hot water because of his coronavirus-era behavior multiple times since the pandemic broke out earlier this year.

The CNN anchor’s own coronavirus timeline was scrutinized when he famously videotaped his “official reentry” into normal society after recovering from coronavirus back in April, claiming he had been stuck in his basement for weeks. But Cuomo had previously admitted he was involved in a heated altercation that took place outside his second property, not the home where he was allegedly confined to the basement.

Cuomo was also highly criticized earlier this year for refusing to ask his brother tough questions during a series of interviews as the pandemic raged in the Empire State.

Also, Dr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, has said: “In fact where we see the spread of COVID-19 is where we let down our guard, where we literally let down our mask because we feel comfortable with those we love, but the virus is just looking for opportunities to spread.""

In its latest report, the CDC assessed 101 households in Nashville, Tenn., and Marshfield, Wis., from April to September. The households included 101 index patients (or the believed source of infection) and 191 household contacts. These people took self-samples for the virus everyday for two weeks.

Over half (53%) of all household contacts were infected and “secondary infections occurred rapidly, with approximately 75% of infections identified within 5 days of the index patient’s illness onset,” the health agency wrote.

Younger index patients aged 12 to 17 years infected about 38% of household contacts, according to the data.

CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN

To lower the risk of virus spread at home, the CDC recommends isolating immediately upon coronavirus-like symptoms, testing positive, or testing due to high-risk exposure, whichever happens first. Also, everyone should wear masks in shared spaces at home.

Members of the same household should use separate bedrooms and bathrooms if possible, the CDC wrote. Finally, a significant number of infected people in the study were asymptomatic, which further emphasizes the importance of isolation, the agency wrote.

Snowden and his wife seek to be Russian-US dual nationals,"Former U.S. security contractor Edward Snowden said Monday that he and his wife intend to apply for Russian citizenship without renouncing their U.S. citizenship.

Snowden, a former contractor with the U.S. National Security Agency, has been living in Russia since 2013 to escape prosecution in the U.S. after leaking classified documents detailing government surveillance programs. He was granted permanent residency last month, his Russian lawyer said.

Snowden’s wife Lindsay Mills, an American who has been living with him in Russia, announced last week that the couple are expecting a child. According to Snowden’s lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, the child, a boy, will be born in December and will have Russian citizenship.

“After years of separation from our parents, my wife and I have no desire to be separated from our son. That’s why, in this era of pandemics and closed borders, we’re applying for dual U.S.-Russian citizenship,” Snowden said in a tweet Monday.

Kucherena told the Interfax news agency that the process of preparing the necessary paperwork for getting Snowden a Russian passport will start soon.

He will be able to get a Russian passport without renouncing his U.S. nationality after Russia earlier this year relaxed its strict citizenship laws. Previously the law required foreigners to renounce other nationalities in order to get Russian citizenship.

Snowden added in another tweet that the couple plans to be “raising our son with all the values of the America we love — including the freedom to speak his mind” and that he looked forward to the day he can return to the U.S., “so the whole family can be reunited.”

"Turkey earthquake death toll tops 57, 70-year-old pulled out alive from rubble","Rescue workers extricated a 70-year-old man from a collapsed building in western Turkey on Sunday, some 34 hours after a strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea struck Turkey and Greece, killing at least 57 people and injuring more than 900.

It was the latest series of remarkable rescues after the Friday afternoon earthquake, which was centered in the Aegean northeast of the Greek island of Samos.

Search-and-rescue teams were working in nine toppled or damaged buildings in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, but appeared to be finding more bodies Sunday than survivors.

STRONG AEGEAN SEA EARTHQUAKE TOPPLES BUILDINGS IN TURKEY

Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca raised the death toll Sunday in Izmir to 55. Two teenagers were killed Friday on Samos and at least 19 others were injured.

There was some debate over the magnitude of the earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey rated it 7.0, while Istanbul's Kandilli Institute put it at 6.9 and Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said it measured 6.6.

Ahmet Citim, 70, was pulled out of the rubble in the middle of the night and was hospitalized. Koca tweeted that Citim said: “I never lost hope.” The minister visited the survivor and said he was doing well.

The quake triggered a small tsunami that hit Samos and the Seferihisar district of Izmir, drowning one elderly woman. The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul, as well as in the Greek capital of Athens.

Hundreds of aftershocks followed. Turkey’s disaster agency said nearly 900 people were injured in Turkey alone.

THE RING OF FIRE EXPLAINED

Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said 26 badly damaged buildings would be demolished.

“It’s not the earthquake that kills but buildings,” he added, repeating a common slogan.

Turkey has a mix of older buildings and cheap or illegal construction, which can lead to serious damage and deaths when earthquakes hit. Regulations have been tightened in light of earthquakes to strengthen or demolish buildings and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities but it is not happening fast enough.

Two destroyed apartment buildings where much of the rescues are taking place had received reports of “decay” in 2012 and 2018, according to the municipal agency in charge of such certificates. A report on Turkish media including the Hurriyet newspaper said one of the buildings built in 1993 was at risk of earthquake damage because of low quality concrete and the lack of reinforcements. However, the building continued to be occupied.

AFAD said more than 5,700 personnel had been activated for rescue work and hundreds of others for food distribution, emergency help and building damage control.

Turkey is criss-crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well.

In a rare show of unity amid months of tense relations over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity over the quake toll.

The quake occurred as Turkey was already struggling with an economic downturn and the coronavirus pandemic. So far, more than 10,000 people with the virus have died in Turkey, and some experts have accused the government of concealing the true impact of the virus with the way it counts cases.

"NASCAR's Bristol playoff race is sold out, may have largest US sports crowd since pandemic began","NASCAR’s upcoming playoff race at Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee is sold out and could become the highest-attended sporting event in the U.S. since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.

Speedway officials announced Wednesday that the socially-distanced allotment of seats for the Sept. 19 event has been spoken for. It didn’t say exactly how many were made available, but the 162,000-seat track has been approved by the state to have roughly 30,000 fans in attendance.

That was also the case for the NASCAR All-Star race in July, where 22,000 fans showed up, according to the Associated Press. NASCAR and its host tracks do not typically release official attendance numbers.

The July race took place two days after Tennessee reported its peak daily number of COVID-19 cases at 3,314, which has since declined by 75%.

The All-Star Race crowd is still the biggest at any sporting event since coronavirus restrictions began being eased this summer. The University of Tennessee is currently planning to offer approximately 25,000 seats for its football home opener against Missouri at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville on Oct. 3.

"Chiefs having limited fans at Arrowhead Stadium may be safer than watching game at bar, crowded home, health official says","The Kansas City Chiefs are just one of a handful of teams that are going to allow a limited number of fans to come through the gates at their stadium starting in Week 1 against the Houston Texans.

Arrowhead Stadium will be filled at 22% capacity with 16,000 fans at the maximum being allowed into the building.

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS HIGHLIGHT GAMEDAY EXPERIENCE WHEN ATTENDING HOME GAMES AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

One school district in Missouri took issue with the Chiefs being allowed to have 16,000 fans in the stands while high schools are only allowed to have 100. The Blue Springs High School was issued a warning on breaking capacity limits for a sporting event at the end of August and could face a ban if the limit is broken again, according to FOX 4 KC.

Dr. Rex Archer, the Kansas City health director, told the station that the difference between a professional NFL game having thousands of fans during a pandemic versus a high school event comes down to hours and hours of extensive planning and manpower.

“Just because the Chiefs have the resources to do this in a relatively safe matter doesn’t mean that a high school stadium does,” Archer told FOX 4 KC.

Archer said he supported the limit on the number of fans at schools and contended that having fans at a larger event space like Arrowhead Stadium could be safer than having fans in a bar or crowded living room.

“We want to give it a try. There’s no guarantee we will even have the second game if this doesn’t work, but we thought it was worth trying,” he said.

The Chiefs laid out specific planning on their website for fans.

Seating and high-traffic areas of the stadium have been modified to support social distancing standards, and all concessions, retail points of sale and parking tollbooths will be cashless. All bags will be prohibited inside the stadium, and everyone must wear a mask at all times except when eating or drinking.

2020 NFL season: Everything you need to know ahead of kickoff,"The 2020 NFL season might be the most anticipated in recent memory.

The Kansas City Chiefs are coming off a magical season in which Patrick Mahomes led the team to its second Super Bowl championship in dramatic fashion over the San Francisco 49ers.

Both teams got back to work after the clock hit triple zeroes in Miami. But along with the other 30 teams in the league, had to face the uncertainty regarding the coronavirus pandemic which has claimed the lives of thousands and even affected some NFL players directly.

The pandemic forced the NFL to hold a virtual draft for the first time in history. Most of the seven rounds took place from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s basement. Fans got to peer into rookies’ homes to see how they were celebrating and even got to witness a few general managers at work.

After the draft was over, the NFL held virtual minicamps and eventually canceled the preseason in hopes of being more prepared to deal with the unknown come September when the Chiefs and the Houston Texans kick-off.

In the midst of the pandemic, there were also some offseason shakeups.

Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Cam Newton joined the New England Patriots. Mahomes, Chris Jones, and Travis Kelce received lucrative contract extensions. Several coaches were fired and hired.

All roads have led to Sept. 10 – the first game of the 2020 season and the start of the journey to Tampa, Fla., where Super Bowl LV will take place.

Disneyland Paris closes again as France enters second coronavirus lockdown,"Oh non.

Disneyland Paris has shut down for the second time this year as France enters its second national lockdown to fight a new wave of coronavirus infections.

The French theme park closed on Thursday night, citing the latest government guidance.

Disneyland Paris still plans to take reservations for the Christmas season from Dec. 19 through Jan. 3, with hopes of reopening then, according to a notice. The theme park will also be closed from Jan. 4 to Feb. 12.

DISNEY EMPLOYEE STARTS FOOD PANTRY FOR THOUSANDS OF COWORKERS LAID OFF, FURLOUGHED AMID CORONAVIRUS

“We thank you for your continued loyalty and understanding during this difficult period,” officials said in a statement.

Earlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a month-long lockdown from midnight Thursday until Dec. 1. Under the restrictions, effective Friday, people must stay home beyond shopping for essential products, seeking medical care or exercising for up to one hour a day, Reuters reports. Schools will stay open, and employees are allowed to go to work if it’s impossible to do the job from home.

Restaurants and other non-essential businesses have also been ordered to close their doors, the Associated Press reports.

According to the outlet, France saw 523 virus-related deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, the highest daily count since April. COVID patients are now said to fill 60% of intensive care units in France, where the viral disease has claimed the lives of 36,058 since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Macron said the nation has been “overpowered by a second wave” in a televised national address on Wednesday, stressing that “nothing is more important than human life.”

Disneyland Paris reopened to the public in July following a four-month closure after shutting down in March.

As for Mickey Mouse’s other branded parks, Hong Kong Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland, Tokyo Disney Resort and Disney World in Florida remain open with limited attendance and amplified safety protocol amid the coronavirus health crisis.

Stateside, Disneyland in California has been shut down since March. The entertainment giant made headlines in September when it announced that its 28,000 employees would be laid off as the pandemic continues.

"Veterans, Gold Star families and fifth graders will get free access to national parks","Veterans, Gold Star families and fifth graders will get free access to national parks starting next month.

The Department of Interior on Wednesday said the federal government is waiving fees on national parks, wildlife refuges and other federal lands for anyone who has worked in the United States Armed Forces, including the National Guard and Reserves, as well as immediate family members of fallen service members, beginning on Veterans Day, Nov. 11.

“With the utmost respect and gratitude, we are granting veterans and Gold Star Families free access to the iconic and treasured lands they fought to protect starting this Veteran’s Day and every single day thereafter,” U.S. Secretary of the Interior David L. Bernhardt said in a statement Wednesday.

Vets and their families will have free access to 2,000 public parks and locations across 400 million acres to hike, fish, bike, hunt and embark on more outdoor activities.

More Americans have rediscovered the great outdoors as a result of nationwide shutdowns. Indeed, a study from last month found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans reported a new appreciation for nature during the quarantine.

And getting fresh air is known to boost moods and mental health. Getting outside and being exposed to the elements has a myriad of benefits on mental health and wellness, a number of studies have shown. Researchers in a 2015 study compared brain activity of people in good health after taking a 90-minute walk in nature, or in an urban setting, and found that those who did a nature walk had lower activity in the region of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, where negative thoughts and emotions are processed.

"Biden says Catholic faith guides policies but gets hit on abortion, religious freedom","Joe Biden is touting his Catholic faith as groups are hitting him on issues held near and dear to the faithful and opposed by the church, including religious freedom for nuns and abortion.

In an op-ed for the Christian Post, Biden wrote that his Catholic faith guides his policies, including wearing masks to defeat the coronavirus pandemic, rooting out systemic racism, ending the ""evil of poverty,"" welcoming immigrants, and doing ""everything in our power to ensure that all God’s children have the hope and future they so rightfully deserve.""

In the vice-presidential debate, Kamala Harris said Biden would be the second practicing Roman Catholic president since JFK, as both campaigns seek to reach the key voting bloc in swing states.

BIDEN LAUNCHES ADS TOUTING HIS FAITH AFTER CARDINAL SAYS HE'S 'NOT A CATHOLIC IN GOOD STANDING'

Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, told Fox News Biden's candidacy has been confusing to Catholic voters ""who believe that being Catholic is more than just another label.""

“Joe Biden has campaigned on his Catholic faith while promising policies that contradict Catholic teaching and even threatening the Little Sisters of the Poor,"" McGuire said. ""The Bishops Conference has warned of the devastating consequences of the Equality Act for religious liberty and for girls and women but Joe Biden supports it.""

PROMINENT PASTOR GETS BACKLASH FOR EXPLAINING WHY HE ISN'T VOTING FOR TRUMP OR BIDEN

On the issue of abortion, which Biden didn't mention Thursday discussing his devout faith, Lila Rose, founder and president of Live Action, an anti-abortion organization, tweeted a clear-cut message to the Democratic nominee.

""You cannot claim to be a practicing Catholic and support the slaughter of children in the womb. To do so is heinous and despicable. And you cannot claim you 'didn’t know' when your faith, and basic moral law, is telling you loud and clear: You shall not kill,"" Rose wrote.

NUNS WEARING MAGA MASKS SPOTTED BEHIND TRUMP AT RALLY

Brian Burch, president of CatholicVote, a conservative political advocacy group, said Biden ""has put himself on a collision course with the Catholic Church by promising to pass the Equality Act in the first 100 days of his presidency.""

""Biden's aggressive support of the Act, together with his extreme abortion position, opposition to school choice, and pledge to restart the war on the Little Sisters makes clear his Catholic faith will be readily sacrificed at the altar of political expediency,"" Burch added. ""Come Tuesday, Catholics must understand the existential threat posed by a Biden-Harris ticket. Donald Trump remains the best – and only – choice for Catholic voters this election.”

""Joe Biden, sleepy Joe, spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. Michigan lost half of its auto jobs thanks to Biden's NAFTA and China disasters,"" Trump said on Sunday. ""Biden embraced the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for your auto industry and your state. If it was OK with you, I canceled it. ...

Trump won Michigan by less than half a percent in 2016. His team is hoping that even if he doesn't sweep the Midwest or Rust Belt, Trump can hold onto Michigan and earn 270 or more electoral votes.

Trump touted the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, designed to bring auto manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., which he signed in early 2020 before the coronavirus pandemic hit.

""Now we have the USMCA, which is great for you, and your companies won't believe it. Just kicked in,"" Trump said. ""A vote for Biden is a vote to completely eradicate, I mean you will eviscerate your auto industry. It will be terrible. We worked very hard to bring it back.""

Vegan butcher opens slicing fake meat in London,"This butchery has everything but meat.

The first vegan butcher in the U.K. has landed in North London selling meatless iterations of bacon, sausage and turkey with plant-based alternatives, Reuters reported.

Rudy’s Vegan Butcher is now slinging sliced “mock meats,” the plant-based deli describes on its website. The menu features “baycon,” made from the wheat protein seitan said to have a smoky flavor best paired with vegan eggs or over a veggie burger or in a faux BLT.

Then there’s meatless pastrami made with mustard and celery and “soysage” patties, a riff on pork made with soy protein and herbs. The timely opening falls on World Vegan Day Sunday.

“It’s all designed to emulate meat. It tastes like meat, it’s got meat-like texture,” Rudy’s Vegan Butcher co-founder Matthew Foster told Reuters.

More meat-eaters have been going ham for plant-based products globally with some seeking alternative protein options. The ongoing trend has also been fueled by meat shortages at grocery stores during the coronavirus pandemic with meat plants temporarily closed earlier this year around the U.S. as a result of the virus.

Indeed, Impossible Foods, the maker of the meatless burger that looks, cooks and tastes like real beef, increased its retail footprint expanding from 150 in January to nearly 15,000 globally this month. The Silicon Valley-based company and its rival Beyond Meat have beefed up distribution in Mainland China which comprises 28% of the world's global meat consumption, double the amount of the U.S., Mother Jones reported.

Italian town auctions homes for $1 to bring in residents: Report,"There’s yet another Italian town selling homes for one Euro, or $1.18

Salemi, Italy, will be auctioning off a few dozen abandoned houses, starting at one Euro, according to DailyMail.com.

The town, in the Southwest part of Sicily, is the latest to join the growing trend started by other towns such as Sambuca and Mussomeli.

Though Salemi is the most recent town to participate in the trend, DailyMail.com reported that it was one of the first places to recommend the strategy as a way to draw residents -- and have some of its old homes renovated.

However, the project took a while to get started because the town had to update some of its infrastructure.

Although the houses in Salemi are at a starting price of one Euro, they will be sold to the highest bidder.

New York home's giant Halloween spider décor goes viral: 'That’s how you keep kids away',"Although 2020 may have been a letdown, Halloween doesn’t have to be, as “giant” is apparently the name of the game when it comes to dramatic décor this year.

A home in western New York has gone viral for an outrageously oversized display, featuring an inflatable spider creeping down a cobweb as high as the house itself.

The village of East Aurora is home to the headquarters of Fisher-Price, where David Moomaw used to work as a toy engineer, WKBW reports.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues, the homeowner was inspired to go all-out to lift spirits this spooky season.

REAL ESTATE AGENT DECORATES HOMES WITH GIANT SKELETONS

""With so much going on this year I thought Halloween wasn't going to be the same and I felt if there was ever a time that we needed something other to look at it was now,"" Moomow, who is now retired, explained.

In May, he started building the animatronic arachnid that now floats down a cobweb from the roof to the ground of his home, in a stunt that’s shot to social media stardom. Footage of the shuffling spider has been viewed 8 million times since hitting TikTok this week, spooking scaredy cats and amusing Halloween enthusiasts.

“Yeah y’all can keep the candy,” a skeptic said.

“That’s how you keep kids away,” another agreed.

“I need to live in this town,” one fan argued.

“Imagine being drunk and seeing that,” another imagined.

Other TikTokers fixated on how much the massive monster likely cost to construct, and keep running.

"Influencer overstays lease at Hamptons house, refuses to pay $14,000 rent: report","An Instagram influencer has been accused of refusing to pay rent on a house in the Hamptons -- even while she reportedly stayed at the house for several months after her short-term lease had ended.

Marisa Hochberg, 32, rented a house in Montauk, New York, from Cheryl Berman-Schechter and her husband Matthew Schechter, according to a report from The New York Times.

Hochberg signed a lease for June 1 to Aug. 8 and agreed to pay $31,750, The Times reported.

About two weeks into her stay, Hochberg reportedly messaged Berman-Schechter asking if she was “looking to sell” the house.

“I’ve fallen in love with it haha -- figured I’d ask!” she wrote.

Berman-Schechter told her that she was not selling the house.

Soon after that, Hochberg was supposed to make her second rent payment of $14,450. The payment was due on June 15, but Berman-Schechter never got it.

Hochberg did not immediately respond to Fox News’s request for comment.

According to The Times, Hochberg’s father called Berman-Schechter to ask if his daughter could stay past her Aug. 8 move-out date, just days before the lease was set to end.

Berman-Schechter said no -- because new tenants were coming to stay -- but she reportedly offered to help Hochberg find a new place to live.

In response, Hochberg told her landlord that she couldn’t be forced to move out because of the tenant protection laws in New York, which made it harder for landlords to evict tenants.

Those laws were intended to protect vulnerable people from being evicted during the coronavirus pandemic, but according to a May report from the New York Post, the law has been used by wealthier people who squatted in nice homes in the Hamptons.

According to The Times, Hochberg stayed at the house until Oct. 12. Even in the days leading up to her move out, Hochberg reportedly posted pictures on Instagram of herself in the house.

London Marathon medalist Sara Hall says positivity and faith helped her across the finish line,"Catch her if you can.

Elite runner Sara Hall won second place in the women’s division of the virtual London Marathon this year, crossing the finish line at 2:22:01. The 37-year-old said faith, not fear, fueled her fire while training amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has upended the traditional racing circuit.

The marathon itself was originally scheduled to take place on April 26, but officials were forced to postpone the event until Oct. 4. Further changes included the exclusion of anyone not deemed an elite runner, and the use of a smaller track with multiple laps, rather than the traditional citywide route.

Hall admits the changes were a bit daunting — as was the future of her sport — but stayed positive, and in top physical form, with her eyes on the prize.

The professional athlete recently spoke with Fox News about how previous challenges pushed her to the podium, as well as her thoughts on how the ongoing outbreak has changed everything — plus what keeps her motivated today.

PRINCE HARRY SURPRISES LONDON MARATHON RUNNERS IN LOS ANGELES BEFORE THE VIRTUAL EVENT

FOX NEWS: How has COVID-19 changed racing and training?

Sara Hall: This was a year unlike any other as an athlete. It was challenging to not have any races for such a long stretch of time. My last race was the end of February at the U.S. Olympic trials, and that was actually the biggest disappointment of my career, not making that team. I was hoping to just refocus towards more races and use that fitness I’d built towards future races, but then everything was just canceled, including the U.S. track trials in June, which would have been my other shot at making it to the Tokyo Olympics.

It was difficult to stay motivated at times and intrinsically motivate myself, because usually these races provide benchmark of where you’re at. I had no idea if I was going to be able to do any races in 2020, but fortunately, I was able to just keep grinding and keep the faith. I actually started training for a marathon before I even knew London was going to be putting on the race… just in faith that there would be an opportunity.

FOX: Do you think virtual racing will influence competitions of the future?

Hall: It’s hard to tell at this point. I hope we can get back to the mass-participation races, because that’s what makes a marathon so special. It’s just such a beautiful celebration of humanity, and I hope we can get back to that.

FOX: As a runner, how important is it to have competitions on the calendar?

Hall: It’s really important! That’s what gives your training purpose, and that’s the fun part of running — getting the chance to compete and test yourself against other people. It’s great to do virtual races in the meantime, but you’re never going to fully get the most out of yourself as when you’re being pushed by others. In the finish of London, I was sprinting down the world champion to give second place, and that just pulled up the best race I’ve ever done, having her to compete against.

""I just kept focusing on 'What can I do my best with, right now?' and that led to the biggest breakthrough of my career.""

CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN

FOX: What did you learn from the London Marathon?

Hall: This whole buildup has taught me to learn to thrive right where you’re at. It was challenging in so many ways – I have four kids, and they were doing school at home – but I just kept focusing on, “What can I do right now? What are the opportunities in front of me? What can I do my best with right now?” And that led to the biggest breakthrough of my career.

In the race itself, I was experiencing discouragement. I was in the worst position you could possibly be in the marathon, I ran almost every step of it alone, until the end, when I was catching people. There were times that I was fighting to stay positive, but I just kept telling myself, “I’m so thankful for this opportunity to race, at a time when there’s no races. I love racing.”

And that gratitude kept me moving forward, and kept me in the position where I could get onto the podium later in the race.

I think that’s just a great image for this year — gratitude. And focusing on doing the best with what you can do every day, to move forward through this time.

FOX: What kept you motivated while training during lockdown?

Hall: [A lot of it was] continuing to see my potential… I’m 37, so it’s kind of unusual to still be improving at this age, but I am absorbing training the best I ever have. I wanted to just keep putting in the work to reach new levels, and see how far I can take it.

It took a lot of faith that what I was seeing in training would eventually get manifested in a race.

FOX: Do you have any training tips for recreational runners preparing for virtual races? You set a personal record with a half marathon this summer at 1:08:18, which Runner’s World heralded as the “sixth-fastest” for an American of all time.

Hall: The half marathon in Eugene in August was kind of like a time trial by myself, with a couple other guys helping pace me.

As much as you can kind of create some atmosphere for yourself, whether it’s a good playlist or having someone bike in front of you and go the pace you want to go, or with a training partner, those kinds of things are key and helped me out there.

FOX: What goals are you focusing on next?

Hall: I’ll be participating in the ASICS World Ekiden [in November.] My very first professional race was an Ekiden, and I love the concept of that – the marathon distance broken up into the legs – and that will help keep me motivated during this time. I’m also hoping to run another race before the end of the year, so I’m seeing what opportunities are out there.",,

Israel begins human trials for coronavirus vaccine,"Israel began human trials for its own coronavirus vaccine as the Jewish state’s second lockdown comes to a gradual end.

Two volunteers in separate hospitals – one in Tel Aviv and another in Jerusalem – have started the trials. If the two, Segev Harel and Aner Ottolenghi, feel in good health in the next two days, another 80 people will join the first phase of the trial.

According to officials, each volunteer will get either a dose of the vaccine or a placebo and will be sent home, where they will be monitored for three weeks for any possible side effects or whether they develop antibodies.

Harel said he is very proud to be part of such an important national mission and said he is not nervous.

MODERNA WILL HAVE 20M CORONAVIRUS VACCINES READY BY YEAR'S END

If the first phase is successful, the second phase is scheduled for December and will include nearly 1,000 volunteers. A final phase will be open to 30,000 volunteers and will begin in April 2021.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz visited the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv, where the first vaccine was administered.

“There is a cause for a measure of cautious optimism today,” Gantz said. “Optimism, because I think excellent work is being done by our top scientists across the board, all of whom are giving their very best, and this is cause for optimism.”

He said it will take time to track and process the data and draw conclusions. He asked for patience.

“I see the light at the end of the tunnel,” Netanyahu said. “I see the vaccines in the state of Israel. In this means or another, a vaccine developed here or abroad we will bring enough vaccines to the Israeli citizens, and we will break free from this pandemic.”

The commercial name of the vaccine is ""BriLife."" The first part of the name, ""Bri"", refers to the Hebrew word for health, ""briut,"" the second part, ""il"" alludes to Israel, and ""life"" speaks to the importance of the vaccine.

When her human pen pals stopped writing, she turned to the fairies who had taken up residence at a tree in her Virginia neighborhood. And the fairies wrote back.

“They care about you,” she said. ""And they want to write to you.”

Beneath a crape myrtle at the edge of a lawn in Norfolk lies a fairy village. A sign on a small wooden door shaped like a slice of bread lets visitors know fairies are sleeping behind the smooth bark. Tiny buildings with mushroom spires and flowers line the sidewalk below.

Perhaps just as important are the cedar tables and chairs, the paper and the pens. One mailbox, often brimming with envelopes, welcomes correspondence. Another offers responses from the likes of the Fairy Godmother, Fairy Queen Lysandra, and Tinker Bell.

The fairy tree village appeared in July outside the home of journalist and children’s book author Lisa Suhay, 55, a mother of five. Word spread online and now youngsters arrive wearing pixie wings or princess gowns and a website connects children who live farther away.

In the past few months, more than 700 letters have arrived — from neighborhood children but also from nearby cities such as Virginia Beach. Not a small number appear to be from students at Old Dominion University, a state school down the street.

For some, the letters offer a reprieve from days stuck at home and in virtual school. They also provide something much deeper — a therapeutic opportunity for wishing, confessing, and venting.

One child writes: “Can U please make the corona disappear very soon?”

Another says, “We are moving to Guam but will you still be my friend?”

And yet another tells of a mother, a teacher, who was crying and asks, “Can you help her?”

Some are drawings of Tinker Bell. Others come with gifts, such as a cicada shell.

There are complaints about school. And demands to know if fairies are real.

“Dearest Queen Lysandra, I’m sorry I ever doubted you,” began one letter, clearly not the first from its author.

Older letter writers share anxieties and insecurities. One thanked the fairies for advice to break up with her “toxic” boyfriend. “I’ve never felt so free!” she wrote.

Some express gratitude. Many wish for peace.

And then there are those like Maya and her two friends, sisters Sophie and Cate Carroll. They’ve become deeply engaged in this fairy world, which includes pixies, elves, gremlins, hobgoblins, and trolls.

The fairies reached out to a local cable provider when Sophie and Cate’s Wi-Fi went down as school was starting and the company made their network “gremlin free.”

Maya wrote about her 5-year-old brother Aiden, whose hearing disability made communicating through masks difficult. The Fairy Godmother sent along masks with clear plastic windows around the mouth.

“It’s given her an outlet to vent some of her concerns and fears and feel a little more secure,” said Maya’s mother, Jennifer Gebler. “She can have a sanctuary that’s removed from all the craziness that we’re seeing this year.”

President Trump's reelection campaign reportedly said it would send more than a billion texts, while progressive organization MoveOn told ABC News on Sunday that it had already sent out 350 million messages.

Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaign and other groups have sent out hundreds of millions of texts. According to MIT Technology Review, it's estimated that voters will have received almost 3 billion messages.

The effort is orchestrated largely with political texting apps that utilize public voter registration records to load telephone phone numbers automatically. Most states require voters to give their phone number and address as part of the registration process.

While robocalls and texts are widely illegal without the approval of those at the other end of the line, the Federal Communications Commission says that outreach from political volunteers is not.

Nevertheless, wireless carriers have worried about customer sentiment -- taking a more active role in monitoring the texts, according to The Wall Street Journal.

In 2019, carriers agreed to new standards that require senders to get consent before hitting ""send.""

In September, AT&T reportedly sent a memo that executives had seen a notable increase in customer complaints about unwanted texts.

While the onslaught is expected to end following the election, campaigns have other worries. Chief among them is the spread of misinformation -- particularly since text messages aren't archived and have been misused before.

This close to Election Day, the brunt of the concern relates to details about polling locations and voting hours.

Just two weeks ago, Oklahoma's State Election Board issued a warning about a fraudulent text message claiming there had been changes to polling places. The phone number linked to the messages was for a male escort service.",,
"Federal court to hear Republican bid to toss 127,000 ballots in Texas","A federal judge in Houston is holding an emergency hearing Monday morning over a Republican-led effort to toss out nearly 127,000 ballots in the largest Texas county.

U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, will hear arguments from four Texas Republicans seeking to invalidate all ballots cast at drive-thru polling stations in Harris County, a Democratic stronghold.

The Republican activists and candidates are arguing that the drive-thru program is an expansion of curbside voting, and therefore should only be available to voters with disabilities under state election law. They have also challenged the practice as a violation of the U.S. Constitution, which gives state legislatures the authority to decide how elections are run.

TEXAS GOV SUED OVER PLAN TO REDUCE BALLOT DROP BOX LOCATIONS

On top of throwing out ballots already cast via drive-thru voting, the Republicans are looking to ban the use of the practice on Tuesday during Election Day.

The Texas Supreme Court rejected a case from the same plaintiffs over the same issue on Sunday. The all-Republican court did not explain why it had thrown out the lawsuit.

State election law has long allowed Texans with medical conditions to vote curbside, in which a ballot is brought outside to them by a poll worker while the voter remains in their car. Harris County also opened 10 drive-thru locations in October for early voting, in which voters are handed a portable machine through their car window to vote, as a safety measure during the coronavirus pandemic.

Drive-thru voting allows for voters to safely cast their ballots while ""naturally socially distanced"" within their vehicles and is as secure as walk-in voting, according to the Harris County Clerk's Office website.

As of Friday, nearly 127,000 of Harris County's 2.4 million eligible voters had cast a ballot through drive-thru voting, representing about 9% of the total votes cast so far.

TEXAS COUNTY SUED OVER LACK OF POLLING SITES

In a brief filed late Sunday night, attorneys for Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins called on Hanen to reject the lawsuit.

""The Texas Supreme Court has twice declined to interfere,"" the brief says. ""The fact that the final arbiter of the Texas Election Code found no justification for interfering with drive-through polling places—based on the same legal arguments—in the middle of the election is an unmistakable indication that the public interest is best served by allowing the election to proceed without interference.""

Texas has some of the most stringent voting laws in the country and is one of a handful of states that did not relax criteria for requesting mail-in ballots during the virus-induced crisis. The state allows voters to cast an absentee ballot if they are over the age of 65, have an illness or disability, will be out of the country for early voting or Election Day, or are in jail but otherwise eligible to vote.

According to an aggregate of polls from RealClearPolitics, President Trump is leading Democratic rival Joe Biden by 4.4 percentage points in Texas.

Dems grasp at opportunities in red states as Election Day looms,"Hoping to make major political inroads this November, Democrats have set their sights on traditionally Republican-leaning states.

Both in the 2020 presidential contest and races for seats in the House and Senate, the liberal-leaning party sees opportunities as shifting demographics, new voters, and Republicans voting for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden strengthen its position.

ELECTION DAY 3 DAYS AWAY: TRUMP, BIDEN BARNSTORM SWING STATES

Arizona, a battleground state that has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1948, is purple this year, with the introduction of young voters and progressive-leaning Latino voters in its largest counties.

In a special election race, Democratic challenger Mark Kelly -- a former NASA astronaut -- has taken the lead against Republican incumbent Sen. Martha McSally. If elected, Kelly would serve alongside Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who beat McSally to win her seat in the 2018 midterm elections.

On Friday, The Associated Press reported that Democrats have a shot of taking control of one or both chambers of the state's predominantly Republican Legislature -- for the first time in nearly three decades.

While Democrats see states like Arizona as ""in play,"" they also see conservative counties like Pinal and Tucson as major opportunities to pass progressive measures.

While Gov. Doug Ducey is a Republican, a Democratic legislature could seriously hinder the GOP agenda. The party will need a net gain of three Senate seats and two House seats for a majority.

In neighboring Texas -- a Republican stronghold prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Democrats have also identified a path to victory.

The Real Clear Politics average has President Trump oscillating between a one- and three-percentage point lead over Biden. Quinnipiac University's latest poll shows the pair in a dead heat, tied at 47% to 47% among likely voters.

As The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, Trump underperformed Republican congressional candidates in Texas by five points four years ago. It's an understatement to say voters weren't showing up then like they are now.

In Texas, more than 9 million residents have voted, according to the U.S. Elections Project. In 2016, the total turnout for the nation's second-most populous state was 8,969,226.

With just three days until Election Day, Trump and Biden are walking a tightrope to the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win the office.

Trump is on the defensive as Biden and Democrats gain ground in states like Georgia -- another red state -- and nail-biting Florida.

Philly mayor warns it 'will easily take several days' to count ballots,"Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...

Philadelphia mayor warns residents mail-in ballot count may take days to complete

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat, warned residents in his city that counting the mail-in ballots “will easily take several days” after Election Day, which increases the possibility that it could be a while before the election is settled.

Pennsylvania has been seen as one of the most pivotal states in the election. President Trump hopes to attract a massive surge in voters from outside Philadelphia and its suburbs in order to offset the highly Democrat city. Kenney’s announcement could open the possibility that Trump opens up a massive lead going into Nov. 4, but could see that advantage evaporate as the vote from the city gets tallied.

Nate Silver, the pollster, told ABC’s “This Week” that he thinks the 2020 election will come down to Pennsylvania.



“Pennsylvania has not bumped up to a seven or eight-point Biden lead, like we see in Michigan and Wisconsin,” he said. Biden leads Trump by 4.9% in Pennsylvania, according to FiveThirtyEight’s updating average of 2020 presidential general election polls, compared to a more sizeable lead of 8.4% in Michigan and 8.6% in Wisconsin.

Bloomberg reported Philadelphia has already received 400,000 mail-in ballots and pointed out that three-quarters of the voters there are registered Democrats. They noted that the city could very well determine who wins the state. CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON OUR TOP STORY.

Talk of Biden blowout on Election Night has died down: 'The picture has changed': Bret Baier

Political insiders once believed Joe Biden was on course for a blowout victory over President Trump on Election Night, but ""the picture has changed"" in the waning days of the campaign, Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier said Sunday.

""For Trump supporters, they said they knew this all along, in fact, they say it will be a blowout the other way,"" Baier told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"". ""I don't see that picture either, [but] I do see a national race that may have some separation [between Biden and Trump states], if you look at the corners of the country.""

As candidates make their final pitch to the American people, the race in battleground states ""is narrowing, and narrowing fast,"" the ""Special Report"" host told Tucker Carlson.

""If you look at 2016 as a template, if you are within the margin of error, Donald Trump has outperformed that, at least in the past,"" Baier said, ""and there is some indication that it is not going to be different. They are already seeing some movement in Florida.""



If Trump carries Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona, the fate of his reelection bid will come down to Pennsylvania, the ""Special Report"" host explained.

As for the sudden movement in the polls, Baier said it could be attributed to Trump's recent ""barnstorming and whipping up the vote,"" coupled with a recognition among voters that this election represents ""a binary choice."" CLICK HERE FOR MORE.

Michigan Gov. Whitmer tightens coronavirus restrictions, follows Democratic lead on lockdowns

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently updated the state’s coronavirus policies, tightening the grip on her increasingly strict lockdown.

According to the Democratic governor's new requirements, all dine-in establishments must take down customers’ names and phone numbers for contact tracing beginning Monday, Nov. 3. This updated policy, as well as others, threaten a civil fine of $1,000 and interference of law enforcement upon disobedience.

The issuance of tightened restrictions comes from a recent spike in Michigan coronavirus cases. According to the state, there’s been a 3.5% increase in positive tests with about 3,000 cases being reported each day.



The updated order also suppresses capacity at indoor venues and recommends the public refrain from shouting or cheering at social events.

“The heart of our effort to beat COVID will be in the hearts and minds of individual Michiganders... choosing to protect human life and to act on the science,” Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services director Robert Gordon explained during a virtual news conference.

Biden says Trump's coronavirus response 'almost criminal' during rally in Philadelphia,"Former Vice President Joe Biden made a pitch to Black voters in Philadelphia on Sunday, arguing that they had been hit hard by the coronavirus and President Trump's purportedly divisive tone while in office.

""In two days, we can put an end to a presidency that fanned the flames of hate, poured gasoline on every opportunity he had all across this nation,"" Biden said at the ""souls to the polls"" event.

The former vice president described Trump's response to the virus, which has disproportionately impacted Black communities, as ""almost criminal.""

He added that his response to the pandemic would include a plan for ""full and fair distribution of therapeutics and vaccines"" as well as ""a plan to address the disproportionate way this virus has been hitting and devastating the Black community across America.""

JOE BIDEN BECOME 'AN UNDERDOG' IF HE DOESN'T WIN PA., SAYS NATE SILVER

Biden described the election as ""the most important election of our lifetimes. We're at an inflection point, so we have to vote like we never did before.""

Referring to the late Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, Biden described freedom as an act. ""As my late friend John Lewis reminded us, freedom is not a state, freedom is an act. We have to defend it. We have to vote,"" he said.

Sunday's rally was part of a broader final push by the Biden campaign to mobilize Black voters before Election Day.

With more than 91 million votes already cast, Trump and Biden are out of time to reshape the race. Instead, they’re focusing on their base and making sure that any potential supporters have either already voted or plan to do so in person on Tuesday.

For Biden, that means paying close attention to Black voters who are a critical part of the coalition he needs to build to win. His campaign’s final burst of travel was tailored to boost that support: After Philadelphia, he was to be in Cleveland and Pittsburgh on Monday. And after stops with Biden in Detroit and Flint, Mich., on Saturday, former President Barack Obama heads to Georgia on Monday to stump for his vice president's own White House bid.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett hearing first Supreme Court oral arguments Monday,"Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett on Monday is participating in her first-ever oral arguments on the high court after being confirmed and seated just under one week ago.

Court-watchers will not be able to see the justice in-person sitting on the Supreme Court bench because of the coronavirus pandemic. But anyone in the country can hear Barrett through the livestream of the Supreme Court's remote oral arguments in two separate cases Monday.

Before the court Monday are two cases set to be argued at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. First, the court will hear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club, Inc. -- a Freedom of Information Act case -- before hearing Salinas v. Railroad Retirement Board.

TRUMP ALREADY CHOSE BARRETT SUCCESSOR ON APPEALS COURT, CONFIRMATION POSSIBLE REGARDLESS OF ELECTION OUTCOME

Because the remote oral arguments are done via traditional phone line instead of video conference, the arguments are much more structured than the typical free-for-all format in which justices interrupt the lawyers arguing before them at will. The lawyers will open their arguments with brief comments before justices each get five minutes to quiz the lawyers on their own, by descending order of seniority.

This means it will likely be a half-hour or more after 10 a.m. before Barrett first speaks. She will follow Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is now the second-most junior justice.

There were not plans for Chief Justice John Roberts to give a formal statement on Barrett joining the court -- the court said last week there are plans for a formal ceremony during a special sitting in the Supreme Court's courtroom in the future. But Roberts did say Monday it is his ""great pleasure"" to welcome his new colleague to the famously collegial bench.

The Supreme Court will also hear two criminal cases on Tuesday before it gets into hot-button issues Wednesday and next week.

On Wednesday, the court will hear Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is a case about whether or not a city can prevent a religious group that does not place foster children with same-sex couples from participating in its foster program. On Nov. 9 the court will hear a case on immigration, and on Nov. 10 it will hear Texas v. California, the case about the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that loomed large over Barrett's confirmation process.

The Supreme Court on Monday also released an order list from its Friday conference, which was the first Barrett would have participated in as a justice. But the court in its order list said ""Justice Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision of the motions or petitions appearing on this Order List.""

This is consistent with a handful of decisions the Supreme Court made in emergency election-related cases last week in which Barrett did not participate because she had not been able to review all the briefs from the parties after only being seated Tuesday.

Conferences are where justices meet behind closed doors, primarily deciding which cases they will put on their docket. The court did not add any new cases to its docket Monday, but did issue a handful of ""per curium"" decisions.

"Fox News Poll: Majority trusts Biden on COVID, half say virus is out of control","Less than a week before Election Day, the electorate’s outlook is gloomy. More than 6-in-10 rate economic conditions negatively and only about 2-in-10 think coronavirus is under control in the U.S., according to the latest Fox News national survey of likely voters.

In fact, just over half, 51 percent, say it is “not at all” under control -- up from 40 percent in early September.

When asked what should be the federal government’s top priority, voters are 25 points more likely to rank limiting the spread of coronavirus over restarting the economy (61-36 percent).

Who do voters trust to handle these competing issues? President Trump is preferred on the economy by just 1 point, while more trust Democratic candidate Joe Biden on coronavirus by 16 points.

EARLY VOTERS CAST RECORD 92M BALLOTS AS ELECTION DAY NEARS

Biden’s current advantage on coronavirus is double the 8-point edge he held last month. At the same time, Trump’s edge on the economy declined by 4 points.

“The pandemic has complicated the president’s plan to run for re-election on the economy,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. “COVID-19 is the dominant issue for voters and they think Biden would do a better job.”

By a 6-point margin, more pick Biden over Trump on handling Supreme Court nominations. Biden’s advantage is unchanged since September, before Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the high court.

In the head-to-head matchup, Biden leads Trump by 52-44 percent among likely voters. That’s a bit tighter than the race was three weeks ago, when Biden led by 53-43 percent (October 3-6).

The survey, released Sunday, asked about several candidate traits and finds over half think Biden cares about people like them (56 percent) and is honest and trustworthy (52 percent). For Trump it’s the reverse, as majorities say he lacks empathy (56 percent) and honesty (60 percent).

Notably, the president’s honesty marks are identical to those he received just before he went on to win the 2016 election. At that time, 37 percent of likely voters said Trump was honest and trustworthy and 60 percent disagreed (November 3-6, 2016). Voters also said Hillary Clinton was dishonest (33 honest vs. 64 dishonest). This time, a 52-percent majority sees the Democratic candidate as honest and trustworthy (45 percent disagree).

Ratings of the two candidates more closely align on “standing up for what he believes.” Sixty-four percent think Biden does -- and even more, 68 percent, say the same about Trump.

When asked if the word “corrupt” describes the candidate, 56 percent say it applies to Trump compared to 40 percent for Biden.

Over half (53 percent) think Trump is “too close to extremist” groups, while 37 percent feel that way about Biden.

DEMS GRASP AT OPORTUNITIES IN RED STATES AS ELECTION DAY LOOMS

One Republican in five thinks Trump is corrupt (19 percent) and that he is too close to extremist groups (20 percent).

Among Democrats, about 1-in-10 thinks Biden is corrupt (12 percent) and feel he is too close to extremist groups (11 percent).

Pollpourri

While 41 percent of registered voters think the disruption that Trump has brought to Washington is a good thing, an even larger number, 51 percent, don’t like it. Among Trump supporters, 85 percent see his disruption as a positive thing. Ninety-one percent of Biden supporters call it a bad thing.

Nearly half of registered voters, 47 percent, think Trump will win re-election. That’s down from 51 percent in September -- and a high of 56 percent who believed he would win in February.

Almost as many, 46 percent, think he won’t be re-elected.

Conducted October 27-29, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,318 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.

Fox News Poll: Biden's lead over Trump narrows slightly to 8 points,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s lead over President Trump has narrowed a touch to 8 points from a 10-point advantage in early October, according to a Fox News national survey of likely voters.

Biden is ahead by a 52-44 percent margin. It was 53-43 percent three weeks ago. His lead is outside the poll’s margin of sampling error. Two percent back a third-party candidate and 2 percent are undecided.

CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS

Among likely voters, support for the former vice president has been between 51-53 percent since early September. That notably distinguishes this year’s race from 2016, when neither candidate exceeded 48 percent support in pre-election surveys -- or the final election results.

The number of registered voters backing Biden is nearly identical to his support going all the way back to a hypothetical matchup in 2015. At that time, he led Trump by 50-37 percent.

“Biden is holding a substantial lead nationally, many votes are already cast, and there are few undecideds,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the survey with Republican Daron Shaw. “It’s hard to see the national race shifting significantly in the closing days, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible for Trump to again thread the needle on an Electoral College victory.”

The survey shows Trump is preferred by White men (+17 points), rural voters (+18), and White evangelical Christians (+50). Those margins are lower than what he received in 2016. According to Pew Research Center validated voter data, he won White men by 30 points, rural voters by 25, and White evangelicals by 61.

Biden is the favorite among women (+17 points), suburban women (+29), Hispanics (+18), Blacks (+66), and voters under age 30 (+32). That is a mixed bag compared to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 support. She won women by 15, suburban women by 11, and voters under 30 by 30 -- but won Blacks by 85 points and Hispanics by 38.

Seniors backed Trump by a 9-point margin in 2016, yet favor Biden by 10 in the new survey.

Independents, a small subgroup, favor Biden by 54-32 percent -- a group Trump won by a single point last time.

“Biden has the advantage among key groups, especially seniors, suburbanites, and independents,” says Shaw. “Trump needs a few more points out of these groups to win re-election. But the main impediment is the stubborn stability of the race; it hasn’t changed much all year despite pandemics, economic collapses, and massive social unrest.”

Another big difference in this election is that voters find one of the candidates likeable. That stands in stark contrast to 2016 when voters viewed both Clinton and Trump negatively.

Biden has a net +11 personal rating: 55 percent view him favorably vs. 44 percent unfavorably.

For Trump, 44 percent view him positively and 55 percent negatively, putting him underwater by 11 points. Moreover, 48 percent have a “strongly” unfavorable opinion of him compared to 34 percent for Biden.

Biden has a 4-point strength-of-support edge, as slightly more of his backers (86 percent) say they are “extremely” committed to their candidate than Trump supporters (82 percent).

And a touch more of those favoring Biden (78 percent) feel “extremely” motivated about voting than those backing Trump (74 percent). In November 2016, more Trump voters (64 percent) than Clinton voters (54 percent) were “extremely” interested in the race.

That said, only about 6 in 10 of those backing Biden say their vote is mainly “for” him (57 percent), while 8 in 10 of those backing Trump say the same (80 percent).

TRUMP, BIDEN BLITZ BATTLEGROUND STATES IN FINAL CAMPAIGN SPRINT

Biden supporters (41 percent) are more than twice as likely as Trump supporters (18 percent) to describe their vote as being “against” the other candidate.

Most of those casting a ballot in person back Trump (53 percent), while a majority of those voting by mail go for Biden (65 percent).

More than one in three voters report having already cast their ballot, and among this group the former vice president is ahead by 29 points. Trump leads by 16 points among those planning to vote on Election Day.

Overall, 46 percent of likely voters approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while a majority of 54 percent disapproves (46 percent “strongly” disapprove). His best marks came in April of this year, when views on his performance split 49-49 percent (registered voters).

"Fox News Poll: Trump gains in Ohio, Biden ahead in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin","Donald Trump holds a narrow advantage in Ohio, while voters in the three battleground states that put him over the top in 2016 prefer Joe Biden, according to Fox News statewide surveys of likely voters.

Biden leads by 12 points in Michigan (52-40 percent), 5 points in Pennsylvania (50-45 percent), and 5 points in Wisconsin (49-44 percent). Biden’s advantage is outside the margin of error in Michigan, but not Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump carried each of these states by less than a percentage point in 2016.

Trump’s 2016 victory in Ohio was by a wider 8-point margin, which is higher than his current 3-point edge in the Buckeye State (45 percent Biden to 48 percent Trump). That’s a reversal since last month, when Biden was ahead by 5 points in Ohio (50-45 percent).

The number who favor Trump’s re-election lags his 2016 vote share in each state.

Biden’s leads are not insurmountable. Trump has improved his standing in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin since September.

However, few voters are up for grabs. In each of the four states, fewer than 10 percent are undecided or support a third-party candidate. Plus, roughly equal majorities of Biden and Trump supporters, about 8 in 10, are extremely committed to their candidate.

It’s tough to overstate how important women voters are to Biden. They prefer him by 19 points in Michigan, 6 in Ohio, 12 in Pennsylvania, and 17 in Wisconsin. And he trounces Trump among suburban women: Michigan +35 points, Ohio +18, Pennsylvania +29, and Wisconsin +21.

Trump is the choice among rural voters in each state -- by wide margins in Ohio (+27 points) and Pennsylvania (+21), and smaller spreads in Michigan (+11) and Wisconsin (+6). In 2016, he won rural voters nationally by 25 points, according to Pew Research Center validated voter data.

White men without a college degree were an important constituency for Trump four years ago, and they are still big supporters. He leads by double-digit margins among this group in all four states (by 15 points in Michigan, 35 in Ohio, 19 in Pennsylvania, and 18 in Wisconsin). The president’s lead is nearly as large among white men overall. He’s up by 12 points in Michigan, 24 in Ohio, 13 in Pennsylvania, and 19 in Wisconsin.

“Trump is polling behind his 2016 support, but remains competitive across these crucial rust-belt states,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News survey with Republican Daron Shaw. “Lower than expected turnout among young people combined with robust rural turnout could easily put Ohio in Trump’s column again, and possibly Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, too.”

Seniors in Ohio (+6 points) and Pennsylvania (+1) favor Trump, while they pick Biden in Michigan (+13 points) and Wisconsin (+14).

Voters under age 35 back the Democrat: Michigan (by 34 points), Ohio (+17), Pennsylvania (+33), and Wisconsin (+25).

Party loyalty is also a factor. In Michigan, by 8 points, more Democrats support Biden (94 percent) than Republicans back Trump (86 percent). The loyalty gap is 9 points in Wisconsin, with 96 percent of Democrats for Biden compared to 87 percent of Republicans for Trump.

On the economy, more trust Trump to do a better job than Biden in Ohio (by 11 points), Pennsylvania (+5), and Wisconsin (+7), while the two tie in Michigan.

By larger spreads, voters prefer Biden to handle coronavirus in all four states: Michigan (by 17 points), Ohio (+6), Pennsylvania (+11), and Wisconsin (+13).

“The economy is still the key to success for Trump,” says Shaw. “Voters don’t rate him very favorably on handling the pandemic and that’s a big drag on his re-election chances right now.”

Meanwhile, Biden is more popular than Trump. The former vice president gets net positive favorable ratings in Michigan (+8 points), Ohio (+2), Pennsylvania (+9), and Wisconsin (+3). Trump’s ratings are net negative by 13 points, 3 points, 8 points, and 9 points respectively.

Across these rust-belt states, most voters casting their ballot by mail support Biden (between 61-73 percent), while over half of those voting in person go for Trump (between 55-59 percent).

Conducted October 17-20, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), these Fox News surveys include interviews with likely voters in Michigan (1,032), Ohio (1,018), Pennsylvania (1,045), and Wisconsin (1,037) randomly selected from statewide voter files, who spoke with live interviewers on landlines and cellphones. In each state, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the total sample of likely voters.

Fox News Poll: Biden gains ground over Trump,"Democratic candidate Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump by a 53-43 percent margin, in a Fox News national survey of likely voters conducted after a combative debate and the president testing positive for coronavirus. Biden’s 10-point advantage is up from a 5-point lead last month.

The incumbent faces a challenging landscape:

-- Voters think the stakes are high. A 70 percent majority believes our democracy is “in danger” in this election, including about 8 in 10 Biden supporters and 6 in 10 Trump supporters.

-- On coronavirus, most, 72 percent, favor requiring masks when people are outside their home, while the number who think the virus is under control is small (24 percent mostly/completely) -- and down from a month ago (30 percent). Almost twice as many voters prioritize limiting the spread of coronavirus over restarting the economy.

-- Most rate economic conditions negatively (65 percent only fair/poor).

Coronavirus and the economy are the two issues that matter most to voters in deciding their choice for president. The same number, 44 percent, say the pandemic will be the single most important factor as say the economy will be the top factor. That’s more than say the same about health care (34 percent), racism (26 percent), the Supreme Court and violent crime (25 percent each).

Biden leads Trump by 39 points among those saying coronavirus is the most important factor, while Trump is preferred among those saying the economy by 12.

Twice as many voters want to keep ObamaCare in place as want to repeal the health care law (64-32 percent), and voters who prioritize health care favor Biden by 32 points.

Those who say violent crime is the most important factor to their vote favor Trump by a single point, while voters who prioritize racism back Biden by 44.

A 58 percent majority thinks the way Trump talks about racial inequality is leading to an increase in violence, including 28 percent of those supporting him. For comparison, 38 percent believe Biden’s language incites violence, including 17 percent backing him.

On the Supreme Court, 54 percent don’t think a president should get to appoint someone to a lifetime position this close to the election, while 44 percent think it is the responsibility of current leaders to act to fill the vacancy created by Justice Ginsburg’s death. This is a reversal from 2016, in the wake of Justice Scalia’s death, when most felt it was the responsibility of current leaders to act by a 62-34 percent margin.

Views divide evenly over increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court, with about one in five unsure.

Biden leads Trump by 5 points among those saying the high court is the most important factor in their vote. At the same time, half would vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett. Nine in 10 Republicans favor her confirmation, while 8 in 10 Democrats oppose it. Support for Barrett’s confirmation is a touch better than the highest numbers Brett Kavanaugh received for his nomination and in line with the highest Neil Gorsuch received.

Voters say Biden is a strong leader by 5 points, while they think Trump is not by 4 points.

Among groups, Biden owes his lead mainly to support from women (+19 points), especially suburban women (+25 points), Hispanics (+43), and voters under age 35 (+43).

Trump is favored by Whites (+9 points), White women without a college degree (+10), White Catholics (+11), rural voters (+13), and White men without a college degree (+19).

In 2016, Trump won men by 11 points and those ages 65+ by 9, according to Pew Research Center validated voter data. The new survey finds Biden with a slight edge among seniors (+2 points) and men (+1).

Equal numbers of Biden (75 percent) and Trump (77 percent) backers are extremely committed to their candidate and extremely interested in the election (65 and 66 percent respectively).

Voters planning to cast a ballot by mail favor Biden by 41 points, while Trump leads by 11 points among those planning to vote in person.

Pollpourri

Among registered voters:

-- More voters like Biden than Trump, and that’s increasingly true. Biden’s favorable ratings are net positive by 16 points (57 favorable vs. 41 unfavorable), while Trump’s are underwater by 10 (44-54). The president’s favorable is down 3 points from his record 47 percent in April. Since that time, Biden’s favorable is up 9 points (48 percent in April).

-- Views of Vice President Mike Pence are more negative than positive by 1 point (47 favorable vs. 48 unfavorable), while views of Kamala Harris are net positive by 13 (53-40).

-- An increasing number think neighbors support Trump. By an 11-point margin, more think their neighbors are for Trump than Biden. In August, that was a 5-point spread. Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News survey with Republican Daron Shaw, believes more voters thinking their neighbors are for Trump is due to, “a combination of 2016 PTSD and liberal anxiety.” More Democrats say their neighbors back Trump (22 percent) than Republicans think theirs support Biden (9 percent), and very liberals (34 percent) are nearly three times as likely as very conservatives (13 percent) to think others are voting for the competition.

-- Trump’s job rating mostly holds steady, as 47 percent approve and 52 percent disapprove. Last month, it was 48-51 percent. While approval of Trump has never hit 50 percent, it was 49-49 percent in April. He’s leaving votes on the table, as more voters approve of his job performance than are supporting him in the race against Biden.

-- A record 41 percent see the disruption Trump has brought to Washington as a good thing, up from 35 percent two years ago. Still, a majority of 52 percent sees it as a bad thing, including 10 percent of Republicans and 7 percent of Trump supporters.

-- Views on abortion remain divided: 53 percent think it should be legal all (31 percent) or most of the time (22 percent), while 45 percent say illegal all the time (9 percent) or except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother (36 percent). Last June, it was 50-46 percent.

-- Views are more lopsided on Roe v. Wade. By a 61-28 percent margin, voters say the Supreme Court should let it stand. Most Democrats (69 percent) say abortion should be legal and want Roe to stand (76 percent). For Republicans, most (63 percent) think abortion should be illegal, yet they split on Roe, as 44 percent say it should be overturned, while 42 percent say let it stand.

-- Who won the first presidential debate? Eight in 10 Biden supporters think he won, while 6 in 10 Trump supporters say the president won. Overall, voters think Biden won by a 44-29 percent margin, 11 percent say tie/no one, and 16 percent are unsure.

Conducted October 3-6, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,107 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The survey includes results among 1,012 likely voters. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for both registered and likely voters.

Election 1 day away: Trump to blitz 4 key states as Biden hones in on Pennsylvania,"As the presidential race draws to a close, President Trump is slated to make a last-minute appeal to voters in four battleground states with a dizzying number of campaign rallies while his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, focuses heavily on Pennsylvania.

After a campaign stop in Cleveland, Ohio, Biden will head to Pennsylvania for a canvassing event in Beaver County with union members and labor leaders; a drive-in rally in Pittsburgh to galvanize Black voters; and another drive-in event in Pittsburgh with Lady Gaga.

His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, will also be stumping across the state, with several planned campaign events culminating in a drive-in rally with John Legend in Philadelphia.

2020 ELECTION BALLOTS CAST SO FAR

Both campaigns see Pennsylvania as crucial to securing the necessary 270 electoral votes to win the White House. Trump narrowly won the state in 2016 against Hillary Clinton ‒ part of the ""blue wall"" that he knocked down ‒ but polls consistently show Biden leading in the Keystone State.

A new poll released Monday by Monmouth University found Biden with a seven percentage point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania in a high-turnout scenario, and a five percentage point lead in a low-turnout scenario.

But the Trump campaign views Pennsylvania as the most likely to flip red on Nov. 3, unlike Michigan and Wisconsin, where Biden holds a more comfortable lead. The president plans to campaign in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan twice. Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, will hold rallies in Michigan and Pennsylvania.

An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday shows Biden with a comfortable 10 percentage point lead nationally, but the race is much tighter in the key swing states candidates need to win to reach 270 electoral votes.

CLAWING BACK VOTES: 7 STATES ALLOW VOTERS TO RESUBMIT BALLOTS

Still, a New York Times and Siena College poll published this week found Biden holds a clear advantage over Trump in four of the most critical battleground states, boosted by support from voters who did not participate in the 2016 election. According to the poll, Biden is ahead of Trump in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, as well as Arizona and Florida — states that Trump won four years ago.

With 29 delegates up for grabs, Florida is one of the biggest prizes on Election Day. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 1.2 percentage points in Florida four years ago; if he loses it on Tuesday, his path to reelection would be considerably more difficult.

More than 94 million Americans have already cast their ballots in the lead-up to the Nov. 3 election, representing more than two-thirds of total voter turnout in the 2016 election, according to data provided by the University of Florida's Election Project.

FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VOTE CAST USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

Biden has previously expressed confidence in his odds of winning Wisconsin and Michigan and has also ventured into traditionally red states in the campaign's final weeks with trips to Iowa and Georgia.

“I am not overconfident about anything,” Biden told reporters one week ago. “I just want to make sure we can earn every vote possible.”

In the final leg of the campaign, Biden is seeking to frame the battle for the White House as a referendum on Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic. The candidate, following a virtual briefing from public health officials, delivered a speech from Wilmington, Del., on Wednesday addressing the virus-induced crisis.

BIDEN MOVES ON COURT-PACKING STANCE, WHILE TRUMP SPARS WITH NBC IN DUELING TOWN HALLS

""Even if I win, it's going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic. I'm not running on the false promise of being to end this pandemic by flipping a switch,"" Biden said.“I do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things.”

The virus has infected more than 9 million Americans and killed 231,003, the most in the world.",,
Trump rally in Florida lasts until nearly 1AM despite area curfew,"President Donald Trump held a late-night rally in Florida on Sunday night, which appeared to last until about 1 a.m., despite a midnight curfew in place for the area.

Thousands of his supporters descended upon Miami-Opa locka Executive airport, located about 14 miles north of downtown Miami, in support of the president who ended a busy day of campaigning by making a final pitch to Florida voters.

""We're going to have an even bigger victory. Get out there and vote,"" Trump told the crowd. ""We're going to have a bigger victory. And I don't know if you found out you've been here a long time. I hope the music was good. I hope life was good. Everything was good. That's a good looking crowd. Good looking people, I will say.""

TRUMP'S COMMENT AT RALLY RAISES SPECULATION ABOUT FAUCI'S FUTURE AT NIAID

The packed ""Make America Great Again Victory Rally"" took place in Miami-Dade County, which has been described as the coronavirus epicenter in the state. Some wore masks, while others disregarded the face coverings.

In his speech, Trump criticized Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, lockdowns, and insisted the pandemic was ""rounding"" the turn.

""While foreign nations are in a freefall, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world,"" Trump said.

Trump also suggested he may fire Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, sometime after the election after some of his supporters at the rally were heard chanting ""Fire Fauci.""

Trump won Florida in 2016, but he lost Miami-Dade County by about 290,000 votes, according to the Miami Herald. The area is seen as significant to his reelection campaign this year.

Earlier on Sunday, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced that he would not lift a midnight curfew prior to the rally. The curfew has seen upwards of $500 fines issued by police to restaurants in violation, the paper reported.

""As we have done with recent late-ending sporting events, the County will be flexible on letting people travel home safely,"" he continued.

"As Anonymous admits lying, will the vitriol rage on after the election?","I’m going to put my name to this and not say it anonymously:

The whole flap over the New York Times op-ed by an unnamed author trashing President Trump is now making everyone look bad.

Now that Miles Taylor, who later published a book, has outed himself, he hardly fits the description of “senior administration official” that caused a furor as Washington wondered whether the person describing Trump as “petty and ineffective” was a Cabinet or sub-Cabinet official, or even someone in the White House.

Instead, it was the chief of staff to the secretary of Homeland Security--one of an army of Beltway bureaucrats and hardly part of the Trump inner circle. Even the Times says Taylor’s confession on Medium raises “questions about whether his position in the Trump administration was senior enough to justify the decisions by The Times’s Opinion desk and the book’s publisher to keep his identity secret.”

Had Taylor resigned and put his name on the piece, it would barely have caused a ripple. It was the Times that pumped up the Anonymous mystery by conveying the impression this was some big-shot insider who deserved journalistic protection.

Taylor, who left DHS last year, went public over the summer in TV hits by slamming his ex-boss--but not about his alter ego. In fact, he flatly lied to CNN’s Anderson Cooper when asked if he was Anonymous, saying he only wore masks for pandemics and Halloween.

ANONYMOUS OFFICIAL BEHIND INFAMOUS NYT OP-ED TO RELEASE BOOK ON TRUMP WHITE HOUSE

Now--you can’t make this up--he’s just been hired as a CNN contributor.

Chris Cuomo, to his credit, confronted Taylor Wednesday night. “You lied to us, Miles. You were asked in August if you were anonymous here with Anderson Cooper, and you said no. Now, why should CNN keep you on the payroll after lying like that?”

Taylor somehow tried to give himself a pass by saying he’d written in his book (and donated most of the proceeds) that he’d “strenuously deny” being the author. He said his original motivation was to avoid Trump’s predilection “to find personal attacks and distractions to pull people away from criticisms of his record.”

The president did just call Taylor a “sleazebag” who “should be prosecuted” (though there’s no evidence he broke any law). But Taylor’s rationale is really that he wanted to use the clout of the Times to whack Trump without being whacked back.

All this got me thinking about the legions of former Trump officials joining the Resistance and the Republican strategists joining forces through the Lincoln Project and other groups. And about how the husband of an actually senior White House official (George Conway) became famous for his scathing attacks on her boss. And how on the other side, the president and his allies have been blistering toward Joe Biden, the Democrats, the media and the administration’s opponents.

I’m not doubting anyone’s society, and politics has always been a rough game. But the president’s harshest critics often wrap their assaults in an aura of righteousness.

In a Times column using his actual name, David Brooks denounces Trump, praises Biden as “the personification of decency”--and raises questions about his own conduct and that of the hate-Trump crowd.

“Over the past four years we’ve poured out an hourly flow of anti-Trump diatribes and in almost every case they rise to the top of the charts — most liked, most retweeted, most read.”

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

The problem, Brooks says, is that “permanent indignation is not a healthy emotional state. We’ve become a little addicted to our own umbrage, addicted to that easy feeling of moral superiority, addicted to the easy affirmation bath we get when we repeat what we all believe. Trump-bashing has become a business model.”

“Addicted to our own umbrage” has a certain resonance. The fashionable thing in media circles is to blame the politics of hate on Donald Trump. But if Biden is sworn in next January, will much of the country simply aim its vitriol in different directions?

Will those on the left who have been demanding that the media and Congress hold the president accountable just roll over for Biden and defend everything he does?

Will those on the right who say this president has been victimized by fake news relentlessly attack Biden and the Democrats, castigating the press as lapdogs?

Will people continue to scream at each other on Twitter, sometimes using the Miles Taylor technique of doing it anonymously?

That sounds like a prescription for nonstop ugliness. And remember, it’s not like the pandemic will have magically vanished.",,
Media embrace Biden after dismissing him as a likely loser,"Many in the media are making the equivalent of a closing argument for Joe Biden, casting him as the right person at the right time.

There’s just one problem.

Most pundits had consigned him to history’s dustbin as the primaries got under way, laying out all the reasons why he wouldn’t--and shouldn’t--win the Democratic nomination.

So any praise for Biden in the final days of the general election has to come to grips with the earlier dismissals.

THESE 9 STATES COULD DECIDE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

There were some who said Biden would sink like a stone, others who urged him not to run. As I argued repeatedly at the time--and I was in the minority--the argument that Biden was too old, too out of touch and insufficiently liberal reflected a view that the party was much further to the left than it actually is. The Dems have become a far more liberal party, obviously, but left-wing Twitter is not where most of the rank and file are.

When the former vice president got walloped in Iowa and New Hampshire, the punditocracy tried to run him out of the race. How could this guy possibly go up against President Trump?

Win or lose, Biden has held onto his polling lead all year. And the reassessments are right on this point: the very qualities that made him seem hopelessly antiquated have turned out to be enduring strengths.

Biden is a fairly boring candidate. For some voters, that looks like a relief for what they view as the chaotic Trump years.

Biden has been around forever, as the president keeps reminding us with his “47 years” line. But that means the country knows him, including all his quirks and gaffes, so it’s harder for the Trump team to demonize him as either corrupt or a crazy socialist. Imagine how Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders would be faring under the GOP onslaught.

Biden keeps talking about cooperating with Republicans. That’s hardly a rousing battle cry and may be a fantasy, but it can sound appealing given the scorched-earth warfare, most recently over a Supreme Court seat.

Biden is uninspiring because he’s not pushing bold new ideas. But the reason he won the nomination after his South Carolina victory is precisely because he wouldn’t cave to left-wing pressure to back Medicare for All or a gargantuan Green New Deal.

Biden is slow-footed in a hyperspeed world. But it turns out that making little news--and not responding to every Trumpian tweet--has been a good way to make the race into a referendum on the president’s rhetoric and conduct. And while he’s clearly lost a couple of steps, the senile caricature certainly didn’t show up at the two debates.

Of course, it didn’t hurt that the media have gone easy on Biden--softball town halls, questions about ice cream, and no demands for more access as he has pursued a low-profile campaign, even after emerging from the Delaware basement.

Thus he is now being hailed with faint praise.

Veteran columnist Matt Bai says no one has ever accused Biden of being “an inspirational figure,” that he “risked going out as a joke rather than a statesman.”

When all the strategic geniuses were telling Biden to lurch left, Bai writes in the Washington Post, “he simply disagreed with his rivals, and he was willing to lose because of it. It was a principled last stand for which we never gave Biden the credit he deserved.”

He’s still a “plodder,” but “what we most need in a leader right now — decency, compassion, perspective — happen to be the very things Biden brings to the table.”

A Post news story strikes a similar theme: “Party factions feared Biden would fail to shore up the Democratic base or that he had lost a step because of his age. Allies fretted he would stumble in debates with President Trump and that his gaffes would give ample material to his tenacious opponent.”

Now the situation would look starkly different without the coronavirus. For one thing, Trump would be in a far stronger political position. But Biden’s play-it-safe, Zoom-style campaign would not have been possible without the devastation of Covid-19. Biden, at 77, has tried to contrast his black mask and cautious approach with the president’s White House events and big rallies.

Hey, luck is an underappreciated factor in politics. So is humility--which has been in short supply among many of the journalists who botched the rise of Trump four years ago and were positive that Biden would be long retired by now.",,
"In the frenetic final days, there’s still one major issue in this campaign","President Trump delivered on one of his core promises as Amy Coney Barrett was sworn in at the White House for a lifetime term on the Supreme Court.

Does that make it more likely that his supporters will turn out between now and Election Day? Or with three new conservative justices tilting the court sharply to the right, have Trump backers gotten what they wanted, making their choice less urgent?

It’s hard to know, amid a blizzard of polls and prognostication, what’s working and what isn’t in a campaign that most of the media expect Joe Biden to win.

SENATE CONFIRMS AMY CONEY BARRETT TO SUPREME COURT, CEMENTS 6-3 CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY

Will the Hunter Biden allegations be a major factor? “I don’t think it moves a single voter,” Republican Sen. Ted Cruz told “Axios on HBO.” And I suspect he’s right.

Will Barack Obama’s stump speeches move the needle for his former vice president? Maybe slightly. Will Trump’s attacks on Obama--and he again hit Fox News for airing the ex-president’s speech and those of Biden--have an impact? I doubt it. (The network has a responsibility to air significant events by both sides.) Nor will Trump’s criticism of Lesley Stahl (whose interview helped “60 Minutes” draw 17 million viewers) or Kristen Welker (which gave way to praise after the debate) flip a swing state.

Even the censorship efforts by Twitter and Facebook, as heavy-handed as they are, aren’t likely to tilt the outcome.

What about the candidates’ travels? Biden spent yesterday in Georgia, a red state since 1996, either lured by neck-and-neck polls or in an attempt to make the president play defense on favorable turf. Trump was in Nebraska, a slam-dunk state for him, while noting that Omaha is near Iowa, which is tight. The president’s repeated visits to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are an effort to keep the blue midwestern states he snatched from Hillary Clinton four years ago.

But in this strange election, how much do these trips matter? Would Hillary really have won Wisconsin if she had bothered to visit the state in the final days? Ordinarily I’d say Trump’s far heavier schedule gives him an advantage. But Biden doesn’t want to make as much news, preferring to cede the spotlight to Trump and cast the election as a referendum of the incumbent. The president revels in his large crowds, but to Biden these are reckless events in the coronavirus era--including the ones by Mike Pence after his recent exposure to staffers who tested positive.

My take is that the election--and this is tied to the fact that more than 64 million Americans have already voted--will turn on the virus. The recent surge to about 75,000 new daily cases all but guarantees that.

It’s Covid that triggered the nosedive afflicting every part of the economy, from restaurants and theaters to major airlines. It’s Covid that has limited many schools and colleges to virtual learning. It’s Covid that touches everyone’s life.

The president, who himself wound up getting the virus, keeps insisting we’re “turning the corner,” but that hasn’t happened yet. He has recently started blaming the media for overhyping the pandemic, calling CNN “dumb bastards” because its coverage has been “Covid Covid Covid Covid.”

Whether or not Trump is right that he avoided millions of deaths, or that the higher numbers are the result of more testing, places like Utah and Tennessee are warning of health care rationing and hospital bed shortages. The virus has hit many red states as hard as it hit New York and California last spring.

It’s not entirely clear what Biden would do differently. But as he campaigns to small audiences in his trademark black mask, the virus is obviously his number one issue.

In the end, the targeted travel, the rallies, the ad spending and the news-of-the-day attacks may marginally help one candidate or the other reach the magic number of 270. But I believe we will always look back on this as the Covid election.",,
Johnny 'Joey' Jones: America's gun vote will matter in this election,"My dad died in December of last year. In my arms, in my home, and in a moment. Before the calendar turned and the ball fell, before cities burned and before a virus from China threatened our lives and livelihoods.

But even then, he knew how fickle safety and security could be. He didn’t partake in conspiracy theories or prep for some inevitable disaster. In fact, he voted as a blue dog Democrat most of his life. That was until we were attacked on Sept. 11, 2001.

He knew few things about government or politics, but he knew that a man’s right and responsibility to defend his home, provide for his family, and make decisions for his own life were as necessary and American as the Constitution protecting such freedoms.

So, just a few weeks before Christmas, as he was known to do, he gave me his last gift. My entire inheritance, a Remington Woodsmaster Model 742 chambered in 30-06. A “Jammaster,” as these early model semi-automatic hunting rifles are so affectionately called in the gun community.

DONALD TRUMP: REELECT ME AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER SAFETY, PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS

His words were simple, “Son, I know you have all those fancy guns, but this one’s been with me since I was 16 years old. It’s never jammed on me, I never missed with it. It put food on the table, and protected us for 40 years. And I want you to have it.”

That very sentiment is exactly what’s on the ballot in 2020.

The radical left would have you believe they only seek to ban, or restrict, or take away “guns of war.” These are “assault rifles,” as they love to say. But a 1960s, wooden stock, deer rifle like my dad’s is as deadly and more powerful than any AR-15 on the market.

JOE BIDEN: I WANT YOUR VOTE TO BECOME YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT — HERE’S WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU AND OUR NATION

An assault on one undefinable group of guns is no doubt an assault on all popular sporting and defense rifles. Among their thinly veiled attempts to disarm our citizenry, even my dad’s legal ability to pass that gun to me, his son, with a handshake and a hug is in jeopardy when you have the likes of failed Texas politician, Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke, promised a seat in a Biden administration.

The conversation surrounding our Second Amendment has been largely ignored this election cycle. Notwithstanding a line from President Trump at every rally, the rest of the political machine, including politicians, media and their organizational support, have completely ignored this issue.

Why? Because Democrats know they have lost on this topic. Democrats see that the American people are rewarding pro-gun politicians and policies and have left this hot topic on ice for the 2020 election.

After four years of exploiting tragedies and singling out the National Rifle Association, with nothing more than a less than overwhelming midterm win in 2018 to show for it, Democrats are seeing right now, today, that the American people are moving toward gun ownership.

Perhaps this is a rapid response to state governments’ authoritarian policies dealing with COVID-19, and riots breaking out all over the country, and disasters like the California wildfires.

Just this week, Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice, giving the court a presumably 6-3 conservation majority on most heavily partisan cases. Although during Barrett’s confirmation hearings Senate Democrats focused largely on an ongoing case dealing with ObamaCare, it’s no small secret that Barrett’s placement on the high court locks in the Second Amendment-friendly majority Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas have been waiting for.

To those who may not believe the Second Amendment is a motivating factor for voters in places where it counts, let me be clear, the gun vote exists and we’re listening.

Today there are nearly 340 million guns in America, in 70 million homes. More than 40% of gun owners say they own a gun for self-defense. Common sense and conversations tell us that there must be a pretty strong correlation between the riots, movements to defund police, virus lockdowns and voters’ decisions at the ballot box. Especially in the Midwest, where Minneapolis became an epicenter of rioting and unrest.

The Second Amendment, our constitutional right to protect our home, family and life, isn’t a partisan issue.

President Trump won states like Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016 that many pollsters and consultants believed were an iron wall of Democrat voters. The gun vote undoubtedly played a role in a region where the opening day of deer season is a school holiday.

If growing metropolises in Texas and Georgia really do have these otherwise stalwart red states in play for Democrats, you can bet that gun owners will show up at the polls to have their voices heard. These two states particularly have rolled back restrictions on guns in recent year.

Just last year Texas passed a series of laws loosening gun restrictions.

But guns aren’t just an important issue to rural, red state voters. Nationally, gun sales and ownership have surged. I spoke with fellow Marine Corps veteran Shelby Lasater, director of marketing and business development at Glock Inc. Glock is one of the largest handgun manufactures in the U.S. and their iconic pistol is commonly used in movies and television.

I asked Shelby about the surge in gun sales this year. His response was succinct, “We are selling guns so fast we can’t produce them fast enough. We have dealers telling us that a lot of them are first time buyers.”

That statement is supported by self-reporting within the industry, as well as background check data reported by the FBI. Gun sales were up an annual 71% from January to July of 2020, with a record 5 million new gun owners. A National Shooting Sports Foundation survey showed that Black men and women made up 58% of new gun buyers, with women accounting for 40% of all gun sales. A study by UC Davis showed California had a gun sales spike of 500%. The state most famous for its restrictions on guns had lines sprawling around city blocks to get into gun stores all summer.

So, what should we learn from citizens like my late father, or the nation’s 5 million new gun owners, or the hundreds of thousands of new gun owners in a solidly blue state like California?

That the Second Amendment, our constitutional right to protect our home, family and life, isn’t a partisan issue. Yes, only one party is attempting to remove guns from our society, and, for the most part, only one party is trying to preserve this right. But for Americans outside the “Beltway,” and for those witnessing riots firsthand and reluctantly living in city-wide lockdowns, the right to own and possess a common firearm has never seemed more common sense.

I don’t believe we are a society on the brink of civil war. Nor that we’re on the eve of a revolution. However, I do believe that perhaps now more than any time since the West was won, we understand our inherent responsibilities and inalienable rights are, in fact, inseparable.

The right to true freedom commands the right to defend yourself and what’s yours, and the right to defend your own life demands the freedoms to do so. This isn’t a fight to save some antiquated lifestyle contained in remote parts of the country. No, this is a fight to defend, preserve and respect life itself, and the right of each citizen to do so, no matter where he or she resides in these United States.

Donna Brazile: Vote Biden — he can help us reclaim the soul of our nation after 4 nightmarish years of Trump,"The election that concludes Tuesday, in which more than 90 million Americans have already voted, is a battle for the soul of our great nation. The choice we face could not be more stark or important.

President Trump has failed every test of leadership, denies the reality of the coronavirus pandemic and other problems we face, and works to divide us. Former Vice President Joe Biden has a proven track record of effectiveness, has a realistic plan to end the pandemic, and has spent his entire adult life working to unite us and build a better future for every American.

I am proud to have already cast my ballot for my good friend Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. And I urge all of you who have not yet voted to vote for the Biden-Harris ticket as well. America needs a new partnership with a team ready to lead on Day One. They can help to save lives and end the abuses and lies Trump has engaged in on a daily basis.

RICHARD FOWLER: AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF TRUMP’S LIES, INCOMPETENCE, IGNORANCE AND FAILURES

When Vice President Gerald Ford became president in August 1974 following the resignation in disgrace of President Richard Nixon, Ford told the American people: “My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare if over.” If Joe Biden becomes our next president in January 2021, he can quote Ford’s words because Trump’s time in office has also been a national nightmare.

Despite all the tremendous harm Trump has done to our nation and institutions of government, despite the flames of racial division and strife that he has fanned, despite the many thousands of deaths he has caused with his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, I believe with all my heart that he has not destroyed America’s soul. Joe Biden can help us reclaim it.

My dear friend and hero, the late great civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., urged us to “get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and redeem the soul of America.” What did he mean?

I think Rep. Lewis meant that we Americans — of every race and ethnicity, rich and poor, haves and have-nots, in red and blue states — are all in this together. America’s soul is kept alive by the shared heartbeat of citizenship. As the old saying goes: united we stand — divided we fall.

His great wisdom shines within to us today, even though he is sadly no longer with us. May his memory be a blessing.

The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche could have been warning us about the disease of rancid partisanship over citizenship when he wrote: “Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.”

Sadly, in these hyper-partisan times, too many on the right think everyone on the left is a monster — and, I’m sorry to admit, visa-versa. Indeed, President Trump used that exact word — monster — to describe Sen. Harris, Joe Biden’s extraordinarily qualified running mate. It was as if Trump was claiming that Sen. Harris was somehow subhuman.

Folks, we’re all so busy fighting perceived monsters that we’ve lost sight of the fact that we’re losing the soul of our country. Poisonous, divisive words are widening the abyss between us.

Our two major political parties will always have disagreements on policy, and that’s only natural. Indeed, it’s healthy. But no president of the United States should use those disagreements to demonize his opponents, declare them criminals, and demand they be locked up. Yet Trump has done this repeatedly.

I’m not alone when I share my fear that we’re losing the spirit of citizenship that united our country in the bleak days following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. The same spirit enabled us to overcome the hate-filled and deadly summer of racial strife in 1968, following the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Bobby Kennedy. And the American spirit once again united all citizens following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

You don’t have to listen hard to hear the outlandish conspiracy theories of QAnon disinformation. During the final weeks until the presidential race is declared officially over — and please, God, let it not be the length of time we endured back in 2000 — this vitriolic rhetoric will be at full volume as the monsters fighting against democracy seek to vanquish what President Abraham Lincoln declared to be “the better angels of our nature.”

So I beg you, my fellow Americans on the right and the left of the political spectrum, ignore these monsters and instead work together to fulfill Rep. Lewis’ call to “redeem the soul of America.”

We need a president who talks not in terms of red or blue states, but rather the United States.

We need a president who doesn’t use the Oval Office to favor red states over blue states or rural areas over urban areas. We need a president who guides us away from chaos and the abyss, not an unstable man who careens out of control toward it.

We need a president who understands that the soul of America is in need of redemption — and who has the character empathy, wisdom, and experience to bring our country together.

Joe Biden is the president we need. He can end the long national nightmare of Trump’s dangerous war on democracy, civility, science, people of color, freedom of the press, and truth itself.

Now is not the time for men and women of goodwill who love our country to “stand by.” Now is the time to stand up and take a stand.

The White House and Congress do not get the last word. We, the American people, have the last word when we cast our ballots. John Lewis was nearly beaten to death fighting for Black Americans to get the right to vote. Dr. King was shot dead fighting for voting rights and an end to the sin of racism.

These great Americans and so many others in the civil rights movement and the women’s suffrage movement a century ago sacrificed everything and put their very lives on the line so every American citizen could vote to elect our leaders. We have a sacred obligation today to take advantage of that right — both to honor these saints of democracy and to ensure America has leaders who can best serve our nation.

Our votes matter now more than ever. Your vote is the best way to demand that our elected leaders act in the national interest — not to advance their personal interests and use the presidency to make millions of dollars, as Donald Trump has disgracefully done.

In the last debate, Trump absurdly compared himself to the great Republican President Lincoln. Well, let’s compare these two men.

Trump repeatedly and without a scintilla of evidence questions the legitimacy of our electoral process. Lincoln, on the other hand, noted: “Elections belong to the people. If they decide to turn their backs on the fire and burn their behinds, they will just have to sit on their blisters.”

Lincoln’s sage advice is especially true in this presidential election, which could very well determine the future of elections in our country — not just their outcomes, but also their accepted validity.

So I urge all Americans to do more than just vote in this election. We must work to protect our democracy, to preserve our rule of law, and to work for a nation that provides equal justice under the law for all.

If ever there was a time to cause what John Lewis called “good trouble” it is now — before the deadline to vote ends.

As Rep. Lewis — known as “the conscience of the Congress” — reminded us: “The right to vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democracy.”

Rarely has the soul of our country been more in need of redemption. So let’s vote to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats to the U.S. Senate and House who will restore civility, uphold America’s most cherished democratic principles, and lead us united into a brighter future. Hallelujah!

Dr. Marc Siegel: Biden's coronavirus plan – more details needed for a fair comparison to Trump's response,"Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted this weekend that “President Trump still has no plan to address COVID-19.”

And the latest Fox News poll shows that voters trust Biden over Trump on coronavirus by an increasing amount and only two out of 10 think the virus is under control in the U.S.

But what is Biden’s plan? The answer is that it is part increased government control and expenditure, part amplifying biotechnical accomplishments that are already in place, and part yet to be defined.

DR. MARC SIEGEL: TO DEFEAT CORONAVIRUS, WE MUST DO THIS

The president’s plan is to be found in the details of what he’s done to try to manage the pandemic, beginning with restricting travel from China in late January, to forming a Lincolnesque team of rivals task force in March that has worked tirelessly even if they often haven’t agreed with each other or the president, to restricting travel from Europe in June, to assembling a public/private partnership enabled by the Defense Production Act.

Under Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, millions of the components of PPE were generated, as were thousands of ventilators. And COVID therapeutics have emerged, from the anti-viral Remdesivir and monoclonal antibodies for early in the clinical course to dexamethasone and anti-coagulants for hospitalized patients.

The promising vaccines under Operation Warp Speed have progressed at an unprecedented rate, and it now looks look the Pfizer or Moderna messenger RNA vaccines could be ready for use in high-risk groups as early as late fall or early winter.

Biden has a plan to combat COVID posted on his website. How does it differ from the president’s plan?

For one thing, he states that he will “make testing widely available and free.” But the Families First Coronavirus Response Act already ensures that COVID-19 testing is free to anyone in the U.S., including the uninsured.

And HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. and Dr. Brett Giroir told me in an interview on SiriusXM last week that over 100 million rapid tests of the Abbott BinaxNOW antigen tests have been sent to the states, where high-risk areas, including nursing homes, are a priority.

He is also excited about the point of care Cue Health test, a cartridge-based molecular test that Giroir said is “99 percent accurate” and delivers results in 20 minutes. HHS and the Defense Department have invested $481 million in this test and Giroir envisions 100,000 tests a day being available by March mostly to confirm results of the Abbott antigen test.

Nevertheless, at this time, we still lack testing, and there is often a several-day delay, especially on the gold standard PCR tests, which undermines the crucial process of isolation and contact tracing to prevent spread. Free widespread rapid testing will be crucial to controlling the pandemic, no matter who is president.

There is a big difference between the two candidates in terms of how to best control both the virus and its cost.

Biden’s plan also promises “a decisive economic response that starts with emergency paid leave for all those affected by the outbreak.”

Currently, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act provides for two weeks of paid leave for those who are quarantined or sick from COVID-19. But the economic toll from the pandemic is enormous. An article in JAMA Network in October puts the overall loss in terms of work output and health reduction as $16 trillion.

There is a big difference between the two candidates in terms of how to best control both the virus and its cost. Whereas the president is focused on reopening and saving businesses, the former vice president is focused on viral control, masking and lockdowns if necessary.

Masks are clearly useful in helping stop the spread of the virus, especially if worn properly and used in conjunction with the all-important social distancing. In fact, several studies have shown that mandates have value, most recently in Tennessee, where an analysis from Vanderbilt revealed a link between mask mandates and lower hospitalizations. Biden’s commitment to mask mandates is supported by public health experts.

But Biden’s commitment to more lockdowns if needed has much less broad support. Dr. Anthony Fauci has expressed to me and others serious reservations about a national lockdown. Dr. Scott Atlas, health policy expert and an adviser to President Trump, said to me, “anyone even contemplating more restrictions on schools, families and businesses has not learned a thing about the pandemic. Those shutdowns are enormously harmful, especially to working-class families, and then once you reopen, the virus returns. That policy is contrary to the data; it is based on fear.”

When it comes to COVID-19, whoever wins Tuesday’s election for president will step into a situation where case numbers are skyrocketing and hospitalizations are on the way up. At the same time, therapeutics are ramping up, vaccines are coming soon, and rapid testing is becoming more widespread and readily available.

If your choice for president can provide a strategy for ensuring public health compliance while helping our economy to survive and thrive, then you’ve picked a winner.

Susan Molinari: Why Joe Biden has the support of this former Republican congresswoman,"I’m a third-generation Republican officeholder and proud of it. I served in the U.S. Congress for five terms; I was elected vice chairwoman of the Republican Conference; and I delivered the keynote address at the 1996 Republican National Convention. And I’m here to tell you why I’m voting for Joe Biden.

The COVID-19 pandemic has killed over 222,000 Americans, infected over 8 million fellow citizens, and decimated our economy. Yet, President Trump continues to deny the seriousness of COVID-19.

He knowingly and willfully lied to us at the beginning of this crisis, and he continues to do so now as he claims we are “rounding the corner.” He has no plan to effectively contain the virus. He dismisses our public health experts and scientists as “idiots.” And even after hosting a super spreader event at the White House, he tells us we shouldn’t let it control our lives.

DR. MARC SIEGEL: BIDEN'S CORONAVIRUS PLAN – MORE DETAILS NEEDED FOR A FAIR COMPARISON TO TRUMP'S RESPONSE

This behavior defies logic, and worse, it is costing lives and livelihoods in every corner of our country.

It’s never been more clear that we need real leadership.

I’ve worked with Joe Biden in Congress. He is a good man, and he’s what our nation needs during this time of crisis. He’s honest, he’s compassionate, and he values each of us.

During our time serving in Congress together, I saw Biden countless times listening to those around him when others left the room and standing up for those who needed a voice when no one else was paying attention. From authoring the Violence Against Women Act to standing up for human rights around the world, Joe Biden is a champion for everyone.

And Joe knows what we have to do to get through this crisis. He has a plan to contain COVID-19 and take steps that should have been taken months ago, including providing free testing and treatment and ensuring personal protective equipment and other supplies are available for all.

The Joe I know won’t just be a president for Democrats. He will be an American president.

Joe will listen to the experts, follow the science, and be honest with the American people so that we can safely reopen our schools and get back to our jobs. Our economy will never recover until we get this virus under control.

While I know it might not be easy for Republicans to vote for a Democrat, I promise you this: the Joe I know won’t just be a president for Democrats. He will be an American president. He will work with both parties for all of us – even those who don’t support him – to get us through this crisis, recover and build our country and our economy back better.

Justin Haskins: Early voting – Is US headed for post-election chaos?,"Although the 2020 election will almost certainly be remembered as one of the most consequential of the past half-century for its far-reaching impact on the country’s future, unless President Donald Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden wins in an Electoral College landslide, the race might be best remembered for its post-election chaos.

Never before has the country experienced an election like this one.

Spurred by fears of the coronavirus pandemic, early-voting records are being smashed across the United States. Some states, including Texas, are on pace to have hundreds of thousands, and perhaps millions, of additional ballots cast in 2020 than in 2016. And now, more than ever, voters are depending on mail-in ballots to cast their votes.

BRIAN ARBOUR: WHAT EARLY VOTING NUMBERS DO AND DO NOT MEAN

These conditions, mixed with the mass civil unrest that occurred throughout the summer and early fall, have created a potentially disastrous cocktail of circumstances that could lead to violence, widespread destruction of property and the undermining of Americans’ faith in the electoral process.

At the root of the problem is state governments’ newfound adoption of mail-in voting.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, only a handful of states allowed all registered voters to cast their ballots through the mail. But now, widespread mail-in voting is permitted in nearly every corner of the United States.

Only five states – Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas – provide substantial limits on who can cast their ballots from home.

Despite claims to the contrary from supporters, mail-in balloting significantly increases the likelihood of voter fraud and lost or rejected ballots. One need not look far to find numerous examples of problems.

According to an Oct, 29 report by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, less than a week before Election Day, thousands of voters in Butler County, Pa., were still waiting to receive their mail-in ballots.

“Nearly 40,000 registered voters in the county requested mail ballots,” the Post-Gazette reported. “So far, only 24% of them have been returned to the county, by far the lowest rate among the state’s 67 counties. The county with the next-lowest return rate, Fayette, has received 50% of requested ballots.”

The possibility that tens of thousands of voters in Butler and Fayette Counties may not end up voting in the 2020 election due to incompetence is proof of the major impact mail-in balloting could have on the outcome of the 2020 race. Pennsylvania is one of the most important swing states in the presidential race, and more than 60 percent of voters in both Butler and Fayette Counties voted heavily in favor of President Trump in 2016.

Pennsylvania isn’t the only state already experiencing problems with mail-in balloting. On Thursday in Detroit, city officials announced 500 absentee ballots had been “spoiled” and won’t be counted. Voters with spoiled ballots will need to cast their ballots again if they want their vote to count in 2020.

In Billings, Mont., voters casting their ballots by mail have reported stolen ballots and instances of ballots being taken out of mailboxes and ripped to shreds by unknown fraudsters.

As crazy as it sounds, having more than 1 million ballots tossed could be a best-case scenario.

On Tuesday, two men in Miami, Fla., were arrested for stealing ballots.

In Missouri, 1,200 absentee ballots were lost in the mail.

In Wisconsin, three trays of mail, including absentee ballots, were discovered in a ditch near the Appleton International Airport.

Earlier in October, a postal worker in New Jersey was arrested for dumping 2,000 pieces of mail, including 100 ballots and more than 200 political flyers.

In Franklin County, Ohio, 50,000 voters received incorrect mail-in ballots. According to a report by the Associated Press, “Some ballots had an incorrect congressional race, while others had the correct information but were sent to voters in a different precinct.”

In September in New York City, more than 100,000 ballots were sent out to voters with incorrect names, addresses and other information printed on the return envelopes, causing widespread confusion.

Additionally, mail-in voting makes it easy for in-family voter fraud to occur, a problem that is virtually impossible to track and has received very little attention.

In many states, mail-in ballots only require basic information and a signature, all of which could easily be obtained by a close family member, who could then use an absentee ballot to illegally cast a vote for the candidate of his or her choosing – perhaps without the knowledge of the person whose vote was stolen.

These problems are just the beginning. Analysts are expecting a massive number of ballots to be thrown out by election officials because they were improperly filled out by voters or because signatures do not match those on record.

A report by NBC News notes that researchers studying absentee balloting estimate “1 percent to 2 percent of those votes – potentially more than 1 million – won’t count, which could make a difference in battleground states.”

As crazy as it sounds, having more than 1 million ballots tossed could be a best-case scenario.

During the 2020 primaries in New York City, more than one in five ballots sent by mail were rejected by election officials.

During North Carolina’s primaries, 9 percent of mail-in ballots were rejected, and state officials say they are hoping only 3 percent are rejected in the general election, a number that could be large enough to swing numerous state and federal races, depending on how many voters in the state choose to vote by mail.

It is entirely possible that given the high voter turnout and exceptionally high number of voters choosing to vote by mail, a few million ballots could end up being rejected nationwide.

These problems, coupled with concerns over more traditional forms of voter fraud, will likely be used by losing candidates at the local, state and federal levels, along with their supporters, as proof that the election was “stolen,” “fraudulent” or otherwise invalid, causing widespread distrust about the validity of the results.

And if the number of ballots thrown out surpasses the margin of victory in a given race – a scenario that is likely to occur in at least several high-profile elections – who could blame the losing candidate for questioning the outcome?

The United States is on an incredibly dangerous road. If a significant number of important races – especially the presidential election – are considered invalid by a large proportion of the electorate, it’s hard to imagine a post-election scenario that would allow the country to move forward on firm ground for years to come.

A free society will not last for long if the citizens of that nation stop believing in the validity of their elections.

The worst part is that all of this was avoidable. There were plenty of alternatives to mail-in balloting that would have allowed most people to vote safely in person in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

But, unfortunately, that ship has sailed. All Americans can do now is hope for as few close races as possible – and to learn from the mistakes made by the politicians who created these absurd voting policies prior to this year’s election.

Brian Arbour: What early voting numbers do and do not mean,"It’s 2020, and everything is different. Some things are a little different, and some things are a lot different.

One of the things that is a lot different this year is early voting. More people are doing it than in previous years. A lot more.

The U.S. Elections Project reports that over 92 million ballots have already been received by election officials, as of Sunday morning. This not only outpaces the 47 million early votes recorded in 2016, but is nearly two-thirds of the nearly 139 million votes cast in that election. Leading the way in early voting is Texas; more votes have been cast early in the Lone Star State in 2020 than were cast in the entire 2016 election.

NEWT GINGRICH: WILL TRUMP WIN? YES. I THINK HISTORY WILL REPEAT ITSELF – HERE'S WHY

I am one of those 92 million. The state of New Jersey sent ballots by mail to every registered voter in the state. I took my ballot to our town hall, and let my 8-year old son have the honors of putting it in the dropbox.

The increase in early voting this year has led to much speculation on what these results will mean for election night. Does one candidate or party have an advantage due to the geographic, racial, age or partisan composition of early voters?

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

But my voting story helps to explain why these efforts are futile. Many of those who are voting early this year are regular voters who are choosing to vote early because, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, states have expanded early voting options to reduce crowds on Election Day.

As a result, we have less information about who is going to vote on Election Day itself, and who it will benefit. Will it be a strong or a weak turnout? Will Election Day turnout come more from one group or another? We can estimate and make predictions, but we do not know.

While 2020 has compelled changes large and small in different areas of American life, one area where it has not produced changes is in attempts to divine clues about election results from early voting data. Pundits on editorial pages and in social media try to parse through the early voting numbers to identify advantages for one side or the other. These rarely turn out to be correct.

The changes 2020 has wrought on election administration has made it more difficult, if not impossible, to read the tea leaves provided by early voting data. There are two reasons for this.

First, the increase in early voting means that there is no historical pattern of voting behavior that one can use to assess this year’s early vote. And second, polling data indicates that there is a great partisan difference in whether voters are going to vote early or on Election Day. These facts make it nearly impossible to determine what advantages one candidate has in early, or in Election Day voting.

As discussed, I usually vote on Election Day but was able to vote early this year. This is is very common; political science research and election analysis have long found that early voting usually cannibalizes Election Day voting. Certainly, some of those who have voted already are new or sporadic voters who did not vote in 2016. But the vast majority of those who have voted are regular voters, even if they usually vote on Election Day.

Thus, more early votes in 2020 mean fewer Election Day voters, especially among those who are regular voters. Who is left to vote on Election Day? It will not be the usual set of people. Because both early voters and Election Day voters are different from the usual sets who select each option, we lack the ability to compare each group to subsets of voters from 2016, or any other previous election.

It is difficult to parse advantages in early voting data even under the best of circumstances.

If early voters in 2020 are younger or more urban than those who voted in 2016, we don’t really know if that means the entire electorate will be younger or more urban than previous electorates, or if more of those voters chose to vote early in 2020 than in previous years.

Early vote analysis this year is also confounded by partisan differences in when to vote. This year, the most committed Republicans seem to be following the cues provided by the nation’s top Republican – President Donald Trump – that early voting by mail is “unfair,” a “disaster” and a “scam.” Poll results and early voting data show that Democrats favor voting by mail, which is the most common form of early voting being used this year.

Our Fox News polls show the partisan dichotomy on how to vote. Our most recent set of polls asked voters in four Rust Belt states if they would vote early or if they would vote in person on Election Day. In the swing state of Wisconsin, those who have or are planning on voting early favored Biden 65-28. Those who will cast their votes in person on Election Day favor President Trump 37-56. Our polls showed similar results in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

We see more Democrats voting early, and we will see more Republicans show up at the polls next Tuesday. Will the Republican Election Day surge match the early voting efforts of Democrats? We do not know now, and will not know the answer until next Tuesday.

So what should you do if you read an article, view a social media post, or hear chatter from a friend or family member about how some bit of early voting data portends victory or doom for your favored candidate? Take it with a grain – nay, a pillar – of salt.

It is difficult to parse advantages in early voting data even under the best of circumstances. Trying to do it in 2020 is near impossible. We will all have to wait until actual results are released on election night to know what the early voting numbers – and the Election Day numbers – mean.

"Sen. Tom Udall: Vote Joe Biden — he will defeat coronavirus, rebuild our economy and fight for you","For most Americans, this year has presented challenges unlike any we’ve ever experienced. More than 229,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Millions more are out of work because of the resulting economic crisis. Businesses have shuttered — some for good. Schools are closed. Life has been upended.

Even at this moment of immense pain for the nation, we are witnessing the best of the United States. Essential workers and health care workers have stepped up to serve their communities. Many Americans are donating their time or resources to a local charity or food bank.

But the fact is, while so many Americans are asking how they can help right now, the American people haven’t gotten the help they need and deserve from their leaders. The COVID-19 crisis has not been a failure of the American people. It has been a failure of leadership.

RICHARD FOWLER: AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF TRUMP’S LIES, INCOMPETENCE, IGNORANCE AND FAILURES

President Trump and his administration are not responsible for the coronavirus. But they are responsible for their failure to respond to it effectively.

They failed to develop a national strategy to contain this virus so our economy could come back, schools could open their doors, and people could get back to their lives.

They failed to promote the best, science-proven strategies to slow the spread, instead setting a poor example for the nation and our children.

They failed to mobilize to ensure our health care workers had the personal protective equipment and supplies to keep themselves and our communities safe.

And they failed to show leadership — to bring Republicans and Democrats together on another relief package to give struggling Americans the resources they need to stay on their feet.

So as we approach Election Day, the American people have a choice.

They can choose to continue down the path we’re on — with a president who insists at the worst moment of the pandemic that ""we are turning the corner,"" and who has no plan in place to defeat this virus so we can get back to normal, American life.

Or they can pick a new path — where we take decisive action to beat COVID-19 and to build back our economy and our country better. That’s the path offered by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California.

In contrast to the current president, Joe Biden has articulated a plan for how we will defeat COVID-19. He will listen to the scientists — encouraging proven steps like mask-wearing and social distancing, instead of burying our heads in the sand.

Joe Biden will develop our capacity for widespread, free, rapid testing and contact tracing to crush the virus. He will protect your health care, instead of trying to take it away during a pandemic, as the Trump administration is trying to do.

And Joe Biden will show the leadership necessary to deliver the economic relief that struggling Americans so desperately need.

During this pandemic, President Trump has cheered as the richest Americans have actually gotten even richer — by the billions, boosted by the Trump tax cut for the wealthiest few. Meanwhile, working people are losing ground, having difficulty making ends meet and putting food on the table.

Newt Gingrich: Will Trump win? Yes. I think history will repeat itself – here's why,"In 1964, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater asked Ronald Reagan to deliver a nationally televised speech on behalf of his campaign. The speech was called “A Time for Choosing.”

In his address, Reagan made the point that freedom was at stake — that we’re always taking a step toward either more freedom or more tyranny. Reagan noted that, for several thousand years, man had gradually worked to create the rule of law; to establish the right of a free people who insist their liberties come from God, not government; and to limit the power of those who would exploit us, bully us, and dominate us.

In 2020, we have seen the re-emergence of tyranny in America to a degree that I would have thought impossible were I not living through it.

Across the country, Democratic leaders and their allies have trampled rights, censored speech, and hidden the truth from the American people.

DONALD TRUMP: REELECT ME AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER SAFETY, PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS

Americans have a choice on Election Day to continue further down this tyrannical path or step back from the brink and recapture our God-given freedoms. I discuss this choice — the stakes of the election — on this week’s episode of my podcast, “Newt’s World.”

Most egregiously, Democratic governors have abused their power during the coronavirus pandemic, discarding the Constitution to impose arbitrary bans that crush our liberty.

In Nevada, for example, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak reopened casinos with few restrictions but severely limited the number of people who could go to church.

In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo targeted New York City’s Orthodox Jews in what can only be described as an anti-Semitic attack.

In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer banned people from using their boats — although her husband thought he was the sole exception.

JOE BIDEN: I WANT YOUR VOTE TO BECOME YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT — HERE’S WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU AND OUR NATION

We’ve also seen Big Tech, especially Facebook and Twitter, try to imitate the Chinese Communist Party by censoring political stories they find inconvenient. These tech giants are spreading across the country a San Francisco radicalism personified by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

And then of course there’s the elite media, which has become a collection of propaganda outfits dedicated to protecting Joe Biden and other Democrats — even from confirmed reports of corrupt business dealings. Imagine if Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were told in 1972 not to pursue the Watergate scandal — after all, what’s a little corruption among friends? That’s what the media is doing today.

In short, what we’re witnessing is an undermining of the United States of America — not just by the above forces but also by Black Lives Matter rioters and Antifa anarchists.

NEWT GINGRICH: A 2020 ELECTION FABLE -- THE BUNNY RABBIT, THE BEAR, AND THE BEES

In this environment, the 2020 election is occurring at one of the most amazing and consequential times in modern history. Indeed, this election is the most important one since 1864, when America would have died if Abraham Lincoln were not re-elected.

A victory for Donald Trump would be an American populous uprising against all the large systems that would sell out to the Chinese, give up the American dream, and suppress the political right.

But will President Trump be re-elected? I think so. If you examine the crowds at the president’s rallies, you’ll find not only a significant number of people who have never before voted but also many Democrats. Plus, in virtually every state-wide poll, we see Trump at a minimum doubling his share of the African American vote.

Furthermore, we’re discovering that a number of people may not like Trump but are totally unimpressed with Biden.

Voters have to ask themselves whether they really trust a man who hides in his basement and a San Francisco radical running the country — especially when we’ve seen President Trump oversee a historically strong economy and not get involved in any more wars.

Perhaps most importantly, recall that on Election Day in 2016, Nate Silver and the New York Times said Hillary Clinton had an 85 percent chance of winning. Look what happened next.

But we can’t assume that history will repeat itself, although I expect it to. All Americans who care about the future of their country must go out and vote and urge their friends and family to do the same.

Juan Williams: Trump and Republicans work to suppress Democratic votes,"The recent sight of people standing in long lines to vote — some waiting as long as 11 hours in Georgia — made me so proud to be an American that I couldn’t speak.

I just pointed at the TV to show my wife why I was choked up.

Americans holding tight to their right to vote are to my mind the essence of taking pride in a national government that is “of the people, by the people, for the people,” as President Abraham Lincoln put in his Gettysburg Address.

DEMS GRASP AT OPPORTUNITIES IN RED STATES AS ELECTION DAY LOOMS

In a modern America, where overnight delivery and fast food are the norm, the sight of people giving up hours of their time to vote is pure patriotism — a defiant act to protect our form of democratic governance.

Over the past four years President Trump — with the help of too many state Republican Party officials — has tried to put a friendly face on suppressing the votes of people who do not vote for him.



Trump gave the game away in March when he dismissed Democratic efforts to include protections to keep polling places open, and allow for same-day registration and early voting in the first coronavirus relief legislative package.



“The things they had in there were crazy … you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again,” Trump said in an interview on “Fox & Friends.”

Pay close attention to what the president said. If there are no limits on Americans turning out to vote, he thinks he will lose his reelection bid.

Trump’s reasoning is based on the results of recent presidential elections. Since 1988, the GOP has won the majority of votes in a presidential race only once – President Bush in 2004.

And as the years go by, the number of young and minority Americans in big cities and suburbs — areas that typically vote for Democrats — continues to grow.

Meanwhile, the number of White people in rural areas who typically back Republicans has been shrinking.

These demographic facts have led the GOP and its supporters to spend $20 million on 300 court cases to oppose state and local laws that make it easier to vote, according to the Center for Public Integrity.

Republicans in some states have also tried to place limits on the number of polling places and sites for early voting.

And of course, there is a major Trump donor now running the U.S. Postal Service, who critics say has purposely tried to hamstring the delivery of mail-in ballots.

Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., found that mail in several big cities — including Philadelphia, Baltimore and Detroit — recently had delays 20% of the time.

The president, however, claims he is fighting voter fraud. The flaw in that argument is the lack of evidence of widespread voter fraud.

“The truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting, there’s no proof of widespread fraud,” Ben Ginsberg, one of the Republican Party’s top election lawyers, recently wrote in a Washington Post column.

“At most, there are isolated incidents — by both Democrats and Republicans,” Ginsberg wrote. “Elections are not rigged. Absentee ballots use the same process as mail-in ballots — different states use different labels for the same process.” He concluded that claims of widespread voter fraud are “unsustainable.”

But some political players do not bother to claim voter fraud in trying to stop people from voting.

In October, residents of a mostly Black poor Detroit neighborhood got robocalls warning that voting by mail could lead to debt collections and even being forced to take vaccinations.

These voter suppression efforts sometimes become public policy.

Georgia Republicans cut nearly 10% of the state’s polling places even as the number of voters increased.

“Voter suppression is preventing many from casting their ballots,” Martin Luther King III wrote on Twitter. The son of the civil rights leader told Georgia residents to “be prepared to protect your rights.”

There is a similar story in Texas. The state Supreme Court upheld an executive order from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott that each Texas county can have only one drop-off box for ballots. This means that Harris County — where the state’s biggest city, Houston, is located — has only one box. Note that more than 25% of the voters in Harris County are Black.

And there is a similarly upsetting story in Florida.

The state’s voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state Constitution in 2018 to restore voting rights for felons. But the Republicans in the Legislature responded by passing a law requiring that the former convicts pay all of their outstanding debts and court costs before they can vote.

Critics called the law a “modern-day poll tax,” but it was upheld by a federal court. Just 67,000 felons out of the newly-eligible population of 1.4 million successfully registered to vote this year.

So, to all Americans who stood in line, who defied any effort to block you from voting, I say thank you.

"Richard Fowler: Americans are tired of Trump’s lies, incompetence, ignorance and failures","The American people appear to have caught on to the conman in chief who occupies the Oval Office. President Trump is trailing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the polls because millions of Americans are tired of Trump’s lies, incompetence, ignorance and dismal record of failure upon failure — particularly regarding his response to the coronavirus pandemic.

More than 9 million Americans have been infected with the coronavirus and more than 229,000 have tragically died. No, Mr. President, we haven’t turned the corner on this virus. The pandemic is getting worse, and the White House has been absolutely nonresponsive.

And no, President Trump, hospitals aren’t at capacity simply because the American people have more access to testing. The truth is that our hospitals are filling up because more and more Americans are getting COVID-19, and as a result they are showing up at emergency rooms in droves.

JOE BIDEN: I WANT YOUR VOTE TO BECOME YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT — HERE’S WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU AND OUR NATION

We are not flattening curve on the pandemic, no matter how many times Trump claims that to be the case at his super-spreader rallies with thousands of unmasked supporters. COVID-19 is a clear and present danger and the American people are paying with their lives.

Already, more than 90 million Americans have cast ballots in the election that concludes Tuesday. Trump is responsible for the early voting, because his horrific mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic has convinced many of us that if we show up at the polls on Election Day we could risk contracting COVID-19.

It may take weeks for us to know the election results. That is because of both the heavy mail-in balloting and the multiple legal challenges Trump has mounted and is expected to mount to keep mail-in ballots from being counted.

Trump’s unwillingness to hear the voices of everyday Americans struggling with health deficiencies, unemployment and other economic woes is breathtaking. He continues his war on ObamaCare, and his administration will soon argue before the Supreme Court that the health care law should be thrown out — harming millions of Americans, especially those suffering with preexisting conditions.

I cast my vote for former Vice President Joe Biden with the acknowledgment that he is not the perfect candidate — nor does he claim to me.

Both Biden and Trump are older than the average American and have policy positions in their past that make them unpalatable to many in the American electorate. However, 2020 isn't actually about likeability. I voted for Biden and vice-presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., because this election is about decency, civility, problem-solving, and a leader’s effectiveness and competence. On all those marks, Biden has Trump beat by leaps and bounds.

The former vice president’s crystal-clear messaging and willingness to speak truthfully about the coronavirus and how to deal with it make him a natural choice for voters looking for commonsense solutions.

Biden accepts science, listens to experts and reads his briefings. Trump does none of these things, spouting one nonsensical claim after another based on misinformation.

Struggling American families are looking for leadership that will flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections, develop a national strategy, and bring some sanity to the White House. Trump has failed to provide it. Biden will be able to.

For the past seven months, educators, parents, and students alike have been living the COVID-19 reality that Trump and his White House have ignored. If you take a moment to listen to these long-suffering Americans, you would quickly find out that for them, we aren't turning the corner on COVID-19 — we are digging ourselves into a deeper ditch.

Whether it be the continually changing COVID-19 guidelines for returning to school, the haphazard re-openings and pandemic-induced closings, or the lack of a strategy around virtual learning, these often-ignored Americans live with COVID-19 as part of their daily reality.

As a nation, we need to deal with the facts: COVID-19 will be here for a while. It has had a negative impact on all of our lives. Teachers, parents, students, people who have lost their jobs and businesses, and millions of us mourning the unnecessary deaths of loved ones can’t ignore the pandemic just because Trump tells us we should.

COVID-19 has also laid bare the economic reality that is being faced by far too many Americans. Not only has this pandemic and Trump's mismanagement of it dismantled our economy — it has crippled the most vulnerable American families and the communities where they live and work.

Trump, a billionaire, is focused on the stock market. But only 55 percent of Americans are invested in the stock market. Many Americans are more focused on the supermarket and wondering how to afford groceries because they are living paycheck to paycheck — or no longer getting paychecks. They are struggling desperately to avoid both homelessness and hunger — as if they live in a Third World country and not the United States of America.

Because so many Americans still depend on unemployment insurance, food pantries and the help of friends and neighbors to survive, the lack of a real economic vision and fiscal stimulus from Washington is outrageous.

But Trump has given up on negotiating with Democrats to provide badly needed aid to American families, businesses, and state and local governments. He would rather spend his time holding super-spreader events that infect more Americans with COVID-19 and claim the pandemic is just about to end and a vaccine will be available “momentarily.”

Without a clear closing argument or a coherent strategy, Trump is losing this election and losing it badly. In 2016, he tapped into the frustrations and grievances of millions of unheard and forgotten Americans. But today, Trump's lack of empathy and sympathy, and his unwillingness to hear the American people's stories, have left him in a lurch.

Deafened by the cheers from his super-spreading campaign rallies, Trump is transfixed on the pre-COVID economy of yesterday, while most Americans are trying to figure out what they will do tomorrow.

Trump’s lack of concern and quickness to turn the page have opened the door for the naturally sympathetic Joe Biden to take center stage.

America is described by some as a land of milk and honey — rich with boundless opportunity. Others describe it as a bittersweet country trying to do the right thing in the face of inequity and imbalance. These two definitions characterize the state of this election and its potential outcome.

Truth be told, the results of the election will fall in between those two perspectives. I believe the race will be much closer than most pollsters and pundits have predicted. That’s why to determine the outcome of the election we must look no further than what’s happening to the American people and how ongoing developments affect their ballots. It’s not just about evaluating the candidates.

It takes little effort to look at Trump's record and assume that he will not be reelected. In addition to his dismal record or COVID-19 and the economy, he has supercharged racial hatred in this country by blowing far too many dog whistles and racial bullhorns to even count.

But sadly, Trump’s many failings and disgraceful behavior might not be enough to evict him from the White House. He continues to have a strong appeal to his base — witnesses the many people who continue turning out at his super-spreader rallies, endangering their lives and the lives of their loved ones and others they come in contact with.

The American people have been left to fend for themselves, with no leadership from Donald Trump and his White House. This should disgust all American voters and slingshot them to the polls. Millions of Americans are over Trump’s mismanagement and it’s time to let him know.

RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel: Republicans fighting Democratic attempts to steal election victory,"Democrats are transparent about their goals: raising taxes, eliminating oil and natural gas, packing the Supreme Court, and giving themselves every opportunity to sue their way to victory in the election now underway. Republicans are fighting them on all these counts.

Democrats have seized on the global coronavirus pandemic to not just limit our freedom, but to transform Election Day from Nov. 3 into Nov. 3 through Nov. 20, or whenever Democrats dig up enough ballots to declare victory, whichever comes first.

“Finding” late-arriving, non-postmarked ballots days after Election Day might be business as usual in tin-pot dictatorships, but it is no way to run an election in the United States of America. This is what left-wing groups want. They have tried to gut election laws through the courts in every battleground state across the country.

RNC CHAIR MCDANIEL: TRUMP’S RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS SHOWS HE DESERVES REELECTION

In response to this legal onslaught, the Republican National Committee has invested over $20 million and launched an unprecedented effort to protect the vote. We could not stand idly by and let Democrats strip away every ballot safeguard. Through our commitment to election integrity, we secured numerous victories.

We prevented paid organizers from trafficking in other people’s ballots, also known as ballot harvesting. Four people were indicted for engaging in this disreputable tactic in a fraudulent election in Paterson, N.J. Despite Democrats’ best efforts, the practice remains illegal in Arizona, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.

This week the Supreme Court blocked Democrats from changing the law to accept ballots for nearly a week after Election Day in Wisconsin.

In Maine, Hillary Clinton’s election-meddling lawyer Marc Elias sought to allow ballots to come in for 10 days after the polls closed. Our intervention stopped that from happening.

The Supreme Court reinstated South Carolina’s witness requirement for mail-in ballots.

Iowa’s state Supreme Court sided with the Republican National ‘Committee to ensure officials positively identify voters applying for absentee ballots — another important safeguard. We’ve fought to protect the vote across 23 states and secured dozens of major legal victories.

Radical Democratic groups are so desperate to use the pandemic to their advantage that they attacked even bipartisan election reforms.

Left-wing activists sought to reverse North Carolina’s recent bipartisan ban on ballot harvesting, gut absentee ballot witness signature requirements, and mandate ballots be mailed to voters who haven’t even asked for one. They were losing in court, so Democratic activists instead pursued collusive settlements.

After suing, they would pressure local Democratic officials to accept radical reforms they knew no court would order, like counting ballots nine days after the election. This backroom dealing led two members of the North Carolina Board of Elections to resign in protest. Democrats touted this as a “win” — for themselves alone, not for free and fair elections.

Democrats tried to turn every swing state into California, where Democratic ballots have a tendency to miraculously turn up after Election Day. But they know they have largely failed in this attempt to radically change state laws for partisan ends.

Marc Elias laments that it can be easy for “progressives to simply give up on the courts.” But the Democrats will stop at nothing. The same people who lied about hiring foreign spies to meddle in the 2016 election — and then used their Russian disinformation to try to delegitimize President Trump’s victory — are again meddling in 2020.

Worried they are losing this election, Democrats are changing the narrative. They are talking about long voter lines — in counties and cities run by Democrats. After their disastrous mail-in primaries in June that took up to six weeks for results, voters are waiting for up to five hours in New York City, and up to 10 hours in DeKalb County and Atlanta, Ga.

The Democratic excuse for their upcoming election loss will be so-called “voter suppression,” when in actuality illegal ballots will be disqualified for running afoul of integrity laws — like missing signatures, or ballots with signatures that do not match the voter’s signature on file.

"Mike Huckabee: America, has Joe Biden earned your vote?","American voters deserve a leader who is open about what he wants to do, and does it.

Unlike former Vice President Joe Biden, who continues to keep both himself and his radical agenda under wraps, President Trump told voters exactly what he planned to do when he was campaigning for the presidency in 2016 and shocked the political establishment by actually keeping his promises.

During his reelection campaign, the president has consistently pledged to protect and expand the policies that have made the American people far more prosperous than ever before, and we can count on him to do that in a second term.

In 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which now serves as the foundation of his economic platform. This tax legislation saves taxpayers an average of $1,400 on their federal taxes every year, expanded the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child, and helped create hundreds of thousands of jobs across the entire country.

DONALD TRUMP: REELECT ME AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER SAFETY, PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS

The TCJA also funds the “Opportunity Zones” initiative, which offers incentives for private sector growth and investment in communities with below-average incomes, and eliminated Obamacare’s individual mandate, which slapped a hefty penalty on Americans who either didn’t want or couldn’t afford health insurance coverage.

With somewhat less fanfare, President Trump also ended the war or fossil fuels that was waged by the Obama-Biden administration.

In just four short years, the president eliminated thousands of job-killing regulations — nearly eight of them for each new regulation his administration created — allowing America’s mighty energy sector to recover from the brink of despair.

JOE BIDEN: I WANT YOUR VOTE TO BECOME YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT — HERE’S WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU AND OUR NATION

As a direct result of these policies, as well as the emergency economic relief legislation that the president signed earlier this year, America’s mighty economic engine survived the shutdowns of the coronavirus pandemic and is now rapidly regaining its momentum. In fact, the U.S. economy has managed to regain more than 11.4 million jobs since April and posted record-shattering 33.1 percent GDP growth in the third quarter.

These are the types of results that the silent majority of American voters wanted in 2016 — and that is exactly what they got from President Trump.

America’s future under Biden, however, would be far less certain.

Like the career politician he is, Biden has tried to obscure his stance on some of the most important issues, denying that he would raise taxes on middle-income Americans or eliminate fossil fuels and the U.S. energy industry. Just months ago, however, Biden openly swore to do both of those things if he got elected president.

Most egregiously, Biden has adamantly refused to tell the American people whether he supports the Democrat push to “pack” the Supreme Court by adding enough new justices to tip the ideological balance back in liberals’ favor. He even arrogantly declared that Americans “don’t deserve” to know where he stands on this extremely important issue.

The media haven’t merely ignored Biden’s flip-flops and obfuscations — they’ve gone out of their way to defend him, acting as though his most recent pronouncements are the only ones that matter, even when he directly contradicts his own previous statements.

Reporters rarely ask him to clarify, elaborate, or otherwise address the myriad questions swirling around his candidacy. Instead, they use prime time interviews to ask him softball questions that would be disappointing for a daytime talk show.

It’s a perfect illustration of the symbiotic relationship between the political and media establishments — the elitists that Trump ran against and defeated four years ago.

“You know Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job,” the President told Biden during their final debate. “If I thought you did a good job, I would’ve never run … I’m looking at you now, you’re a politician, I ran because of you.”

President Trump has a solid point — we elected an anti-establishment candidate for a reason. Donald Trump stood for everything that the Obama-Biden-Clinton cabal despised — he pledged to lower taxes, replace ObamaCare with an approach to health care that actually works, eliminate job-killing regulations, and end the war on American energy.

More importantly, he understood that the American people have a right to know where their president stands on the issues that impact their lives. Biden hasn’t even made it clear that he knows where he stands on most issues.

Amidst the turbulence of this year, the video captivated the country and moved us to tears. Biden’s empathy is exactly what has been missing from the White House these past four years.

In a difficult time where it seems like we can’t escape anxiety and worry — about the health of our loved ones, losing our jobs, racial injustice and social unrest — this reminded us that we need leaders who truly listen and understand, who find mission and purpose in hardship.

JOE BIDEN: I WANT YOUR VOTE TO BECOME YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT — HERE’S WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU AND OUR NATION

In that video that made the rounds last week, Corey Hixon — whose father was the athletic director at the high school when he was shot and killed on Feb. 14, 2018, while trying to save students — runs up to give Biden a hug. The former vice president receives him warmly.

“Are you OK?” Biden asks Corey. Corey says he isn’t. “You’re going to be OK,” Biden tells him. “We’re going to be OK. I promise.”

This is Joe Biden’s message to our country today: we’re going to be OK. He doesn’t try to minimize our collective pain and suffering. He never downplays the deadly coronavirus and its horrific effects on American families, our economy, and our mental health. Instead, he shows us a path forward. In the face of adversity, Biden perseveres.

The video was recorded during the historic March for Our Lives weekend, when my organization brought hundreds of Parkland families to Capitol Hill to make their voices heard in the halls of power. I’ll never forget watching Biden listen to and grieve with those families, and the expression of compassion on his face.

When I think about the video, I also think about courage: the courage it took for Corey to run up to Joe Biden. The courage it took for 13-year-old Brayden Harrington to overcome his stutter, just like Biden overcame his own. The courage and conviction that Joe Biden will bring to the White House every single day.

Joe Biden has never once wavered in his conviction that a better future is possible. As president, he can bring our country to that better future.

Despite my daily struggles, I knew my time in public service wasn’t over — I wanted to help protect all Americans from the tragedy of gun violence. But first I had to relearn how to walk and talk. I had to put one foot in front of the other. I had to master one word and then another.

Joe Biden was there for me during those initial difficult months. When it was time for me to return to the floor of the House of Representatives in August 2011, Vice President Biden came over from the White House to welcome me back. Since then, as I founded and then led an organization dedicated to saving lives from gun violence, Biden has fiercely championed the work we’re doing.

While Democrats focused on their impeachment hoax, President Trump took early action to combat COVID-19. He cut off much of the travel from China, even when Democrats like former Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California opposed it.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the “risk of drug use increases greatly during times of transition.”

This pandemic has imposed limitations on our physical proximity to others, increasing social isolation and loneliness. As a result, many have either turned to substances as an outlet or begun using them again.

ESTIMATES SUGGEST DRUG OVERDOSES ON THE RISE SINCE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK

Preventing drug use starts in the community. To help parents, teachers, law enforcement, and other community leaders prevent young people from initiating drug use and, instead, encourage healthy, drug-free lives, the Trump administration is providing critical funding through ONDCP’s Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program.

Each year, this funding supports around 700 community coalitions across the country focused on preventing drug use among people 18 and younger.

The DFC program has accounted for significant reductions in youth substance use: In communities with a DFC program, among many other benefits, alcohol use among middle school students declined by 25%, and prescription drug use by high school students declined by 26%.

PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS REPORTING DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS TRIPLES DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, STUDY SHOWS

In September, President Trump announced $42.5 million in phase-one funding for the DFC program, and he’ll follow up with another funding announcement to close out Prevention Month.

The results of the DFC program underscore the importance of community-based efforts to prevent youth substance use. In fact, 73% of DFC-funded coalitions identify community involvement as a top protective factor with respect to substance use.

We need to renew our sense of community, regardless of whether it occurs in a safe in-person environment or virtually.

Throughout October, we have highlighted a number of the DFC coalitions and youth leaders across the country for their innovative work to prevent youth substance use and to help their peers #BeDrugFree. These youth leaders provide our nation with hope for a more drug-free future and we are honored to recognize them.

As we commemorate National Substance Abuse Prevention Month, we also honor the courageous women and men in law enforcement who combat the flow of illegal drugs into our communities.

These brave individuals work tirelessly to intercept the narcotics being smuggled into our nation by land, air, and sea.

In fact, under the bold leadership of President Trump, we are taking the fight directly to criminal drug trafficking organizations.

For example, just this month, the DEA executed search warrants that resulted in the seizure of 2,224 pounds of methamphetamine, 893 pounds of cocaine, and 13 pounds of heroin from an affiliate of the Sinaloa Cartel. While, over the past year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations conducted complex criminal investigations into transnational criminal organizations that led to the seizure of over 1.4 million pounds of narcotics.

Additionally, the Coast Guard is relentlessly pursuing narcotraffickers at sea, and Customs and Border Protection is making record-breaking seizures at the border.

We’ve seen firsthand what our officers and agents are capable of, and we assure you that they stand ready to protect the safety and well-being of the American people.

As we have seen during the global pandemic, almost every facet of our lives has needed to adapt.

House GOP Leader McCarthy: I’m voting for President Trump. Here’s why he deserves 4 more years,"Every four years, Americans have the opportunity to choose the leader of the free world and other elected officials, including members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. This year, estimates are that a record number will vote — some casting ballots early and others on Election Day.

The contrast between the two men running for president is crystal clear.

I am voting for President Trump because his record is the difference between four years of results and four decades of rhetoric.

TRUMP JR. WARNS ELECTION IS 'ABOUT FREEDOM VERSUS TYRANNY, CAPITALISM VERSUS SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM'

President Trump took office at a time when wages for the middle class had been stagnant for years, when good-paying jobs and cutting-edge technology had been offshored or stolen by China, and when terrorists in the Middle East controlled territory the size of Great Britain. The so-called experts predicted this decline would be the “new normal.”

But Republicans and President Trump understand that managed decline is unacceptable. Together, our policies reversed it. And despite unprecedented, unending and unfounded attacks on his presidency, he delivered historic results in the economy, national security, energy and the courts.

For three years until the coronavirus pandemic hit, job openings increased, small business closures fell, and wages rose — including for the lowest earners — because Republicans cut taxes, slashed regulations, and renegotiated bad trade deals.

America also achieved energy independence by increasing energy production, and we did it cleanly and safely. In 2019, we generated the largest decline of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in the world, while also becoming the largest oil and gas producer.

We built the greatest economy in a generation and we will do it again. Despite economic troubles singularly caused by the pandemic, the president and Republicans got right to work to get the economy back on solid footing. Through the most aggressive relief package in history, we saved 51 million jobs — and half of the jobs lost have been regained.

We are well on our way to getting the American economy back to where it was just nine months ago.

KEVIN MCCARTHY FUNDRAISING TOPS $103M IN RACE TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE

As for the coronavirus itself, a safe and effective vaccine will be available to Americans in record time because President Trump unleashed the brightest minds in the public and private sectors.

The ISIS physical caliphate has been destroyed. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Iranian terrorist Gen. Qassem Soleimani are dead. And the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan are normalizing relations with Israel.

Other presidents promised to move the American Embassy in Israel to its rightful home in Jerusalem, but only President Trump had the fortitude to do it.

The president’s courageous actions have built confidence in America at home and on the world stage.

President Trump’s reelection is the difference between the most pro-life administration in history and taxpayer-funded abortion on demand. It is the difference between a solid, originalist majority on the Supreme Court that interprets the law as written and a liberal, “living Constitution” majority that would chip away at our rights as citizens.

After four years, the results are clear: America is safer, stronger and more prosperous. Some 56 percent of Americans told Gallup in September that they are better off today than they were four years ago. The coronavirus, the lockdowns, and riots can’t overturn the reality that conservative policies have paved the path to a Great American Comeback.

By contrast, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has been in office for 47 years. He was vice president, a powerful Senate committee chairman, and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination twice before. He accomplished nothing.

When asked about the Gallup poll, Biden said Americans who believe they are better off today should not vote for him because “their memory is not very good.”

If there is a defining aspect of Biden’s career, it’s that he’s been wrong on almost every issue of public importance.

Yet radical Democrats embrace Biden today because they know they can manipulate him to pass an extreme agenda that would dismantle our institutions, “reimagine” capitalism, and divide our nation.

On the bread-and-butter issue of jobs and the economy, Biden’s tax hikes would raise taxes on the middle class. Additionally, his plan to “transition” from fracking and phase out the oil and natural gas industries would eliminate thousands of jobs, raise costs for families, and leave us more dependent on China and other foreign countries for energy.

On constitutional questions, Biden once opposed court packing, but now wants to set up a left-wing commission to change our institutions. He supports the most extreme pro-abortion agenda in history: taxpayer-funded abortions, repealing the Hyde Amendment, and making abortion on demand the law of the land.

And beyond these disastrous policies, Biden has rushed to embrace a toxic left-wing ideology that rejects our founding principles and reduces individuals to their racial identity. “America was an idea,” he says. “We’ve never lived up to it.”

In other words, Biden thinks America is fundamentally and fatally flawed.

But of course, the opposite is true.

America is the freest nation in human history. Our people are creative, kind, and the most generous in the world. No nation is perfect, but America is the only one “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”

If you believe in those sacred principles, the choice in this election could not be clearer. Forward in freedom or backward in socialism. Forward in prosperity or backward in poverty. Forward in personal liberty or backward in government control.

As Republicans, it is our mission to restore our American way of life, rebuild the greatest economy in a generation, and renew the American Dream.

"Sen. Tim Kaine: Joe Biden has my vote. He will restore character, compassion and competence to our nation","I stepped outside my home in Richmond last Saturday to get the morning paper and read the front-page headline—“U.S. Sets One Day Record for Infections.” Versions of the same headline were on the front page of papers across our country. In the tenth month of the global coronavirus crisis, we lead the world in deaths, and cases are surging all across America.

It didn’t have to be this way, as the experience of other nations—Canada, South Korea, Germany—demonstrates. President Trump has flunked the basic test of a president. He hasn’t kept us safe.

My vantage point on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has given me a front-row view into the administration’s mishandling of this crisis.

At our first briefing about the virus in late January, the tension between the administration’s scientists and political spinmeisters was obvious. President Trump viewed this challenge as a threat to his personal political fortune rather than as a threat to the nation’s health. So he sought to minimize it, even to the point of attacking those of us who took it seriously and embraced basic safety steps. And all the while, he’s been pushing his heartless plan to actually take away Americans’ health care in the midst of the pandemic.

SEN. DICK DURBIN: I’M VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN BECAUSE AMERICA NEEDS HIM AS PRESIDENT

By lying about the crisis and refusing to take necessary safety steps, President Trump made it dramatically worse, and many have died unnecessarily as a result. In addition, his strategy of pretending that the virus would soon disappear has caused immense devastation to the U.S. economy, much more damage than that experienced in nations with leaders who took fighting the virus more seriously. The unemployment rate is now 7.9%, 65% greater than when President Trump took office.

I support Joe Biden because he will restore character, compassion, and competence to a nation tired of the death, depression, and division wrought by Donald Trump. And I’ve seen Joe help rescue our country once before.

When the nation’s economy collapsed in the fiscal crisis of 2008, I was governor of Virginia. After Barack Obama and Joe Biden were elected that November, they gathered the nation’s governors at Constitution Hall in Philadelphia and promised that they would consult with us to take the big necessary steps to rebuild the American economy. It wasn’t about Democrat versus Republican. We were all in this together.

I watched the new administration work together with the nation’s governors to put together an economic recovery plan that Congress passed in February 2009. President Obama asked Joe Biden to lead the effort of implementing the plan nationwide. And he did it successfully, patiently working with all of us to usher in the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.

Here’s what I learned about Joe during that tough chapter. His heart is in the right place, and he knows good government. But he also knows he doesn’t have all the answers. So he pulled us together, made a plan, implemented it, and stuck with it until it succeeded. He didn’t lie. He didn’t divide. He didn’t attack people. He didn’t grow bored with the effort. He didn’t surrender. He did what it took to help America climb out of the deep hole we were in.

We need that kind of leadership now. A Biden-Harris administration will implement the plan that Joe has carefully laid out to defeat COVID—not give up and pretend that a rising death toll is acceptable. A Biden-Harris administration will build a ladder for American families and businesses so we can climb out of the economic crisis we are in.

And a Biden-Harris administration will never forget that it’s not about them. It’s about you. It’s about all of us. Let’s reunite for the success that America deserves with Joe Biden as our next president.",,
"Jefferson Starship’s David Freiberg, Cathy Richardson share memories of Paul Kantner: ‘He brings us together'","For Jefferson Starship, it’s about time.

The ‘70s rock group has recently released a new album titled “Mother of the Sun,” which is their first release in 12 years. It features a new single titled “It’s About Time,” co-written by former original member Grace Slick, 80.

Even during an ongoing pandemic, Jefferson Starship is just as passionate about creating new music that pays tribute to founding member Paul Kantner. The artist passed away in 2016 at age 74 from organ failure and septic shock.

Fox News spoke to Jefferson Starship members David Freiberg and Cathy Richardson about their newest single, honoring Kantner’s memory and whether they’re afraid to get political in 2020.

QUEEN, DAVID BOWIE'S 'UNDER PRESSURE' COVERED BY WILLIE NELSON, KAREN O

Fox News: What do you believe has been the secret behind Jefferson Starship’s lasting success?

David Freiberg: I think it comes down to the songs and the chemistry the band has. Also, not being afraid to add or subtract people. When we started out, Jefferson Starship was really everybody that was left out of Jefferson Airplane.

But the band kept evolving, both musically and with its members. The music and the crew kept changing with the times and adapting somehow. We were always moving with this spark of a new song or idea.

Cathy Richardson: We’ve just grown to be really tight as a band during all the years being on the road. In the last couple of years of Paul’s life, he was not doing well. So we were going out without him.

And it was always this volatile situation because we didn’t know if the promoters were going to be mad because Paul’s not here. Are the fans going to be mad? But we got through that. We became tight emotionally and musically. When Paul passed away, we felt this would be an amazing tribute to him, to continue making music and dedicating it to him. He brings us together.

EDDIE VAN HALEN’S CALIFORNIA HOMETOWN PLANS MEMORIAL FOR LATE ROCK LEGEND

Fox News: What’s one memory of Paul Kantner that has been resonating with you lately?

Freiberg: Oh, Paul has been my good friend since 1962 so there are many. He had this way of being in control, and yet had no problem with letting anybody do whatever they wanted unless he noticed something and then he would call your attention to it. But that happened very rarely. He was just an amazing man with so many amazing ideas. And so well-read. His songs had lots of intellect. You can still discover something new in them today.

Richardson: I remember one night we were in Anchorage, Alaska playing in this beautiful theater. We were singing this beautiful song and I just had this moment where I felt I needed to remember every single second of it because it was that awesome. The way that our voices were harmonizing in this beautiful venue surrounded by friends - you couldn’t ask for anything more. I think that perfectly captures my memory of Paul and how wonderful he was.

He was very smart but also very funny with this dry sense of humor. We would laugh all the time. All it would take was for him to drop this subtle line and we would be rolling on the floor laughing. He wasn’t an out there personality. He was very reserved, very shy. He stayed to himself a lot. But when he came out, it was all rock ’n’ roll.

Fox News: What’s the story behind “Jane.” is there a real Jane Doe?

Freiberg: Oh, I don’t want to blow her identity *laughs*. We changed her name to protect her identity, you know. She was an old girlfriend of mine actually who was there right at the beginning of when Quicksilver Messenger Service started, my first band.

OZZY OSBOURNE SAYS VAN HALEN ASKED HIM TO BE A MEMBER OF THE BAND

It’s about things that we went through that were amplified. Once you start writing a song, the characters develop their own lives. Perhaps they were a little better than the truth. [But] I know her today and she’s a very fine person. One of the best that I know.

Fox News: The first single from “Mother of the Sun” was co-written by Grace Slick. Can you tell us about that?

Richardson: Yes, I was staying at her house in Malibu and we were watching the Women’s March. We were just really excited to see the activism and seeing women marching for their rights. And I said, “We should write a song that encapsulates this movement. It’s about time for women to rule the world, you know?” She said, “That sounds really cool.” And then one day in the mail, I received these handwritten lyrics from her.

She wrote a note and said, “It’s probably too much, but take what you see fits and throw away the rest.” I immediately grabbed my guitar and wrote a chorus. And then Jude [Gold] had this riff he was playing around with during soundcheck. And that’s how the song “It’s About Time” was born. I think we ended up with a really great song.

Fox News: Cathy, you were handpicked by Grace to serve as vocalist for Jefferson Starship. What was your initial impression of her?

Richardson: Actually, I was originally hired by Paul Kantner in 2008. He was alive and very much actively touring then. So when I joined, I didn’t know her yet. I eventually met her at one of her art shows and I just immediately felt she was super cool. I quickly had all these questions for her.

STEVIE NICKS SAYS 'TIME IS BEING STOLEN FROM' ARTISTS WAITING TO PERFORM LIVE AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

It was just an incredible honor. But she has been incredibly supportive of this journey and I couldn’t be more thankful.

Fox News: With the ongoing pandemic, it can be very discouraging for some bands to release new music. What’s keeping Jefferson Starship going?

Richardson: I don’t think any of us can do anything else *laughs*. When you’re a performer, it’s your lifeblood. We can’t wait to get back out.

That’s what keeps us going, the hope. And having an album out during a pandemic has been really great for us. Otherwise, we’d be really sitting around and doing nothing *laughs*. Even though we’re at home, we get to connect with fans and release new music.

Fox News: What’s one thing about the music being released during the ‘60s and ‘70s you miss the most, something we don’t necessarily have today in 2020?

Richardson: Although pop music is really great, I miss seeing the bands going up on stage, rocking out and just sounding amazing without all the backing tracks, dancers and explosions.

QUEEN GUITARIST BRIAN MAY HAS ‘THEORY’ THAT CORONAVIRUS CAUSED HIS HEART ATTACK DESPITE TESTING NEGATIVE

I mean, explosions are great. Dancing is great. All that stuff is great. But a band just playing music is great too. That’s what I miss the most. And that’s what we do. And I miss it so much that I’m going to do it for the rest of my life.

Fox News: What’s the most unique encounter you’ve ever had with a fan?

Richardson: Well, David gets recognized everywhere 'cause he’s got that cotton ball hair that’s unmistakable *laughs*. A lot of time we’ll get off an airplane and you’ll see a guy there holding a stack full of albums and he makes David sign like 30 of them. And David, being as sweet as he is, signs all of them. But you know these albums are going straight to eBay for a ridiculous price and not for a genuine fan. So that can be annoying.

Fox News: In a year of political unrest, some artists don’t think twice about sharing their views. Others prefer to stay quiet out of fear that it may alienate some of their fans. What’s your stance, especially this year?

Richardson: We’re very vocal and we’re letting it out. We’re saying what we think because it’s too important not to. When we go out into the world and are on tour, we play in every part of the country. We play in small towns and we meet people from all walks of life. But we know that probably a lot of them don’t have the same political views as we do.

What we try to do with music is to bring people together. Music is the great unifier, the universal language. It makes you feel something, it makes you connected to something. So in a way, we can all come together and agree on something, you know?

So it makes me sad if people don’t want to hear our music if they don’t agree with our political views. We do want to come together. We want to work towards a world that is good for everybody. Not just some people.

DAVID BOWIE WAS ‘A CHEERFUL SOUL,’ PHOTOGRAPHER SAYS: ‘HE CAME TO PLAY’

We’re all trying to make it through each day. And I think we all want to live in peace. We all want to be prosperous. We all want to be happy. We all want the best for our children. No matter what our political views are, no matter what our racial makeup is, no matter if we’re gay or straight - that’s our message. And I really hope our country starts to heal soon.",,
John Lydon defends Trump's attacks on mainstream press: 'More power to him',"John Lydon knows a thing or two about cancel culture.

In March 1977, when he went by the name Johnny Rotten as lead singer of the Sex Pistols, the band’s record company EMI not only ripped up the Pistols’ record contract six days after they signed it, the label also destroyed all 25,000 copies of their first single, “God Save the Queen,” a sendup of the royal family released to coincide with Queen Elizabeth II’s Silver Jubilee.

To add insult to injury, the song was also banned from radio, but “God Save the Queen” (now released by Richard Branson's Virgin Records) kept flying off the shelves anyway, and the record made it all the way to No. 2 on Billboard’s British charts. You wouldn’t have known that from looking at those charts, however, as the banned song was represented instead by a blank space, right below Rod Stewart's ""The First Cut Is the Deepest.""

But wait, there's more!

A few months later, when the band's first full-length album ""Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols"" was displayed in a store window, the band was charged with indecency based on the album's title, with authorities citing an obscure law passed in 1889. (The Sex Pistols won.)

“Actually, it was fantastic,” Lydon recently told Fox News in a FaceTime interview from his home in Venice, Calif., which was built by another legendary provocateur, Mae West. “It proved that I was on the right track and I was actually achieving something here. That's power to the people. That's how we win.”

So began Lydon’s lifelong dance with power, politics, and controversy. First with the Sex Pistols, and then with his post-punk band Public Image Limited (PiL), Lydon’s career and persona have been synonymous with questioning authority -- any authority.

Once you once you go down that current Democratic Party way, there's no return from that — John Lydon

“I like to debate. I like to discuss it. And I like to consider very different points of view,” Lydon said, “All of my friends are very varied in this respect, and I want it that way. I want healthy discourse in everything, because how on earth am I ever going to learn?”

That fascination with competing viewpoints is on display in Lydon’s music (13 studio albums and counting), as well as his new book, “I Could Be Wrong, I Could Be Right,” (A Way With Media, 2020) whose title comes from a lyric in Public Image Limited’s best-known song, “Rise.”

“You have to tell it honestly and share those experiences and indeed endure the criticisms, because it is like you put your head on the chopping block each time you declare a needed truth about yourself,” Lydon said. “The gift of sharing comes with consequences.”

[Trump] broke that system, that Washington criminality that's caused the problems for all of us in the first place — John Lydon

Lydon has been experiencing some of those consequences recently with his criticism of some parts of the Black Lives Matter movement and his embrace of President Donald Trump. Lydon has been a U.S. citizen since 2013, when he supported a very different candidate.

“I became an American citizen because I believed that Obama could change the world for a better place and I truly believed that at the time,” Lydon explained. “I was very disappointed in eight years how little was actually achieved.”

Since switching his allegiances, Lydon has suffered his share of slings and arrows. While some fans see his embrace of the Republican president as a continuation of his punk-rock, shock-and-awe ways, many -- on social media at least -- are disappointed, calling Lydon among other things “about as punk as a game of golf,” “sadly irrelevant,” and “the bougie punk Rotten turned into.”

Lydon says he is used to it, and is sticking to his guns.

“I think that the rule books must be thrown out. Once you go down that current Democratic Party way, there's no return from that,"" Lydon said. ""It's slowly but surely rule after rule after rule that will stifle the living daylights out of you.""

In Trump, Lydon sees an alternative to that route.

“I met him once. I know, what an offensive fella. But he went into politics as the complete individual. That's what we want,” Lydon explained. “I don't like politicians really, generally speaking, not many of them at all. I don't trust of them. He broke that system, that Washington criminality that's caused the problems for all of us in the first place.”

JOHN LYDON: TRUMP IS 'THE ONLY SENSIBLE CHOICE'

Lydon also sees Trump’s battles with the mainstream press as much the press' fault as it is his.

“I mean, from day one, I remember like CNN were b---hing about Donald Trump’s tie length. ‘Oh, look at that length, that's obviously indicating something,’” Lydon quipped. “It's not an issue. Then as time went by the criticisms became more and more personal. And I have to say, of course, his responses are personal, because he's being attacked daily on a personal level. More power to him.”

If I don't adapt and I stay rigid to one particular philosophy, then I'm nothing more than an idiot — John Lydon

Lydon also sees a fellow traveler in the combative leader of the free world beset by bad headlines.

“I feel for him in that respect because I've enjoyed the same hate, the same misunderstanding. You know, we go back to early punk -- Pistols, PiL, everything I've done in my life. I know what it's like to stand up for what you think is right and to have to endure that that continuous barrage of self-righteous, smug, pompous, condescending, ‘We know better’ nonsense. I know what that's like.”

Lydon feels the same way about his dealings with the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. He has several screen credits, including a co-starring role with Harvey Keitel in 1983’s “Order of Death.”

“Hollywood's never done me any favors. They've always found me very difficult to cope with, that particular Democrat clique,” Lydon said of his love-hate relationship with showbiz. “I've been to their parties, their fundraisers years ago and they just they will not be questioned on anything at all. The presumption of the moral high ground is so defaming of truth.”

A combination of the coronavirus crisis and caring for his wife Nora Forster, who has Alzheimer’s, has kept Lydon off the road and out of the studio in recent months, and he says that has given him even more time to think about America’s widening divide.

“The issues make me have to adapt. If I don't adapt and I stay rigid to one particular philosophy, then I'm nothing more than an idiot,” he said. “And that's the problem with being all or nothing, and that's the great divide we're now facing at the moment, the idiocy of it all to the left, all to the right.”

JOHN LYDON ON CARING FOR HIS WIFE: 'THE REAL PERSON IS STILL THERE'

His extended time at home has also given Lydon, 64, the opportunity to finally shepherd his 2017 PiL documentary “The Public Image Is Rotten” across all major digital streaming services just this week, and to write and produce ""I Could Be Wrong, I Could Be Right,"" a limited edition, hand-signed and cased hardbound coffee-table creation filled with opinions, life lessons, and stories from his youth.

“I love books,” he said. “They’re the very thing that helped me in my youth to recover from a serious illness where I lost all my memories. And so forever since, I worship libraries and worship books, and I treat them at the same respect I do as music.”

Who doesn't love a woman that dismisses them. Oh, come on, fellas! They become instantly intriguing — John Lydon

Lydon contracted viral meningitis as a child and spent a year in the hospital, much of it in a coma. He has credited that health scare with everything from his distinctive singing voice to his “Rotten stare.” He also said that his illness, combined with caring for his ailing mother and younger siblings in his own youth, gave him a capacity for caring and empathy that has served him well with his wife, who has suffered with her progressive disease for several years.

“It's just my natural way. And those are the gifts that God gives you. I like helping. I hate taking help because I think it takes away the personal freedoms,"" he said. ""But at the same time, there are so many people that do need your attention, so give it to them willingly.”

And now, that attention is going to his wife, whom he met in his Sex Pistols days when the then-promoter took him down a notch about an outfit he was wearing.

""Who doesn't love a woman that dismisses them. Oh, come on, fellas! They become instantly intriguing,"" Lydon marveled. ""And that's that's the fascination and the adoration I have for us as a species. We love our differences. It's what makes us better. If two people that have a similar mindset ever tried to form a relationship, that's one tuned to boredom. Come on, this is life, not rhetoric.""",,
Kendall Jenner blasted for star-studded Halloween birthday party amid coronavirus pandemic: ‘Eat the rich’,"Kendall Jenner threw herself a massive Halloween party for her birthday on Saturday night.

The model reportedly invited 100 people despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Jenner’s party at Harriet’s Rooftop in Los Angeles comes just days after her sister Kim Kardashian was slammed for her lavish 40th birthday with 20-25 attendees on a private island.

Many people on social media weren’t happy when photos showed maskless guests and no social distancing at Jenner’s party.

“@MayorOfLA can you fine all these celebrities already?! they are NOT above the law. How are you giving fines to nobody TikTokers but won’t do the same for the most known celebrities?” one person tweeted.

Another similarly wrote: “This! And why is she allowed to have a party, when here in CA kids aren’t allowed to trick or treat because of Covid?? @GavinNewsom will @KendallJenner be fined for violating COVID guidelines? That’s a large gathering.”

One person commented, “not all these celebs posting about wearing a mask, social distancing then showing up to kendall jenners party. eat the rich.”

Others criticized the model for a video showing her blowing out birthday candles as a waiter appears to flinch backward.

“Ok Kendall Jenner blowing out candles as a masked waiter holds her cake and tries to move out of the way was actually the scariest thing I saw on Halloween,” one person said.

“not jaden smith dressing up as a covid patient for halloween. apart from attending that kendall jenner party, he's making fun of the situation. my mom and my aunt are ashmatic, and they were rushed to the hospital with oxygen many times. i'm beyond disgusted,” one person tweeted.

Another said, “There’s just something so inhumane about Jaden Smith wearing an oxygen mask as a costume.”

AP Top 25: No. 2 Alabama closes gap with Clemson; Liberty in,"Clemson remained No. 1 in The Associated Press college football poll on Sunday, but not by much.

Trevor Lawrence's absence because of COVID-19 and the Tigers' narrow win over Boston College created a divide among the 62 writers and broadcasters on the voting panel.

Clemson received 33 first-place votes — 19 fewer than last week — and has only a two-point lead over No. 2 Alabama heading into a huge ACC matchup at fourth-ranked Notre Dame this week.

Alabama, which handed Mike Leach his first shutout as a head coach with a 41-0 victory over Mississippi State, got the other 29 first-place votes.

The rest of the top five remained the same, with Ohio State at No. 3, followed by Notre Dame and Georgia.

The unbeaten Liberty Flames, in their third year in the Football Bowl Subdivision, entered the rankings for the first time at No. 25. Penn State is out for the first time since 2016 following consecutive losses.

Voters had differing opinions on how to handle Clemson. Six voters who had Alabama No. 1 on their ballots had Clemson third behind Ohio State.

Lawrence was ruled out of the game against Boston College after testing positive for COVID-19, and coach Dabo Swinney announced that his Heisman Trophy front-runner wouldn't play against Notre Dame either.

Clemson made up an 18-point deficit in the second half to beat BC 34-28. Five-star freshman D.J. Uiagalelei made his first start and got better as the game went on as Clemson pulled off its largest comeback for a home win in program history.

Alabama made easy work of Mississippi State and has now scored 35 or more points in 19 straight games, the longest streak in the FBS.

POLL POINTS

Liberty, which was idle Saturday, beat out Northwestern for the No. 25 spot. Hugh Freeze's Flames are 6-0 against mostly light competition. Their biggest test so far comes this week at Virginia Tech.

The last time Penn State was unranked was Oct. 16, 2016. The next week the Nittany Lions upset Ohio State in Happy Valley and appeared in 63 straight polls in which they were eligible. (Big Ten teams were removed from consideration for two polls this year because of their coronavirus-delayed season.)

Penn State had the fourth-longest active streak behind Alabama (205), Ohio State (138) and Clemson (94).

Cincinnati, at No. 6, has its highest ranking since it finished the 2009 regular season No. 4.

No. 9 BYU is in the top 10 for the first time since it was No. 7 on Sept. 13, 2009.

No. 13 Indiana has its best ranking since it was as high as No. 11 in 1987.

"Springer, LeMahieu, Realmuto among 6 given qualifying offers","Houston outfielder George Springer, New York Yankees second baseman DJ LeMahieu and Philadelphia catcher J.T. Realmuto were among just six free agents who received $18.9 million qualifying offers on Sunday from their former teams.

Three right-handed pitchers also received the offers, Cincinnati’s Trevor Bauer, the New York Mets’ Marcus Stroman and San Francisco's Kevin Gausman.

Those six players have until 5 p.m. on Nov. 11 to accept the offers or press ahead as free agents, who could start negotiating contracts with all teams on Sunday night.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

They are the only ones subject to compensation among the 181 players who became free agents in a market that also includes pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, outfielder Marcell Ozuna, shortstop Didi Gregorius and designated hitter Nelson Cruz.

A brutal market is expected, with many teams likely to cut payrolls following a regular season played with no fans in the seats due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

If a team makes a qualifying offer to a player who signs a major league contract with another club before the June amateur draft, his former club would receive a draft pick as compensation at the end of the first round or at the end of competitive balance round B. The placement depends on whether the new contract is worth $50 million or more and the revenue-sharing and luxury tax status of the team losing the player.

A free agent could be made a qualifying offer only if he had been with the same team continuously since opening day and had never received a qualifying offer before.

Qualifying offers began after the 2012 season, and only five of 90 offers have been accepted: New York Mets second baseman Neil Walker and Philadelphia pitcher Jeremy Hellickson after the 2016 season; Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu after the 2018 season and Chicago White Sox first baseman José Abreu last season. Abreu later agreed to a $50 million, three-year contract.

The qualifying offer price started at $13.3 million in 2012 and rose to $14.1 million in 2013, $15.3 million in 2014, $15.8 million in 2015, $17.2 million in 2016 and $17.4 million in 2017.

New York Yankees designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton and Boston DH J.D. Martinez kept their contracts rather than go free and test the market following subpar seasons.

Stanton is owed $218 million for seven seasons and Martinez $38.75 million for two years.

Stanton, who turns 31 on Nov. 8, hit .266 with 38 homers and 100 RBIs in his first season with the Yankees in 2018. He batted .288 with three homers and 13 RBIs in 2019, when he was limited to 18 games by a left biceps strain that sidelined him from April 1 to June 18 and a right knee strain that kept him out from June 26 to Sept. 18.

Stanton hit .250 with four homers and 11 RBIs in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, limited to 23 games by a left hamstring strain that sidelined him from Aug. 9 to Sept. 15. He rebounded to become the Yankees’ best offensive player in the playoffs, hitting .308 (8 for 26) with six homers and 13 RBIs in seven games.

Martinez gets $19,375,000 in each of the next two seasons and can opt out after 2021.

Martinez hit a career-low .213 in the pandemic-shortened season with seven homers and 27 RBIs, his lowest output since 2013. His salary was cut from $23.75 million to a prorated $8,796,296.

Boston declined a $6.85 million option on left-hander Martín Pérez and opted to pay a $500,000 buyout to the 29-year-old, who became a free agent. Perez was 3-5 with a 4.50 ERA in 12 starts, striking out 46 and walking 28 in 62 innings in his first season with Boston after leaving Minnesota as a free agent. He had a $6 million salary, reduced to $2,222,222 in prorated pay.

Reliever Dellin Betances exercised his $6 million player option with the Mets, deciding against taking a $3 million buyout and becoming a free agent. A 6-foot-8 right-hander who turns 33 on March 23, Betances signed with the Mets last December for a deal that guaranteed $10.5 million. A four-time All-Star during seven seasons with the New York Yankees, Betances slumped to a 7.71 ERA in 15 relief appearances with the Mets, walking 12 and striking out 11 in 11 2/3 innings.

Earlier, Mets reliever Brad Brach exercised his $2,075,000 player option for next season.

Arizona exercised a $4.25 million option on pitcher Merrill Kelly rather than pay a $500,000 buyout, and Baltiore exercised a $3.5 million option on shortstop José Iglesias rather than pay a $500,000 buyout.

Houston exercised an option on left-hander Brooks Raley calling for a $2 million salary in the major leagues and a $250,000 salary in the minors, and San Diego declined a $3 million option on first baseman Mitch Moreland, which calls for a $500,000 buyout.

Raley was 0-1 with a 3.94 ERA and one save in 17 relief appearances and pitched scoreless relief in five of six playoff appearances. He entered with a tie score in Game 3 of the Division Series against Oakland and allowed a pair of sacrifice flies in a 9-7 loss.

Moreland hit .203 with two homers and eight RBIs in 69 at-bats for San Diego, which acquired him from Boston on Aug. 30, and was 4 for 8 with an RBI in the playoffs. He batted .328 with eight homers and 21 RBIs for the Red Sox, and had $925,926 in prorated pay from a $2.5 million salary.",,
"Lester, Kluber, Hand boost free agent total to 175","Jon Lester, Corey Kluber and Brad Hand were among 15 more major leaguers who became free agents Friday when teams declined their 2021 options, many the victims of budget cuts following a regular season without fans due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Also cut loose were Milwaukee infielders Jedd Gyorko and Eric Sogard, Chicago White Sox designated hitter Edwin Encarnación and left-hander Gio González, and Philadelphia relievers David Robertson, Héctor Neris and David Phelps.

AL champion Tampa Bay declined 2021 options on right-hander Charlie Morton and catcher Mike Zunino but say it remains hopeful of re-signing them.

There are 175 players who became free agents following the World Series and about 15 more can go free this weekend. Among the remaining decisions are on player options by Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton, Boston designated hitter JD Martinez, Cincinnati outfielder Nick Castellanos and Mets reliever Dellin Betances.

Teams must decide by 5 p.m. Sunday whether to make $18.9 million qualifying offers to eligible former players who went free.

Lester gets a $10 million buyout from the Chicago Cubs that completes a $155 million, six-year contract rather than a $25 million mutual option. The 36-year-old left-hander was 3-3 with a 5.16 ERA in 12 starts this year with 42 strikeouts and 17 walks. He earned a prorated $5,555,556 from his scheduled $15 million salary.

He was 77-44 with a 3.64 ERA in 171 starts over six seasons with the Cubs, in 2016 helping them win the first World Series in 108 years. He was 3-3 with a 2.44 ERA and .201 opponents’ batting average in the postseason.

Milwaukee turned down Gyorko and Sogard, a day after declining a $15 million option on 2011 NL MVP Ryan Braun.

Gyorko and Sogard each had $4.5 million options. Gyorko gets a $1 million buyout and Sogard $500,000.

The 32-year-old Gyorko hit .248 with nine homers and 17 RBIs in 42 games and 135 at-bats. Sogard, who turns 35 on May 22, hit .209 with one homer, 10 RBIs and a .560 OPS in 43 games.

“I think there’s a recognition that flexibility is important right now, and we don’t know what the next couple of months are going to look like,” general manager David Stearns said. “We don’t know what the environment is going to be as we do plan for a spring training in the 2021 season. So we have to remain flexible. And that desire for flexibility has likely contributed to some of the decisions we’ve seen throughout the industry over the last couple of days.”

Cleveland declined Hand’s $10 million option and also turned down first baseman Carlos Santana ($17.5 million). The Indians did exercise a $5.5 million option for catcher Roberto Pérez. Cleveland owes buyouts of $1 million to Hand and $500,000 to Carlos Santana.

“With Brad it was a really difficult decision,” Indians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said. “He’s been such a critical part of our team for the last few seasons. He did an extraordinary job in his role as a closer and also was a leader in the clubhouse, specifically within the bullpen group.

“In the end, we did take some time to explore the trade market for Brad and weren’t able to find a fit for him. Again, a very difficult decision.”

Antonetti had pointed toward the moves and a substantial cut in payroll earlier this month due to the team’s financial hit caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There could be other, bigger moves as the Indians consider trading All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor before his final season under contract.

“It’s very early to tell and I’m not sure it makes a whole lot of sense to forecast things,” Antonetti said. “What we’ve been focused on are the decisions we have in front of us and engaging with teams to help inform those decisions.”

Hand went 2-1 with a 2.06 ERA and went 16 for 16 in save chances in the 60-game season.

Santana struggled in his second season back in Cleveland after leaving as a free agent in 2018. The switch-hitter batted a career-low .199 with eight homers and 30 RBIs in 60 games. Antonetti said it’s possible the club could re-sign the 34-year-old Santana, who has spent 10 seasons with the Indians.

The White Sox declined a $12 million option for Encarnación and a $7 million option for González, who will receive a $500,000. Chicago exercised a $3.5 million option on utilityman Leury García.

Toronto exercised a $1.5 million option on reliever Rafael Dolis and declined a $9.5 million option on right-hander Chase Anderson, who gets a $500,000 buyout. The 32-year-old Anderson was 1-2 with a 7.22 ERA in seven starts and three relief appearances last season.

Kluber, whose option was for $18 million, lasted just one inning in his only start in the third game of the season before a shoulder injury ended his year.

Kluber gets a $1 million buyout, and the club has said it is interested in re-signing Kluber to a less expensive deal. The Rangers acquired the two-time Cy Young Award winner from Cleveland last offseason in a trade that sent hard-throwing reliever Emmanuel Clase to the Indians.

Morton, who turns 37 next month, was due to earn $15 million. Zunino’s option was for $4.5 million. Both played keys roles in the Rays reaching the World Series, where Tampa Bay lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.

Morton was 3-1 with a 2.70 ERA this postseason, losing Game 3 of the World Series. He was 2-2 with a 4.74 ERA during the season.

“We’re going to continue talking,” general manager Erik Neander said. “Charlie’s been very open about the uncertainty in his future and where he’s at. Frankly, I felt it was best to let him catch his breath, let him process, let him make some decisions with his family and have those conversations to give us a little more time. I would love nothing more than to have Charlie back as part of our club next year.”",,
Coronavirus pandemic 'was nothing' to potential No. 1 NBA draft pick,"Anthony Edwards could be the No. 1 pick when the NBA Draft begins next month.

Edwards, a standout from Georgia, had his pro day Thursday night. He appeared on ESPN’s “Sportscenter” and was asked how he handled working out since the college basketball season abruptly ended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“I feel like the pandemic was nothing to me,” Edwards told anchor John Buccigross. “I was already living in a pandemic because all I wanted to do was get better. I’m an in-home kid so all I want to do is get better, play with my dogs and play the game all day. That’s all I want to do.”

The Minnesota Timberwolves, Golden State Warriors and Charlotte Hornets each have the top three picks in the draft, and any one of the teams could get Edwards. But the guard isn’t expected to fall below No. 3.

Edwards’ workout was hosted by Klutch Sports – the same agency that reps Los Angeles Lakers stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

“It’s a dream come true. I feel like if I get picked first overall I got bragging rights and I just can’t stop there. I got to prove myself. I got to prove that I should be the No. 1 pick. I gotta prove that if they pick me, I belong out here and I’m [gonna] stay,” he said.

NHL legend Bobby Orr on supporting Trump: 'That’s the kind of teammate I want',"Legendary NHL player Bobby Orr took out an ad in the New Hampshire Union-Leader on Friday expressing his support for President Trump’s reelection campaign.

Orr urged those who were still undecided heading into the Nov. 3 Election Day to vote for Trump.

NFL GREAT BRETT FAVRE THROWS HIS SUPPORT TOWARD TRUMP

“Everyone has an opinion as our upcoming Presidential election approaches, and I am no different. When I look at American during these turbulent times, I keep trying to separate style from substance, fact from fiction. This much I know. Our current President has had to operate under extremely difficult conditions over these past several years. In addition, no leader anywhere signed up with the idea that dealing with a worldwide pandemic would be a part of their mandate. The attacks on our president have been unrelenting since the day he took office. Despite that, President Trump has delivered for all the American people regardless of race, gender of station in life,” Orr’s message read.

“That’s the kind of teammate I want.”

The Hockey Hall of Famer and two-time Stanley Cup champion urged New Hampshire residents to look past his tweets and look at his policies.

GOLF LEGEND JACK NICKLAUS ENDORSES TRUMP

“Perhaps you do not like his tweets or how the President says things sometimes, and that is your right. But remember, this is not a personality contested; it’s about policies and the people those policies assist,” he wrote, adding that he was concerned for the U.S.

“Some of you may still be undecided at this point. Your vote for President Trump would help keep America moving forward in the years ahead,” he continued.

The paragraphs were accompanied by a photo of Orr, his wife Peggy and the president.

New Hampshire has historically been a key battleground state in presidential elections. It is worth four electoral votes.

Trump lost the state to Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a mere 2,736 votes. Barack Obama carried the state in 2012 and 2008 and John Kerry won it in 2000. George W. Bush won the state in 2000 and Bill Clinton had won it during his two presidential election victories.

Interim tag off Bowness month after Stars play in Cup final,"The Dallas Stars have officially removed the interim tag from Rick Bowness, the coach who led them to the Stanley Cup Final.

General manager Jim Nill made the long-anticipated announcement Thursday, a month after the extended and most unusual season came to a close. The 65-year-old Bowness is the Stars' 24th head coach, their ninth since moving to Dallas in 1993.

Bowness was 20-13-5 after becoming their interim head coach in December. He was in his second season as a Stars assistant for Jim Montgomery, who was fired and later went to alcohol rehabilitation.

“My wife Judy and I are thrilled to have this opportunity to continue our work here in Dallas,” Bowness said. “This team is very special for me, that time in Edmonton was unlike any experience I have ever had in hockey, and it brought us together as a staff and as a team.""

There were no immediate details about Bowness' contract.

The Stars made it to their first Stanley Cup Final since 2000. After going winless in their final six games before the coronavirus pandemic halted the season in mid-March, the Stars went to the NHL bubble in Edmonton to finish the season. They won the Western Conference before falling to Tampa Bay in six games.

“After being called upon in a difficult situation, Rick stepped into the interim head coaching role seamlessly and used his unmatched experience to lead the team to a successful second half of the season and a spot in the Stanley Cup Final,"" Nill said. ""Watching the team throughout our playoff experience, you really saw the team become his. His ability to connect with our players and our staff is remarkable, and it leads to a situation where everyone is competing for him because they want to see him win.”

The only NHL coaches other than Bowness to be a head coach in parts of five different decades are Hall of Fame members Pat Quinn and Scotty Bowman.

Bowness was the head coach previously in Winnipeg (1988-89), Boston (1991-92), Ottawa (1992-96), the New York Islanders (1996-98) and Phoenix (2003-04). He was also a long-time assistant, and was on Tampa Bay's staff in 2015 when the Lightning lost in the Stanley Cup Final before joining the Stars.",,

Duke's Mike Krzyzewski on NCAA's maximum games limit: 'It's crazy',"Duke men’s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski said Wednesday that the NCAA’s cap on the number of games presents some challenges for the upcoming 2020-21 season.

Krzyzewski made his opinion known during a conference call with reporters, according to ESPN. The NCAA said initially that teams could reach the maximum 27-game number by entering a multi-team event (MTE) but last week the NCAA said a team could reach the number with two MTEs.

MORE THAN 30 COLLEGE TEAMS TO PLAY EARLY GAMES AT CASINO

“In cutting down from 31 [games] to 27 [games], it should have been where you just give 27 games,” the legendary Duke coach said. “We didn't do that, so then people tried to form their own MTEs, get into different things and now, you can get into two MTEs. You're trying to figure out games. I just think the planning in that regard was not very good. Once you cut down from 31 to 27, you should've just given everyone an opportunity to schedule and not worry about the MTEs. We actually have formed our own because we had to. It's crazy. It could've been easy to just say 'Everyone's got 27, let's go.’”

Krzyzewski added that the onus is on the conferences, and not the NCAA, to have a successful season.

VILLANOVA THE BIG EAST PICK AS LEAGUE WARILY WATCHES VIRUS

“There is no regular season,” he said. “From the very start, this was not looked at as a time that we are in a pandemic and there is not going to be a regular season, not like what we've had. The NCAA got a starting date and they got an end date. Nothing against them. That's the main thing they're concerned about, then it really goes to the conferences to figure it all out. ... We're going to have March Madness. We don't know how teams will get in. We don't know a lot of things but we know we're going to have a regular season. We just don't know much about both. That's a helluva way to run a railroad.”

Villanova the Big East pick as league warily watches virus,"Jay Wright and his fellow Big East coaches know it will take a huge effort from everyone to make the college basketball season work this year and actually stage an NCAA Tournament.

Only a few weeks into the start of practice, there already have been some bumps due to the coronavirus. Many more are expected.

Big East coaches got on Zoom calls Wednesday for their annual media day and — while still talking about basketball and the return of UConn — outlined a stark reality facing all of college basketball this season: Coronavirus testing, COVID-19 protocols and the lack of confirmed schedules are dominant features of preparing to play.

“This year, as we’ve all learned, anything can happen,"" said Wright, whose Villanova team was the coaches' pick to win the league. ""We’ve been shut down and we all learn is, it’s not 14 days. It’s guys get shut down in different increments. Then (they) have to get heart tests and it could affect your team for 21,23 days. That’s just part of it. How do you handle all the challenges? There are more than any season in the history of college basketball.”

The Big East announced that its Gavitt Tip-Off games, the annual challenge with the Big Ten, has been postponed a year. They are still trying to have matchups against the Big 12.

Dozens of preseason tournament games have already been canceled and a few teams have had to push the pause button because of positive COVID-19 tests.

Marquette has already had a setback, having to quarantine for two weeks because of a positive test and can't get back on the court until Nov. 4. Creighton coach Greg McDermott said while it is normally a coaching cliche to say teams are taking it day by day, it is more fitting this season than any other.

“When practice is over we talk about the things that allowed us to practice today, wearing masks, practice social distancing, make sure you’re not in a group setting, protect yourself and teammates,"" he said. ""The message has been: assume the person you’re talking to has COVID. What steps are you taking to protect yourself?”

Commissioner Val Ackerman said the league will follow NCAA guidelines and teams will be testing three times a week leading up to play.

“We will do our best where disruptions are kept to a minimum and a number of Big East schools are able to compete for a national championship next spring,” Ackerman said.

Wright's team is the preseason pick to win the conference for the sixth time in seven years, receiving nine of the 11 first-place votes from league coaches.

“I hope we live out the predictions,” Wright said. “As we all know, we got a lot of work to do.”

HONORING BIG JOHN

The Big East will establish an award named for former Georgetown coach John Thompson that will recognize his efforts to fight prejudice, discrimination and advance positive social change. The award will be given annually to an individual, team or athletic department. Thompson died in August.

“It's great. He was an important part of my life when he first started recruiting me to the day he died,” Georgetown coach Patrick Ewing said. “He was always a person I could pick up the phone and talk to. Give any advice I might need and shaping my coaching career. It's a great honor for the Big East to have the award in his name, the things he fought for over the course of his life.”

MINORITY REPRESENTATION

Five of the 11 Big East coaches are Black, which is one of the highest percentages across college basketball. That fact is not lost on them.

“The Big East is at the forefront of having minority coaches at the helm,” Ewing said. “They took a chance on a high school coach (Thompson) and he proved he was up to the task. Even when we won the championship he was given an opportunity that a lot of people who looked like him weren’t given the opportunity. great to be sitting here as a head coach at Georgetown.”

Ackerman announced that players will be wearing Black Lives Matter patches this year on their uniforms.

PARTIAL SCHEDULE

The Big East announced its conference schedule through the month of December with play beginning Dec. 11 with three games. Ackerman hopes to have the rest of the schedule out within a month.

“We broke our schedule into two pieces to take more time to see what makes sense for us in January or February,” Ackerman said “There are models on the table that best suit our needs and provide the safest environment.""

BLUEJAYS STAR

Marcus Zegarowski of Creighton was picked as the conference's preseason player of the year.

Zegarowski’s season ended before the start of the Big East Tournament last March as he was sidelined with a torn meniscus in his right knee.

“He’s in a great spot. body looks great,"" McDermott said. ""Now it’s a matter of getting timing back from being out three to four months.”

REST OF THE RANKINGS

Creighton received the other two first-place votes from league coaches. It's the highest preseason position for the Bluejays since they joined the conference for the 2013-14 season. Providence was picked third. ... UConn, which returns to the conference after a seven-year absence, was predicted to come in fourth, just ahead of Seton Hall. The Pirates have to replace Big East Player of the Year Myles Powell. Marquette, Xavier and Butler were the next three, with St. John’s, DePaul and Georgetown rounding out the preseason poll.",,
More than 30 college teams to play early games at casino,"A resort casino on tribal land in Connecticut is finalizing plans to host more than 30 college basketball teams as it becomes a modified bubble for several early-season tournaments, including two being moved from New York.

The Mohegan Sun has teamed up with the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which holds it's men's Tip-Off Tournament and Women's Challenge there every year, and the Gazelle Group, which runs the Empire Classic and the Legends Classic in New York.

The organizers plan to hold those tournaments and several other “pods” of games, which will get names in the next few weeks, at at the Mohegan Sun, which is owned by the Mohegan Tribe and includes a 10,000-seat arena that is home to the WNBA's Connecticut Sun.

“It's a single site, secluded location, with enormous square footage for social distancing,"" said Greg Procino, vice president of basketball operations for the Hall of Fame. ""There are a lot of things that will work in our favor, ”

Rick Giles, the president of the Gazelle Group, that they are still finalizing plans for some games, but they expect about 35 teams from more than a dozen conferences will participate at what they are dubbing “Bubbleville” between Nov. 25 and Dec. 5, with up to seven games per day.

There will be at least nine “pods” of games, beginning with the Empire Classic on Nov. 25-26, which will include Villanova, Baylor, Arizona State and Boston College.

UConn, USC, Virginia, Florida, St. John's, UMass, Vanderbilt, BYU, Louisville, North Carolina State and other men's and women's programs also have agreed to play, organizers said.

Officials from Gazelle and the Hall of Fame were meeting Friday with casino officials to finalize some of the details.

“We’ve been able to combine and leverage both our organizations and strengths to create something bigger than what we originally had,” Giles said. “I don’t know if either organization individually could have pulled off what we’re about to do next month.""

The Mohegan Sun has already developed protocols for coronavirus testing, cleaning and managing sports during the pandemic. It also has its own medical staff and facilities to treat and isolate anyone who may be infected.

The resort teamed with Viacom over the summer to produce televised boxing matches and mixed martial arts events.

Tom Cantone, the senior vice president for sports and entertainment at Mohegan Sun, said what they've created is not a full bubble like the NBA and WNBA had in Florida, but a highly controlled environment.

“We’re just following the playbook we’ve already established and has been working brilliantly,” Cantone said. “We will just continue to do what we’ve been doing with our doctors and protocols. So far, it’s worked flawlessly.”

Each team will be tested upon arrival. Each school will have its own secured floor in the resort's 34-story tower hotels along with meeting and catered dining areas. The resort's 125,000-square-foot exposition center will be converted into a practice facility, with courts on which some games also will be played. The teams will move around through designated “back of the house” corridors so they don't interact with the public.

The organizers plan to use a pool of about 25 officials, who also will be housed at the resort for those two weeks.

The casino had already installed safety devices as part of its reopening in June, including ultraviolet lighting and special filters in its HVAC system.

The organizers are not planning to allow fans at the games, but said that could change if the coronavirus metrics suggest it would be safe to allow a limited number of people into the arena, Procino said. The media will be set up in sky boxes and postgame news conferences will be done by teleconference.

Giles said the details of how often and what type of coronavirus testing will be done are still being worked out, because each conference has its own requirements.

“That's been a real challenge,” he said. “I would love to see a unified set of consistent protocols that all conferences can sign onto. That would make interconference play much easier.”",,
Penn State coach Pat Chambers resigns after investigation,"Pat Chambers resigned as Penn State's basketball coach Wednesday following an internal investigation by the school into allegations of inappropriate conduct.

Chambers, 49, had been at Penn State for nine years and was coming off the team’s best season under his directions.

Penn State athletic director Sandy Barbour said during a press news conference that she would not disclose details of the school's investigation, but did say NCAA matters were not part of the investigation.

The investigation followed July story by ESPN's “The Undefeated” that quoted a former Penn State player saying Chambers made an insensitive remark to him, referencing a noose during the 2018-19 season.

“As difficult as this news may be, both President (Eric) Barron and I believe this is the right outcome,” Barbour said.

Assistant coach Jim Ferry was elevated to interim coach for the coming season. The start of the NCAA basketball season is slated for Nov. 25. Ferry has previously been head coach at Long Island University-Brooklyn and Duquesne.

Chambers was in the middle of a four-year contract with Penn State that runs through 2021-22 season. He was 148-150 with Penn State, including an NIT championship in 2018.

In a statement to the online sports network Stadium, Chambers said: “This has been an incredibly difficult year for me and my family, and we are in need of a break to re-set and chart our path forward.""

Penn State finished 21-10 last season and was likely to earn an NCAA Tournament berth for the first time since 2011 before the postseason was canceled because of the pandemic.

“Coach Chambers has made many contributions to the program and to this university for which we are grateful,” Barbour said. “The team has been on a positive trajectory.”

Barbour said the players were “very disappointed” to find out about Chambers' departure. Chambers delivered the news.

“Our current players, many of them have good relationships with him,” Barbour said.

Earlier this year, former Penn State player Rasir Bolton, now at Iowa State, made allegations of inappropriate conduct by Chambers to ESPN's “The Undefeated.”

Bolton said that during a particularly difficult stretch for the team in January 2019, Chambers told him: “I want to loosen the noose that’s around your neck.”

Cuomo replaces tough NY travel restrictions with COVID-19 testing mandate,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a new rule Saturday that will require people coming to New York to test negative for COVID-19 at least three days before arrival.

Once they reach the state, travelers must quarantine for three days and then retest on the fourth to ensure they are coronavirus-free, Cuomo added.

CUOMO TO PARTICIPATE IN WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS BRIEFING FOR GOVERNORS AFTER SKIPPING THEM FOR MONTHS

""There'll be no quarantine list, there'll be no metrics,"" Cuomo said during a press conference.

Travelers from 41 states in the country were previously required to self-quarantine for 14 days if traveling from a region deemed a coronavirus hotspot. But New York itself is now on the brink of the threshold for that classification: As of Thursday, the state reported 9.99 new cases per 100,000 people over a seven-day rolling period.

The threshold to be deemed a high-risk area for travel is 10 and some neighboring states have already topped that. Nonetheless, the border states of Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New Jersey will remain exempt from New York's restrictions because of the high frequency of interstate travel daily by workers.

""It would disrupt everything if you quarantined those states,"" Cuomo said, strongly advising travelers to limit their visits to those areas.

Travelers who return to New York in less than 24 hours will not need to take a test before coming back but will need one after a three-day self-quarantine period, the Democratic governor explained.

Pro-Trump actress Kirstie Alley says CNN is 'broadcasting terror' with nonstop coronavirus fearmongering,"Pro-Trump actress Kirstie Alley mocked CNN for “broadcasting terror” with around-the-clock coronavirus fearmongering as she continued to spar with the liberal network.

“They’re terrifying people 24/7 but they don’t have any additional preventatives, they’re saying the same thing. We’ve heard the same thing,” Alley said Sunday on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”

“If they were coming up with new preventatives, I’d be happy to listen, you know? Or, God forbid, we come up with any new therapeutics,” said Alley, emphasizing that she is not trying to downplay the virus' danger.

PRO-TRUMP ACTRESS KIRSTIE ALLEY SLAMS CNN'S COVID COVERAGE: ‘FEAR OF DYING IS THEIR MANTRA’

Last week, Alley’s feud with CNN began when she took to Twitter after tuning into the liberal network to “get their viewpoint” about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and seeing constant fearmongering.

“I now Know why my personal friends who walk around in SHEER TERROR of contracting Covid are simply CNN viewers! I decided to watch CNN myself to get a their viewpoint and oh my God DID I EVER!!!! IF YOU TOO WANT TO LIVE IN TERROR WATCH CNN!! FEAR OF DYING IS THEIR MANTRA! OMG,” Alley tweeted.

KIRSTIE ALLEY RESPONDS TO 'NASTY,' 'HORRIBLE' PEOPLE CRITICIZING HER SUPPORT FOR TRUMP

CNN’s public relations department responded with a snarky tweet directed at the actress in which they inaccurately took a shot at one of her old TV programs and told Alley to wear a mask.

Alley told Carlson that she never tells anyone not to wear a mask and accused CNN of “broadcasting terror.”

“They’re broadcasting terror because it’s a deflection, they don’t… when the thing came out with Biden and is he in cahoots with China? Is he in cahoots with Ukraine? OK, Let’s find out,” Alley said, referring to the ongoing scandal related to Hunter Biden and his father’s alleged overseas business dealings that CNN has largely ignored.

Alley said she recently watched some of the liberal network so she could relate to her friends who believe what CNN preaches. She feels CNN avoids news that is harmful to Democrats and instead regularly sounds the alarm on the dangers of the coronavirus.

“It was like, ‘Oh my God,’ I would be horrified to walk out of the house and it doesn’t do anyone any good,” she said. “We all know, we’re not deaf, we can hear and we can see. Just because we’re voting Republican doesn’t mean we can’t hear or see… we know there is this death count but it’s like they want to stand in the town square and bring out the dead… they act like the only people who get this disease are Democrats.”

Alley then said she is not “downplaying” coronavirus.

“I have friends who have gotten COVID, I had two friends that almost died, I’m not downplaying it. I’m just saying… what good does it do anyone if you’re provoking terror? It makes people commit suicide, it makes people not go to the doctor if they have a different thing happening,” she said. “They won’t show up at the hospital because they’re afraid they’ll get COVID.”

It's no surprise that Alley isn’t a fan of CNN, as she recently announced why she voted for President Trump in the 2016 election and plans to do so again in his reelection bid against Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

“I’m voting for @realDonaldTrump because he’s NOT a politician,” Alley wrote. “I voted for him 4 years ago for this reason and shall vote for him again for this reason. He gets things done quickly and he will turn the economy around quickly. There you have it folks there you have it.”

"‘Baby Yoda’ pumpkin unveiled by Ohio artist, wants people to ‘appreciate his cuteness’","Pumpkin decorating season, it is.

A giant pumpkin has been decorated in a way that may interest “Star Wars” fans.

The gourd, spanning nearly 10 feet across and weighing 451 pounds, has captured the attention of Dublin, Ohio, residents for its resemblance to “Baby Yoda,"" or “The Child,"" from the Disney+ series, “The Mandalorian.”

UTAH PUMPKIN GROWERS BREAK RECORD WITH 8 GOURDS OVER 1,000 POUNDS

The pumpkin, which has been dubbed as “Baby YodaKin,” was designed by Jeanette Paras, who is an artist that has decorated over-the-top pumpkins for more than 30 years at Paras Pumpkins.

Paras unveiled Baby YodaKin on Monday, which reportedly measures 40 inches in diameter and has two 39-inch ears tacked on, according to a company press release.

'NO CARVE' HALLOWEEN PUMPKIN IDEAS

“I want people to look at Baby YodaKin, smile, appreciate his cuteness and enjoy a moment away from everything going on in the world today,” Paras said in a statement. ”We’ve been cooped up for months, watching bad news every day it seems. I considered 'pumpkinizing' the coronavirus, the presidential candidates, [Ruth Bader Ginsburg], Dr. Fauci and others. To me, Baby Yodakin represents the mental health break we need.”

The 451-pound pumpkin that was used to create Baby YodaKin was grown by Scott Kulpa of Galena, Ohio – a village that is around 20 miles away from the city of Dublin.

WHAT IS A 'THANKFUL PUMPKIN'? AND HOW CAN YOU MAKE ONE WITH YOUR FAMILY?

Baby YodaKin is far from Paras’ first attempt at a “celebrity pumpkin.” She has decorated several pumpkins after presidents, politicians, entertainers, athletes and other notable celebrities.

Some famous faces Paras has decorated giant pumpkins to look like include Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un and Kanye West.

Thanksgiving Day dinner during coronavirus pandemic is stressing Americans out even more: study,"As if cooking the Thanksgiving Day feast isn’t nerve-racking enough, a majority of Americans say turkey day will be twice as stressful this year during the pandemic.

And potentially having to run to a grocery store to buy forgotten ingredients on the big day is also worry-inducing for some. Fifty-five percent of respondents said they feel stressed at the thought of having to venture to the store, perhaps fearing they might come in contact with others who could be infected before being around family during the feast.

What’s more, one in 10 Americans surveyed said they will be forgoing the festivities altogether this year due to COVID-19 concerns.

225K couples with pandemic-postponed weddings owe $3.7B in loans,"Weddings are already a huge financial burden on couples and families, but the coronavirus pandemic has added to the frustration for couples who planned to marry this year.

Hundreds of thousands of couples are paying back loans for weddings that haven’t even happened yet, according to a new report.

Last week, online lending platform Loanry reported that 225,000 couples who have postponed their weddings are collectively paying back $3.7 billion in loans they took out to finance those celebrations.

That’s an average of $16,500 per couple.

LONG ISLAND COUNTRY CLUB FINED $17,000 FOR WEDDING WHERE 30 PEOPLE GOT COVID-19

“This last year will have been devastating for many couples,” Loanry’s founder Ethan Taub said in the report. “Especially for the percentage paying off loans for weddings that haven’t happened.”

“However, we can take a positive from this situation. It may have highlighted that an exuberant wedding isn’t always the best option,” Taub added. “The occasion will be memorable no matter how much you spend on it.”

ENGAGED COUPLES ARE MAKING BIG CHANGES TO THEIR WEDDING CELEBRATIONS AMID PANDEMIC: SURVEY

For its report, Loanry used data that shows approximately how many weddings happen every year, how many weddings have been postponed this year, how many personal loans are taken out to pay for weddings and the average wedding cost.

The platform reported that an average of 2 million weddings happen every year in the U.S. -- with the majority of those weddings happening between March and October.

According to data from The Knot published in May, 93% of couples in the U.S. decided to postpone their wedding celebrations.

Of the entire 20 million personal loans taken out in the U.S. last year, 1.5% were specifically to help couples pay for weddings, Loanry reported.

The lending platform had previously found that couples take an average of $16,500 in loans for their weddings, which is just under half of the average wedding cost of $33,900, according to February data from The Knot.

“You should take financing a wedding using a loan very seriously, and we don’t recommend it,” Taub said. “In fact, finding ways to cut costs on your wedding expenses is a far more effective alternative. In this way, you can avoid unnecessary debt yet still enjoy your big day.”

The Republican war on voting doesn't end with Election Day,"So when I tell you that nothing else accurately captures the importance of the next few years for the right to vote in America, please understand that it's not my preference. But how else do you describe a concerted campaign to limit access to the ballot box by any means necessary? It's a war being fought in several theaters at once, in all three branches of government and in every jurisdiction, from the local to the federal.

The GOP's motives aren't secret. Trump put it pretty well during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" in March. ""They had levels of voting that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again,"" the president said in response to Democratic proposals to make it easier and safer for the election to be held despite the coronavirus outbreak — proposals he ultimately rejected.

Trump openly admitting if we made voting easier in America, Republicans wouldn't win elections



Trump: ""The things they had in there were crazy. They had levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again."" pic.twitter.com/x5HmX6uogo — Lis Power (@LisPower1) March 30, 2020

He doubled down on that stance months later when he admitted that he was keeping the U.S. Postal Service underfunded to hamper mail-in voting efforts, claiming without evidence that the practice is rife with fraud. Now, the day before Election Day, another slowdown in postal deliveries is occurring in swing states. In between, Trump has said mail-in balloting is another term for fraud while encouraging his own voters in safely red states to vote early.

Trump knows that he lost the popular vote in 2016 and that an increase of votes from Democrats could prevent a repeat of his much-fetishized winning electoral map. Throughout the rest of the party, there's a similar acknowledgment that greater participation — especially by Black and Hispanic voters — means a dilution of its (also much-fetishized) shrinking pool of white voters.

If their motives are on display, their methods are lit up like Times Square, especially in these recent weeks. Across the country, the need to prevent ""voter fraud"" serves as justification for the GOP's attempted crackdown. But Republican election lawyer Benjamin Ginsberg recently admitted that it's all a myth. ""Proof of systematic fraud has become the Loch Ness Monster of the Republican Party,"" Ginsberg wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. ""People have spent a lot of time looking for it, but it doesn't exist.""

The New York Times last week detailed a half-dozen of the more egregious instances when state Republican parties or the Trump campaign have asked the courts to count fewer ballots. Wisconsin's Republican-dominated Supreme Court ruled Oct. 26 that rather than have to be postmarked by Election Day, ballots now have to arrive at election offices by 8 p.m. Tuesday for election officials to count them, no matter when they were dropped in the mail. A federal appeals court ruled similarly in a Minnesota case, just days before the election. The federal judges warned Minnesotans to find an alternative way to vote for now — they still haven't decided whether any ballots that come in the mail after Election Day will be considered legal.

The Texas GOP has been particularly brazen, refusing to expand limited access to mail-in voting ballots for the general population and restricting each of Texas's 254 counties to only one mail-in ballot drop-off point. That hasn't kept Harris County — home to Houston — from being a model for easing access to voting this year. The fourth-largest city in the U.S. had already topped its total of votes cast in 2016 by Thursday, thanks to options like drive-thru voting and keeping early voting centers open late.

The Texas GOP and the Harris County branch of the party tried to get the drive-thru voting centers shut down — the all-Republican Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit without issuing an order or an opinion on Oct. 22. But U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen has ordered the plaintiffs to appear in an emergency hearing Monday to present their arguments in a lawsuit to throw out more that 100,000 ballots that Houstonites cast at the drive-thru centers. The state Supreme Court tossed out the case, as well, on Sunday, and former Texas House Speaker Joe Straus has denounced it, but who knows how Hanen, who has a history of partisan rulings, will decide?

Republicans have reason to feel confident that their arguments, no matter how specious, will play well before the federal bench. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has spent the Trump administration loading the courts with conservative judges — 220 of them, according to The Washington Post's count, including three Supreme Court justices, ""53 circuit court judges, 162 district court judges and two to the U.S. Court of International Trade."" The investment is paying off: The Post also found that federal judges whom Trump has nominated have ruled against efforts to make voting easier in ""nearly three out of four opinions issued in federal voting-related cases.""

The Supreme Court isn't immune, with several justices threatening to intervene in numerous states' vote-counting processes. Justice Brett Kavanaugh's concurring opinion in the court's denial of an expansion of Wisconsin's window to count absentee ballots raised eyebrows for its mention of the Supreme Court's 2000 election decision, Bush v. Gore, claiming federal courts should step in during some state electoral disputes. (Normally, that's left up to state supreme courts, given that states set their own election laws.)

Aside from being riddled with errors, Kavanaugh's opinion also gave a legal veneer to the president's unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud through the Postal Service, claiming, without data, that ""chaos and suspicions of impropriety"" can ensue if mail-in ballots in particular are counted after Election Day. He also echoed Trump in his belief that, contra history, states should ""be able to definitively announce the results of the election on election night, or as soon as possible thereafter.""

Insane rhetoric from Kavanaugh decrying ""chaos & suspicions of impropriety that can ensue if thousands of absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election""



This comes on some night Trump tweets winner of election must be announced Nov 3 pic.twitter.com/Y9iZcBGOGy — Ari Berman (@AriBerman) October 27, 2020

Kavanaugh's colleague Samuel Alito, meanwhile, has said the Supreme Court may have to examine whether ballots that arrive after Election Day in Pennsylvania should be counted. The court, in a 4-4 split, rejected hearing a case seeking to overturn the state Supreme Court's decision allowing ballots that arrive as late as Friday to count. Alito authored a dissent saying that he and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas all view the Pennsylvania Republican Party's petition as still on the docket, giving the court another chance to invalidate any latecomers.

The same people who pushed the reshaping of the courts are also providing a backbone for Republican efforts to count fewer votes and shrink voter rolls. At the center of this effort is Leonard Leo, one of the architects of the current federal judiciary. Leo is a former executive vice president of the Federalist Society, the conservative and libertarian law organization that has worked for decades to place its members into seats in the judiciary.

""Alongside lawyers who also work for the Republican National Committee, during this election cycle Leo and his team have teed up lawsuits about voter rolls, run ads and filed court briefs to support litigation against mail-in voting,"" NBC News reported Sunday. ""Leo is also on the advisory board of Lawyers for Trump, which is recruiting a battalion of attorneys ready to go to court in the wake of the election.""

These litigative efforts perfectly sync with previous anti-voting tactics in a strategy that has played out for decades. From the North Carolina Republican Party's blatantly racist gerrymandering efforts to the campaign for strict voter ID laws, it's all part and parcel of reducing the number of people who can vote.

Republicans have also consciously negated efforts to correct these limits. Florida's electorate voted in 2018 to amend the state Constitution to allow former felons to vote, offering restored rights to hundreds of thousands of people. State Republican lawmakers in response passed a law requiring that these new potential voters pay off any fines and court fees they'd built up to become eligible to vote. The law was ruled unconstitutional — a federal judge rightly called the move a ""poll tax"" — before it was reinstated by the conservative 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. ProPublica reported in October that as a result, ""fewer than 8 percent of Florida's felons have registered to vote since Amendment 4 passed. That's a much lower rate, though over a shorter time frame, than in other states that have restored their voting rights.""

So far, these are all methods to legally keep people from voting — but as Election Day approaches, the fear of violence from state and nonstate actors is on the rise. Trump's campaign has recruited an army of ""poll watchers,"" raising fears of intimidation directed at minority voters. He also expressed support for members of a caravan that surrounded a Biden campaign bus in Texas, forcing an event to be canceled. Beyond Trump himself, police in North Carolina's Alamance County deployed pepper spray Saturday against people marching to the polls. And in Michigan, the Democratic secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, is appealing a judge's decision to allow firearms at polling places.

Election Day will be cathartic, acting as a collective release of breath held for months. But as encouraging as the 24-hour voting sites and predictions of record youth turnout are, this battle won't end in the days or weeks after the election is — eventually — called. None of these systems that the Republicans have put into place will automatically vanish, and as we've seen, there's no telling how long past Tuesday their onslaught will last. But the results of the election will set the rules for the next 10 years, allowing Democrats a chance to change the tide of the conflict.",2020-11-02 10:09:36+00:00,

Once feeling hopeless and helpless, these young adults are claiming their power by speaking up at the ballot box against a president who bullied them.

A 2016 study by the Government Accountability Office found that 60 percent of polling places had at least one accessibility issue. And with a global pandemic, the country's largest minority group will face even greater barriers to voting this year.

And it's not getting better. Just a last month, the Supreme Court struck down a decision that would have allowed curbside voting in Alabama, which would have accommodated voters with disabilities to vote without entering crowded polling places during a pandemic in a state that doesn't even require masks.

""Unfortunately Donald Trump won in 2016,"" Sydney Sinatra, a former student of Catalano's who recently turned 19, told me. ""I was so sad and not happy, and now it turns out that Donald Trump is being the worst president on Earth."" Sinatra can't work at her job at the New York Public Library because of the pandemic, and she is frustrated by the president's response to a virus that makes her more vulnerable, given her developmental disability.

""I am excited to vote for Joe Biden because he will listen to scientists,"" she said. ""He listens and is kind. ... Donald Trump bullies everyone and is mean to everyone.""

Sinatra is passionate about climate change and a woman's right to choose. And just like any Gen Zer, she's also worried about the president's threats to her favorite social media app. ""Donald Trump wants to ban my TikTok because he hates China and is mad that TikTokers make fun of him,"" she said.

For Jared Bazemore, an extroverted young man who just turned 18, voting isn't something he has to do, it's something he gets to do. ""This is my first time voting, and I'm so excited,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to voting ... and I hope Joe Biden wins the election.""

His friend Hadah Medford, 19, seems equally as jubilant about voting for the first time in such a crucial election. Medford usually works collecting garbage and planting flowers in Battery Park, and he feels frustrated that Trump's handling of the virus is still forcing him to stay home and miss out on valuable work training. Medford joined the 1 million other workers with disabilities who lost their jobs because of the pandemic.

""I miss hugging people,"" he said. He expressed frustration at seeing Trump campaign maskless when masks are what protect people like him in particular, as someone who is 10 times more likely to die from Covid-19. When asked what he thought about Biden's wearing a mask, he answered, ""That means he's on our side.""

Mahliek Benjamin, 21, echoed a deep frustration that the pandemic is disproportionately affecting his life. ""Trump's got to go,"" he said. ""He doesn't care about poor people. He just cares about rich people."" His regular shifts at Tao Restaurant in Manhattan were part of his work training program, which allowed him to continually work on the skills he needs to apply for his dream job of becoming a firefighter. But the pandemic has put all those plans on hold. ""I'm struggling right now. ... It's delaying my career.""

But it goes deeper than just Trump's handling of the pandemic: ""He doesn't care about any of us,"" Benjamin said. As it did many other voters, the Black Lives Matter movement helped activate Bazemore, Medford and Benjamin. As young Black men with disabilities, they are the most at risk of police brutality in Trump's America. Up to half of people killed by the police have disabilities, researchers found in 2015, with chilling cases like the one of Daniel Prude, 41, a Black autistic man who was killed by police in March in Rochester, New York. ""It's not safe to be around the police,"" Medford said. When asked what he would like the police to do differently, he simply said: ""Stop killing us.""

Young Black men with disabilities are the most at risk of police brutality in Trump’s America. Up to half of people killed by the police have a disabilities.

Bazemore said that he wanted to participate in the racial justice protests in New York City over the summer but that his parents were too worried to let him join. ""I was really shocked and very devastated when I found out Breonna Taylor was killed,"" he said. ""I was shocked about that. I couldn't believe it with my own eyes."" When I asked what he would say to Biden, he replied: ""Please save us, and tell the police ... tell them not to kill us anymore. Tell them to be easy on us.""

With an estimated 38 million voters with disabilities, Sinatra, Bazemore, Medford and Benjamin are members of no small voting bloc. While their demographic typically has lower voter turnout than other groups because of barriers of access to voting, the fact that, according to 2016 data, disabled people make up 1 in 6 eligible voters means they have the potential power to sway an election.

But while people with disabilities face some of the most regressive and outrageously overt forms of voter suppression, they have also turned society's systemic ableism into creative forms of resistance, such as a new nonpartisan app designed to help people with disabilities vote. Founded by Dylan Bulkeley-Krane, the disability rights policy coordinator for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, it is one of the first accessible voting apps — most of the existing ones aren't — an entrepreneurial pursuit endorsed by Sens. Cory Booker and Tammy Duckworth. The app, called Brink Election Guide, offers ballot information, polling locations and resources for voters who face discrimination or other hurdles at the polls.

Bulkeley-Krane said voters with disabilities like him have been more activated than ever, especially during the Trump administration. ""This election will see the highest level of participation by disabled voters than any in the past, building on historical gains in 2016 and 2018,"" he said. ""We will see this record high turnout, despite the global pandemic and historically long lines, because the disability community is determined to have their voices heard and rights protected.""

And if the enthusiasm and determination of the disabled voters I spoke to is any indication, Trump's days in the White House may be numbered.",2020-11-02 10:08:00+00:00,
Voting has a violent history in the U.S. There's a reason we're talking about it so openly now.,"If you read the news these days, there's a good chance you'll see that sociologists believe the United States is on the verge of sustained political violence, that our democracy is on a knife's edge, that voters openly fear a race war and that Facebook is adopting its tools for ""at-risk"" countries to head off post-election chaos in the U.S. When I get messages from friends asking me whether they should retweet the threat of Election Day violence by a leader of the Oath Keepers militia — after it was broadcast to millions on Alex Jones' radio show — my mind hovers uneasily between two thoughts: The first one is that we are about to have an election in which the threat of violence is real and spreading. I can't remember an election when anything outside of sporadic disorder felt possible.

And then sense and history kick in: Political violence, most especially to prevent Black people and other minorities from voting and attaining power, has been a feature of American elections since our country's founding. In the 20th century, white supremacists kindled ethnic resentment and sought to delegitimize a pluralistic democracy. As MSNBC's Chris Hayes has pointed out, referring to the post-World War II Jim Crow South, stationing armed men at polling places was a ""key feature of that movement.""

Also, none of this is abstract. It's happened in American history. Armed men at polling places were a key feature of the movement of terroristic violencethat murdered multi-racial democracy in the south and replaced it with a one-party apartheid authoritarian regime. — Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) October 27, 2020

One hundred years ago, in 1920, Black residents of Orange County, Florida, spent the summer braving deep, humid swamps to register hundreds of new voters in the county. They conspired with sympathetic white Republicans, who wanted those votes. Black people had been almost completely politically disenfranchised — re-disenfranchised — for decades in central Florida, with the exception of Eatonville, a small town in the center of the county. Orlando was the county seat, and its police chief was a white supremacist, who according to history feared the power of the Black franchise.

On Election Day, when several Black men in Ocoee, a city in the northern part of the county, wouldn't leave polling sites as ordered, a group of white men, helped by the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, tracked them down. Having twice been turned away from the polls, one Black man, Mose Norman, returned to his precinct with a gun. The white gang reportedly used the specter of armed Black men as a pretext. Some historians call the following events a ""race riot,"" but that euphemizes what happened: A throng of white men proceeded to massacre as many as 50 Black people. There is no record of the exact number of people killed, because no one was ever convicted of the killings. When it comes to elections, this massacre and similar events remain open wounds throughout the country.

There is no record of the exact number of people killed, because no one was ever convicted of the killings. When it comes to elections, this massacre and similar events remain open wounds throughout the country.

I grew up around the same area in central Florida, and I had no idea this had happened until I began researching state-sanctioned violence against Black people. It certainly wasn't taught in local schools. (Only as of this year was it included in the public school history curriculum.) There's a new conversation that's been sparked in 2020 about violence — racial violence, and also election violence. Reportedly 3 in 4 voters expect this Election Day to be violent. A key difference is that this year, more white people fear being violently deterred from exercising their constitutional right to vote, and for most white people, they're experiencing this type of fear for the first time. This in itself is a significant fact — that we are talking about election violence more because of who is being affected by it — and it says nearly everything you need to know about racial inequality in America.

Violent domestic extremism has become a leading threat in the country, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Far-right groups have more or less been granted permission by President Donald Trump to incorporate violent imagery and threats in service of their political agendas. When Trump calls out Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for refusing to open up her state during a pandemic, his audience knows that they can start to shout ""lock her up,"" which, even in the most benign interpretation, means the arrest and detention of a governor for committing no crimes (which, as we know, allegedly really almost happened). In its most extreme interpretation, ""lock her up"" is an incitement of violence.

When I grew up in Orange County, politics was a joy. My family, led by my mom, instilled in me a love of politics. She was a Tsitizen for Tsongas in 1992, and one day, we hosted a fundraiser to help Paul Tsongas, the quirky, brainy senator from Massachusetts, raise money for his on-again, off-again presidential bid. I was 13, and I decided to wear a badge marked ""security,"" which was primo timing, because the candidate had just lost his Secret Service detail. I loved election days and nights; I once set up a ballot box outside our garage. As a kid, politics was so fun for me.

It took me a while to fall out of love. When I was a reporter in Washington, D.C., the institutionalized b.s. grated on my sense of truth. I had to pretend that there were two equal sides to a story that had at least seven. I had to pretend that, for example, Republican efforts to ""prevent voting fraud"" had a shred of credibility to them, which is why I wasn't allowed to describe them as ""efforts to suppress the Black vote."" But what finally did me in was a realization, perhaps too late, that what was great fun for me as a kid was, for so many others, a deadly threat, an unending war for dignity and the basic right to participate politically. And even then I was ignorant of what had happened a few miles north of where I grew up.

In her book ""Political Emotions: Why Love Matters for Justice,"" philosopher Martha Nussbaum writes of the many attempts by so-called enlightened countries to create a civil religion that would bind together its citizens, especially during emergencies. At the core of these efforts were attempts to ""expand empathy,"" she writes, and reduce the influence of human greed and egoism. In our modern life, as we approach an election with extreme trepidation, we might be tempted to ground our appeals to others in respect. I disagree with you, but I respect you; you disagree with me, and yet you respect me. But respect, Nussbaum writes, ""is cold and inert, insufficient to overcome the bad tendencies that lead human beings to tyrannize one over the other.""

Overt election violence against Black people and Indigenous people and people of color has waned over decades. But the bone-deep sense of dread that many people feel about elections remains.

Overt election violence against Black people and Indigenous people and people of color has waned over decades. But the bone-deep sense of dread that many people feel about elections remains. The reality is that enough white people still see Black political power as a threat to justify extraordinary departures from some of our deepest intuitions about what a mature democracy looks like. Voter suppression is only a more banal descendant of racial violence. To move the conversation forward, we must first acknowledge that a major reason we are at this threshold is that we lack the mechanisms to hold the Republican Party accountable for its efforts to willfully suppress and depress the vote.

My dream is that politics becomes fun for everyone: hard-fought, serious, weighty — but also exuberant and thrilling and inspiring. But based on our current climate, we are far from that reality.",2020-10-30 17:13:00+00:00,
"Trump has found a whole new way to make the government worse, whether he wins or loses","When President Donald Trump said ""these people are sick"" during remarks to donors before his final debate with former Vice President Joe Biden last week, he wasn't talking about the nearly 9 million people in the United States inflicted with Covid-19 or the resurgent pandemic that seems to spread wherever he holds a rally. The people Trump was referring to as ""sick"" appeared to be the civil service professionals who devote their careers to serving our country. ""You have a lot of people from past administrations,"" he complained, ""and they're civil service. I fired some.""

The people Trump was referring to as “sick” appeared to be the civil service professionals who devote their careers to serving our country.

The comments spoke to Trump's unprecedented assault on professionalism in the ranks of our federal government, which he now promises to accelerate should he win a second term. Specifically, they expanded on a sweeping executive order he had signed the day before to reclassify thousands of professional civil service jobs as ""political,"" thus permitting the president to replace professionals and experts throughout the federal government — who swear an oath to the Constitution, not to any president — with sycophants. In response, Ronald Sanders, Trump's own appointee to the Federal Salary Council, which helps oversee the professional civil service, resigned in protest. In a letter, Sanders warned that Trump's order was a ""smokescreen"" designed ""to replace apolitical expertise with political obeisance.""

NEW: Ronald Sanders, a Trump appointee and chairman of the Federal Salary Council has resigned effective immediately, citing Trump's recent exec order on federal worker classification changes as the cause.

If Trump wins, he has now ensured he'll have the power to rapidly accelerate these damaging trends. Even if he loses, in which case the executive order would likely not be upheld by Biden, it will take years to restore the depleted ranks of experts across federal departments and agencies, from the State Department to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It's a hallmark of the Trump administration that in four short years it has managed to degrade America's professional and nonpolitical institutions, from our intelligence services to our diplomatic corps to the doctors and scientists in our public health agencies. The president is now sending every signal that his second term, in this regard, would be even worse.

No doubt, there could be more flexibility and discretion in reorganizing federal departments to face new crises. The interagency process can be cumbersome, a frustration felt by Trump's predecessors. (Harry Truman famously said of his incoming successor: ""He'll sit here and say, 'Do this! Do that!' and nothing will happen. Poor Ike — it won't be a bit like the Army."")

But as Sanders warned, Trump's reforms don't aim to increase efficiency — rather, they aim to enable a wholesale de-professionalization of government service. It's part of the broader story of Trump's presidency, which shows little appreciation for the very idea of service in behalf of the American people, as opposed to service in behalf of a president's personal interests.

No matter what, America’s public servants must know a president has their back.

I spent two years during the Trump administration in the State Department as the president's special envoy, helping to lead the campaign against the Islamic State. I held the same position under Barack Obama, and before that, I served on George W. Bush's National Security Council. These were not career posts: I served at the pleasure of the president, like most people in positions in the upper ranks of an administration. But it would have been impossible to get anything done, let alone competently, without depending on career professionals on my staff and in the ranks of our nonpolitical diplomatic, military and intelligence corps.

One of my colleagues in the Trump administration was Michael McKinley, a four-time U.S. ambassador and then senior adviser to Mike Pompeo, Trump's secretary of state. McKinley quit in late 2019. Last week, he explained why, writing that the damage Trump has done to the diplomatic corps is likely to be ""generational"" after ""the department turned its back on its own staff.""

For McKinley, the last straw was a White House campaign to denigrate Marie Yovanovitch, our career ambassador in Ukraine, after she refused to go along with a scheme to withhold security assistance from the country until it launched a fraudulent investigation of Biden. McKinley resigned when nobody at the State Department stood up for Yovanovitch, who had dedicated her professional life to serving our country since the Reagan administration. He rightly warns about ""the misuse of career professionals in Washington and abroad to pursue a U.S. electoral advantage.""

No matter what, America's public servants must know a president has their back. What holds true for Yovanovitch when facing off against Russians in Ukraine applies equally to scientists and doctors in our public health institutions (who are ""idiots,"" according to Trump). We count on them to tell the truth even when it may be difficult to hear or it is an unwanted intrusion for a president living in a world shaped by social media and cable news. Competent presidents seek out the truth, regularly inviting government experts into the Oval Office and asking them, in the words of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, to ""lay out the facts cold and hard"" before major decisions are made.

It's up to a president to create an environment for such truth-telling, which starts with showing respect for the professionals in the ranks who do the work every day. Those professionals need to know that they will not be penalized or shunned after reporting troubling facts to superiors or standing up for American values overseas.

In early 2016, I was flying to Turkey with then-Vice President Biden. We had a difficult set of meetings with Turkish officials, including the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who was cracking down on dissent at home and doing little at the time to stem the flow of foreign fighters in and out of Syria. Biden's immediate focus, however, was the U.S. ambassador, John Bass, a career diplomat who was under fire from Turkish officials for calling out the recent crackdown as contrary to democratic values. Biden understood that for an ambassador to be effective, everyone in the host country had to know that he or she spoke for the United States.

So he went out of his way to make it clear — before he even met with Turkish officials — that he had Bass' back. On the first morning of our visit, he spoke to the media about John. ""He speaks for my government,"" he said. ""He speaks for the American people."" That is what any president should say about professionals serving our country in tough assignments, whether for those protecting us from diseases at home or those representing us in foreign capitals abroad.

It could not be a sharper contrast to the current occupant of the Oval Office, who seems to have nobody's back but his own. That should be an important consideration when voting Nov. 3.",2020-10-28 09:01:00+00:00,
Trump loves white men. These 'recovering Republicans' no longer love him back.,"Purely based on voting behavior, it appears many white men love President Donald Trump.

In fact, love might be an understatement given that white men without college degrees voted for Trump at a rate higher than for any other candidate in the last 36 years. In 2016, when I reported from one of his rallies in Marshalltown, Iowa, men told me they would vote for him even if he shot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue. Today, they're risking their own lives on his behalf, braving potentially super-spreader events to line up for the chance to see him.

Maybe that's why, at his first rally since he tested positive for the coronavirus, the president offered to show his male fans affection first. ""I feel so powerful,"" the president shouted. ""I'll kiss everyone in that audience. I'll kiss the guys ... and the beautiful women."" I guess ""big fat kisses"" from a potentially contagious president work in the reverse order of lifeboats — it's the men who go first.

But with the election around the corner, some white men are starting to feel a little less loyal to the man who has promised them the moon and the stars. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that Trump's lead among white male voters without college degrees has dropped from an enormous 35 points to a significant but narrowing 19 points. Every election cycle, we hear that white men can't be swayed, but what about the ones who can no longer justify staying in Trump's Republican Party?

Every election cycle, we hear that white men can't be swayed, but what about the ones who can no longer justify staying in Trump's Republican Party?

""Unfortunately, I'm voting for Joe Biden,"" Nick Stevens, 30, a Texas small-business owner, told me resolutely after he responded to a call-out I made on social media looking for conservative men having second thoughts about Trump. When we talked on the phone, Stevens said he wasn't leaving the party because he's particularly energized by Biden, but rather because he just can't bring himself to support a man like Trump. Stevens, who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, said Trump's performance of manhood has pushed him away from the GOP. ""He feeds off a particular view of masculinity that bullies people,"" Stevens said.

Other men described being embarrassed by Trump's interpretation of strength. ""He's made this party untenable,"" Nick Jesteadt, 30, a former conservative evangelist, told me over the phone. ""There is just no compassion. And these softer skills and personality traits that shouldn't be gender-based"" are now once again being tied to gender. Jesteadt described Trump's brash style of leadership, his repeated verbal abuse and his inability to listen as ""old classic masculinity"" and ""stuff you see from '60s dad sitcoms.""

Patrick Carr, who introduced himself as a ""recovering Republican,"" voiced a similar sentiment. ""Trump's version of masculinity would have everyone believe that his opinion is the only one that matters because he is president,"" he said. As it did for most of the men I spoke to, the president's treatment of women specifically touched a nerve. ""He openly lusted after his daughter and throws women away when they no longer please him,"" Carr said. While he's always voted Republican, this year he's voting for Biden and Kamala Harris.

A secondary theme also emerged in many of these conversations. While the men often described themselves as recovering Republicans, many spoke like recovering toxic masculinity addicts. What they despised about Trump was a machismo they once emulated. John Chapman, 36, a former Republican who interned for the Republican National Committee and spent a summer working for the Bush administration, told me Trump felt like a ""symptom of the toxic masculinity we all grew up idolizing."" He also said this model of masculinity has long been central to the Republican Party, dating to the days of Ronald Reagan.

""I was drinking the Kool-Aid so much that I named my dog Reagan,"" Chapman told me. But now that he has seen this model fail for him personally, he sees through it politically. ""My reaction to Trump's version of masculinity is just realizing how fragile he must be,"" he said. Stevens agrees. Trump's ""handling of Covid right now, to a T, describes me two years ago,"" he said. ""I had an issue for six years that I refused to go the doctor for, and it was almost fatal, because 'I was too tough for that.'""

And there's another element at play here: the men who identify with being bullied like Biden. Witnessing Biden be mocked as ""weak"" and humiliated for having a speech disability is just one more reason not to vote for Trump, Stevens said. Meanwhile, Biden's own expression of masculinity — he's not afraid to wear a mask or to campaign alongside an equally smart and successful wife — represents a more evolved gender identity that Stevens admires.

At this point, I know what you're probably thinking: Another piece trying to get inside the heads of white men? But while it's true that white men are still the most privileged class in our society, their progress has been relatively stagnant compared to that of other groups. Black women's incomes have more than doubled (as they should and must continue to do!), while the salaries of your average white men haven't. But this stagnation is a relevant point when it comes to their mindsets and, notably, voting patterns. In 2016, white men responded overwhelmingly to Trump's populist message. He said he would take care of them. He said he would make them feel like the providers and breadwinners society tells them to be.

But while Trump said he would take care of all white men, he has taken care of only some white men: the ultra-rich ones. As many have lost jobs and housing, Jeff Bezos has more than doubled his wealth since the beginning of the pandemic — a jump helped along by Trump's tax cuts. Your average white male voter isn't struggling because a woman or a person of color took his job; he is struggling because a select group of white men are hogging resources and paying taxes at a lower rate than the vast majority of Americans. Blaming immigrants for the stagnation many white men feel is a convenient distraction from the fact that it has been enabled by people like Trump himself.

Maybe that's why the president is so committed to the ""Macho Man"" bit.

Maybe that's why the president is so committed to the ""Macho Man"" bit, consistently playing the song at his rallies even as thousands of people continue to die. The president, who claims to be the ultimate man's man, has abysmally failed to both provide for and protect the American public. He's probably never going to stop playing the role of the male champion on TV. But at least some men are starting to see through the lie.",2020-10-16 09:00:00+00:00,
Covid-19 is forcing Americans to ask what we owe each other,"America's Covid-19 crisis raises a big question: Are we going to do the right thing? Or, to put it in more tangible terms: Are you going to wear a mask?

The jury's still out on that one, as evidenced by gatherings of mostly maskless White House staff members and a group of armed, angry men who are alleged to have plotted to abduct Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, outraged over the state's coronavirus restrictions. President Donald Trump says he's learned a lot from contracting Covid-19, but clearly not enough to stop him from holding events at the White House or to cancel campaign rallies.

We're seeing more instances in which people's thoughtlessness is getting others hurt or even killed in some cases — and not from the virus, but from physical violence, which is what happened in a tragic event in upstate New York when a bar patron named Rocco Sapienza asked another patron, Donald Lewinski, to put on a mask. The district attorney alleged that the non-masked Lewinksi, 65, shoved Sapienza, 80, with both hands. Sapienza hit his head as he fell to the floor, and he never regained consciousness. Lewinski pleaded not guilty to criminally negligent homicide.

But there's also evidence that not all accountability is dead. Last week, ""Saturday Night Live"" uninvited its scheduled musical guest, country singer Morgan Wallen, after a video surfaced showing him partying at a bar in Tuscaloosa, Alabama — behavior that violated the show's Covid-19 protocols. Wallen took to Instagram with a heartfelt apology. The moment was significant because his apology was not, as so many are, ""I'm sorry if what I did upset you,"" but rather ""I am sorry, and what I did upset me."" Wallen understood where he went wrong and was genuinely remorseful for his actions and their potential consequences.

For a more historical model of accountability, back in 1951, the U.S. Naval Academy had a big problem with students who were cheating on tests, which led two midshipmen, William Lawrence and Ross Perot — yes, that Ross Perot ­— to create what's now called the honor concept. The main premise of the honor concept isn't to do right for fear of being punished, but to do right ... because it's right.

The coronavirus pandemic seems to have revealed how we truly feel about our fellow Americans.

Perhaps the academy, on the recent occasion of its 175th birthday, gives us the right word for the ideal so many of us are falling short of today as we fight a global pandemic: honor. Within the Navy's core values (honor, courage and commitment), honor encompasses uncompromising integrity, being forthright even with bad news and making decisions without regard to personal consequences. This applies to doing the right thing even when you think no one is looking (for example, wearing a mask).

Notable Naval Academy graduates include the first American in space, Alan Shepard, the late Sen. John McCain, NBA Hall of Famer David Robinson and perhaps its most distinguished graduate: former governor, former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Jimmy Carter.

So much of today's news has to do with accountability and trust, and the coronavirus pandemic seems to have revealed how we truly feel about our fellow Americans. The White House physician, Dr. Sean Conley, is a Navy commander, too. Based on how much we still don't know about Trump's health, these values matter now like never before.",2020-10-14 09:00:00+00:00,

Super typhoon kills at least 10 in Philippines,"Typhoon Goni killed at least 10 people in the eastern Philippines on Sunday while nearly one million people were evacuated to emergency shelters, according to The Associated Press.

Nine people in the province of Albay were killed and at least one was located in Catanduanes.

The storm tore through the Catanduanes province with winds up to 140 mph and gusts of 174 mph, destroying about 150 houses, AP reported. The homes were damaged by volcanic mudflows triggered by the storm.

The typhoon touched part of the country’s capital city Manila, but left it relatively untouched. Manila’s main airport was shut down for one day, canceling dozens of international and domestic flights.

Goni is one of the most powerful typhoons to occur this year. The storm hit provinces that were still recovering from a deadly typhoon one week ago. The Philippines is also in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic with the second most cases in Southeast Asia, after Indonesia, according the the AP.

The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone nations in the world, being located in the so-called “Ring of Fire” where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen frequently, AP noted.

The Hill has reached out to Donald Trump Jr.'s staff for further comment.

The U.S. is experiencing a massive surge in coronavirus cases, confirming almost 90,000 infections on Thursday alone, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. also had close to 1,000 deaths Thursday, and more are expected as death counts lag behind hospitalizations.

A recent analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine indicates that by January, about 2,250 Americans could be dying every day from COVID-19, close to the peak of almost 2,600 a day back in April.

President Trump has also sought to downplay the virus leading up to Tuesday's election, accusing the media of blowing the impact of COVID-19 out of proportion.

The president has also repeatedly and misleadingly claimed that the reason the U.S. has more cases is because there are more tests being administered. Friday morning he tweeted, ""More Testing equals more Cases. We have best testing. Deaths WAY DOWN.""

"Heisman Trophy favorite Trevor Lawrence tests positive for coronavirus, will miss game","Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence, a favorite to win the Heisman Trophy and to be the No. 1 NFL draft pick if he leaves school at the end of the season, has tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss Saturday’s game against Boston College.

“I have tested positive for COVID-19, and my symptoms have been relatively mild while I’m following the protocol from Clemson and the ACC,” Lawrence said in a statement shared on Twitter. “The only thing that hurts is missing an opportunity to be with my teammates this weekend and play the game I love.”

“I hate that I can’t be there, but I’ll be watching from isolation and pulling for our guys while I wait for the opportunity to rejoin the team,” the player added.

Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney said in a statement Thursday night that the quarterback was isolating and would not be playing in Saturday’s game.

“While we certainly will miss Trevor, this is an opportunity for other guys to step up and we're excited about competing against a very good BC team on Saturday,” Swinney wrote.

The coach’s statement did not say if other players on the team, ranked first in the country, had also been tested or if any had come into close contact with Lawrence.

ADVERTISEMENT

Under coronavirus guidelines established by the ACC’s medical advisory group, any player who contracts the virus must isolate for at least 10 days after the test and no longer be showing symptoms before returning to practice.

According to ESPN, this guideline would mean that Lawrence could potentially also miss Clemson’s upcoming game against No. 4 Notre Dame, scheduled for Nov. 7.

Lawrence is a favorite for the Heisman Trophy, awarded to the most valuable player in NCAA football. He led Clemson to the national championship two seasons ago.

So far this season, Lawrence has completed 71 percent of his throws and 21 total touchdowns through six games, ESPN reported.

Many others among college football have tested positive for COVID-19, raising concerns on the safety of players and the continuation of the seasons.

On Wednesday, the University of Wisconsin paused its football activities because of an increased number of cases within the program.

Agents seize 100K counterfeit masks in Hong Kong,"Hong Kong customs agents seized 100,000 counterfeit face masks valued at nearly $400,000 in one of the largest raids of its kind on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported.

Agents located the personal protective equipment in a storehouse after they received a tip, which led to a 71-year-old trading company manager being arrested as the result of a further raid.

“Initial investigations revealed that unscrupulous merchants intended to transship the batch of masks overseas for sale and profit. Customs is looking into the source of the face masks involved in the case,” the government’s Information Services Department said in a news release, according to The Associated Press.

Customs agents launched operation ""Guardian"" in January, which led to spot checks of protective equipment including masks. Nearly 80 arrests have been made and almost 6 million face masks have been seized as a result of the operation, according to the AP.

China has been a source of a large amount of personal protective equipment such as masks, some of which has been found to be counterfeit or of poor quality.

As coronavirus cases continue to rise in the United States and more students return to schools, the need for personal protective equipment and masks increased. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) ended its funding for face coverings and masks within U.S. schools in September of this year.

Pelosi sent a letter to Mnuchin earlier in the day Thursday demanding a response to the Democrats’ latest offer on emergency coronavirus relief, and warned that a failure to act quickly will only worsen the health and economic fallout as the pandemic surges around the country.

“Your responses are critical for our negotiations to continue,"" Pelosi wrote to Mnuchin.

In his response, Mnuchin accused Pelosi of releasing the letter publicly as “a political stunt,” and claimed it inaccurately described the state of negotiations between the two.

Mnuchin further claimed that the administration accepted Pelosi’s proposal on dollars and language for coronavirus testing, and has provided feedback on the section on contact tracing.

He also said he’s worked with other agencies and committee chairs on responses on several areas of coronavirus relief, including rental assistance, small businesses and funding for the Postal Service.

“While you accuse the Administration of holding up negotiations, you refuse to bring to the floor of the House stand-alone legislation to support Airline workers, additional Paycheck Protection Program payments to small businesses, and additional Direct Payments that we can fund using already approved money that we have not spent,” Mnuchin wrote. “Your ALL OR NONE approach is hurting hard-working Americans who need help NOW.”

The letters are the latest squabble between the White House and Democratic congressional leadership on a coronavirus stimulus package that has been stalled for weeks.

The two sides have been in disagreement on a price tag for the deal and where money should be allotted. The White House has offered around $1.9 trillion, and Democrats have put up $2.2 trillion.

More than 4 percent of the conversation on Twitter about Harris was negative or circulated misinformation, while misinformation about Pence and Kaine made up for about 1 percent of talk on Twitter during the 2016 and 2020 elections, according to Zignal Labs.

There’s also been an uptick in the overall online conversation about vice presidential candidates in 2020 compared to four years ago, with a subsequent increase in misinformation or negative storylines spreading this year, based on the report.

The report found more than 280,000 mentions between July 1 and Oct. 9, making up around 1.2 percent of all mentions of Harris during that time period, regarding “birtherism” or that she was “not eligible” to serve as vice president.

The misinformation surrounding baseless claims that Harris, who was born in California, was not eligible to serve as vice president did not remain in the fringe Twitter sphere. This summer, a Newsweek column by John Eastman, a conservative attorney, called into question the citizen status of Harris's parents at the time of her birth. The article was then retweeted by Jenna Ellis, a Trump campaign adviser.

""I just heard that. I heard it today, that she doesn’t meet the requirements,"" the president said at a press conference in August. ""And by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, talented lawyer.""

Trump drew swift backlash from Democrats in office after he refused to disavow the racist conspiracy theory.

Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland. She is eligible to hold the office of vice president and would be the first woman of color to hold the position of vice president if Democrats oust Trump on Election Day.

Zignal Labs identified more than 1 million Twitter mentions since June featuring hashtags or misinformation regarding Harris. Some of the mentions were fact checks seeking to correct misinformation spread about Harris, though a majority were found to include false information about her.

“The narratives related to Kamala Harris zeroed in much more on her personal identity, especially as a woman of color,” Jennifer Granston, head of insights at Zignal Labs, told the AP.

Granston said much of the misinformation surrounding Harris's origin of birth ""eclipsed"" after media fact-checking organizations debunked the claims.

The nearly 300,000 mentions of Harris regarding birtherism made up just a portion of the more than 1 million tweets with misinformation, rumor or negative storylines in the July 1 to Oct. 9 timeframe, based on the report.

During the same time period, the report identified a total of 136,884 mentions of Pence with misinformation, rumors or negative storylines.

Riots and looting broke out in Philadelphia in recent days after Walter Wallace Jr., a 27-year-old Black man, was shot by police during a confrontation. Wallace’s family said he was going through a mental health crisis at the time of his death.

A local Walmart was among the stores looted in the city earlier this week, with news media finding loose ammo rounds on the floor at the ransacked location.

Walmart made a similar decision to remove firearms and ammo from its sales floors in June amid national unrest following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

Concerns about civil unrest have also risen nearing Election Day next week, with some political observers worried about a post-election backlash among the losing side given growing distrust about the fairness of the election.

Authorities in major cities say that law enforcement has prepared to respond to reports of voter harassment or intimidation as well as other potential election-related threats. Measures implemented due to the coronavirus pandemic have also raised the possibility of election results being delayed.

Walmart's move to take guns and ammo off its sales floors also comes as demand for firearms has risen dramatically this year, based on FBI background checks.

According to the Journal, the National Shooting Sports Foundation reported 12.1 million gun checks from January to July, 72 percent more than in the same time frame last year.

In the announcement Thursday, Walmart emphasized it sells firearms in only half of its locations and only in areas where there are large concentrations of ""hunters, sportsmen and sportswomen.""

Walmart stopped carrying semi-automatic rifles in 2015 and three years later raised its minimum age to purchase guns or ammunition to 21.

WHO: Europe again 'the epicenter' of coronavirus pandemic with 10 million cases,"The 53-country region that makes up Europe under the umbrella of the World Health Organization (WHO) said it reached a record of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 1.5 million new infections last week, the organization's European director said Thursday.

There have been more than 10 million confirmed cases since the pandemic began this year, according to The Associated Press.

“Europe is at the epicenter of this pandemic once again,” WHO European regional director Hans Kluge said in a meeting with European health ministers, according to AP. “At the risk of sounding alarmist, I must express our very real concern.”

Kluge said that deaths have increased by more than 30 percent in the past week and hospitalizations have reached their highest levels since spring, AP reported.

“Test positivity levels have reached new highs,” Kluge said, explaining that testing systems have been unable to keep up with the influx.

In additional to what is typically considered part of Europe, the WHO's European division includes Russia as well as central Asian countries like Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan in its 53-country count, according to AP.

Despite the increase in cases, Kluge said nationwide lockdowns should be viewed as a last resort. He cited the economic toll and effects on mental health as his reasoning behind keeping countries open.

Several European countries have begun to take restrictive measures to curb the spread of the virus including Germany, Ireland and France, which have all implemented shutdowns.

Kluge warned last month that increases in infections even faster than they were in March should ""serve as a wake-up call.”",2020-10-29 17:21:29-04:00,

GOP faces fundraising reckoning as Democrats rake in cash,"Republicans are facing a post-election reckoning about how they cultivate small-dollar donors.

Regardless of who wins on Nov. 3, GOP lawmakers and officials say there needs to be a party-wide discussion about how to better fundraise as the coronavirus pandemic magnifies the importance of digital efforts at a time when in-person events are dramatically scaled back.

Republicans, playing defense as they try to hold on to the Senate majority and the White House, have watched Democrats rake in a mountain of cash that has helped move deep-red states into toss-up territory and set off alarms throughout the GOP.

“They’ve created a mechanism that’s very effective, and we’re trying to catch up,” Thune said, noting Republicans “were just getting crushed.”

Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonSunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day Georgia Republican Drew Ferguson tests positive for COVID-19 GOP faces fundraising reckoning as Democrats rake in cash MORE (R-Wis.), who is up for reelection in 2022, called it an “obvious yes.”

“I think Democrats with ActBlue are way ahead. ... Hats off to them, they did a really good job. We’re just behind,” Johnson said, referring to the main fundraising platform for donations to Democratic candidates and causes.

The looming GOP introspection on fundraising comes as the party’s Senate candidates in the most competitive races have been outspent and outraised by their Democratic counterparts, allowing them to put Republican senators, whose reelections were once considered sure bets, on the defense.

""It pays dividends down the road. I think that you will absolutely see people raising the spending disparities as something that affected the outcome in certain races and highlighting it as something that needs to improve on our side for the next cycle,"" said one GOP official.

That cash advantage includes states that were expected to be competitive at the start of the cycle, including Arizona and Maine. But Democrats have been able to galvanize a national network of grass-roots donors through ActBlue to pour money into once-safe red seats.

Amy McGrath, the Democratic Senate nominee in Kentucky, has brought in roughly $88 million; Barbara Bollier, who is running for an open Senate seat in Kansas, has raised more than $24.4 million; and Jaime Harrison, who is challenging Sen.

Graham argued that “me breathing” was enough to anger Democrats and fuel donations toward Harrison, but he acknowledged that Republicans have to be competitive in the digital space.

“Traditional fundraising is still there, but the social media ... my opponent, to his credit, it’s just been incredible what ActBlue has been able to do,” Graham said. “If you don’t have a social media fundraising strategy, you’re in trouble.”

Democrats have shown they can seize on major and unexpected political moments, like the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Ruth Bader GinsburgThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law Ginsburg's granddaughter cuts election ad for progressive group: 'Make her voice heard at the ballot box' The truth, the whole truth about protecting preexisting conditions MORE and the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett Amy Coney BarrettThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law If it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Pittsburgh newspaper backs Trump in first GOP presidential endorsement since 1972 MORE to replace her, as force multipliers for the party’s fundraising apparatus.

“Democratic Senate campaigns made strategic early investments in digital infrastructure from the day they launched, and those smart decisions have paid off and helped expand the map. But the problem for Republican incumbents isn’t just that they’re behind on the tools to use, they’re also facing a massive grass-roots enthusiasm gap this cycle,” said Stewart Boss, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Jessica Taylor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report noted in a final pre-election analysis that “if Democrats take back the Senate ... the fundraising advantage challengers built early on, largely enabled by grass-roots small-dollar donors, will also play a large part in that victory.”

That set off behind-the-scenes alarm bells among Republicans.

GOP officials have been privately warning Senate staff and campaigns for months that if they didn’t step up their own online fundraising game they were going to face a “green tsunami” of Democratic cash in the closing months.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.) warned GOP lobbyists in a recent phone call that Democrats were “on fire” with their fundraising, sources told CNN, urging donors to help close the funding gap.

Republicans started WinRed in mid-2019 as an effort to counteract ActBlue, which launched 15 years earlier.

ActBlue brought in $1.5 billion in the latest fundraising quarter, compared to about $620 million for WinRed. GOP officials note ActBlue is also open to nonprofit and social welfare organizations, whereas WinRed is focused on candidates and party committees.

“At the moment it’s not apples-to-apples. ... On a federal-to-federal comparison we are actually quite close, and I think October might surprise some people. I think it sort of depends on November, how much money gets raised in 2022,” said Gerrit Lansing, WinRed’s president.

“I think, regardless, we're going to surprise a lot of people next cycle with what we’re able to put up against ActBlue on an apples-to-apples comparison,” he added.

Johnson predicted that Republicans would find their footing with time.

“Any successful business follows what their successful competitors do, so we’re just behind the curb,” Johnson said about 2022. “I know we’ll try and develop that further.”

Even as Democrats have an advantage on small-dollar donors, Republican super PACs have poured in money in the final stretch.

The Senate Leadership Fund, which is run by McConnell allies, raised nearly $50 million in the first two weeks of October and spent more than $94 million in the same time period, with additional spending in states like Alaska, Kansas, North Carolina and South Carolina since then, according to Federal Election Commission filings, as they try to shore up GOP incumbents.

Senate Republicans argued that the eventual shift needs to go beyond only creating an account on WinRed, which they credited with success in its short lifespan, but to the mindset of individual campaigns to prioritize digital outreach to small-dollar donors.

“Yes, the WinRed thing has just been active for a short period of time, but it’s clear that Democrats ... have figured this out better than we have. And I think rather than dinners and cocktail receptions and things like that they’re just relying on contributions on the internet. And it’s working for them because they’re basically outspending all the rest of us,” Cornyn said.

Thune added there needed to be a “larger conversation” about how to galvanize small-dollar donors.

""Just building a real online presence. ... It’s like the old-school days when you prospected through the mail. You expected to lose money early on but you would add names and then over time, as it builds up, then it becomes really financially sustainable,” Thune said.

Part of the challenge for Republicans will be to condition their supporters to turn frustration over news-of-the-day stories or significant political developments into a built-in reaction to donate. Democrats, for example, were able to raise $100 million in roughly 36 hours after Ginsburg’s death in part, Republicans argue, because they have more than 15 years of building a culture that emphasizes donating.

Lansing said that while Republicans had “come a really long way,” getting GOP voters conditioned was still “one of the big macro problems.”

“I think that’s one of the big macro problems. Look, ActBlue has been around for 15 years,” he said. “They’ve had 15 years to sort of train the audience, so to speak, and we’ve had like 15-plus months.”",2020-10-30 06:00:27-04:00,

Senate lawmakers and aides say McConnell (R-Ky.) and Pelosi, both longtime members of the Senate and House appropriations committees, have strong incentive to get a coronavirus relief deal done in the lame-duck session because it will make it easier to put together a full-year annual appropriations package before Christmas.

Pelosi is no longer a member of the House Appropriations Committee but is seen as sympathetic to the panel’s goals.

Capito said it would “definitely be the preferable” course to have a stimulus package done before the year-end spending bills are due. She spoke to The Hill shortly after the Senate recessed for the election.

A senior Senate GOP aide predicted a deal is likely in the lame-duck because Senate Republicans will be less worried about angering their base by agreeing to Democratic priorities, such as infusion of aid for state and local governments, and Democrats will be less motivated to deny Trump a legislative victory and credit for boosting the economy.

“Pelosi and Schumer didn’t want to cut a deal before the election. After the election and after McConnell is reelected as leader there is more opportunity,” said the aide.

“It’s not easy because of the way Pelosi is negotiating,” the GOP aide said, criticizing the House Speaker. “But if she’s open to a conversation about what is realistic and possible, then anything is possible.”

Some have questioned whether a lame-duck Trump, if he loses the election, would be interested in dealing.

The GOP aide predicted that Trump, if he loses, is “going to be looking at historical legacy” and is “going to want to be able to say these are my vaccines,” referring to money that would go to deploying health care initiatives.

Pelosi on Thursday told Bloomberg News’s “Balance of Power” that she thinks there’s a realistic chance of a deal in the lame-duck.

“The president has said we would have an agreement after the election,” she noted.

Pelosi sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, the lead White House negotiator, Thursday asking for a response to the latest compromise offer she made earlier this month.

“Your responses are critical for our negotiations to continue,” she wrote. “The president’s words that ‘after the election, we will get the best stimulus package you have ever seen’ only have meaning if he can get Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE to take his hand off the pause button and get Senate Republican Chairmen moving toward agreement with their House counterparts.""

Some Democrats, however, are skeptical that McConnell will agree to any deal if Trump loses the White House.

“Something should be done. Something should have been done already,” said a Senate Democratic aide who predicted that Republicans will be in no mood to compromise if they lose the presidency and the Senate.

“I don’t think there is a package, period, if they lose. I think Pelosi wants one,” the source added, predicting that GOP lawmakers will again embrace fiscal austerity as they did under President Obama 10 years ago.

Last month, Schumer slammed Trump’s views on the global climate as idiotic.

“President Trump suggested idiotically that the planet will start getting cooler, just you watch. Sound familiar? This is like COVID’s a hoax and will go away when the weather gets warmer. This man has no knowledge about anything and yet he just spouts,” Schumer said at a press conference.

“I think Michigan’s an opportunity that people are at least somewhat aware of. John James has done a great job of raising money, and I think if he can turn out voters in the city, he’ll do well out-state. He’s got a good shot,” Thune said.

A New York Times-Siena College poll published Wednesday showed Peters ahead of James by 8 percentage points, the same margin as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s lead over President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE in the state.

Other polls have shown a tighter Senate race.

An ABC News-Washington Post poll conducted Oct. 20-25 and a Reuters-Ipsos poll from Oct. 21-27 both showed Peters ahead by 6 points.

Democrats in Washington have also pumped money into the contest.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the Michigan Senate race “lean Democratic.”

For the Minnesota race, Cook rates it as “solid Democratic.”

But for Thune, the Minnesota race is a “sleeper” that’s ripe for a GOP upset.

“I think that people are looking at the security issues if you live in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs,” he said, referring to the belief among Republicans that Trump’s law-and-order message will play well with suburban voters concerned about the rioting and looting in the city after the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis in late May.

“You get to the rural areas and it’s real strong for the Republicans,” Thune added. “There’s always going to be a couple of surprises election night.”

Minnesota is more of a reach for Republicans, but the race between Smith and Republican Jason Lewis Jason Mark LewisKlobuchar 'feeling good' about Democrats taking control of Senate The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Trump, Biden blitz battleground states GOP sees path to hold Senate majority MORE got fresh attention after a KSTP-SurveyUSA poll last week showed a statistical tie between the two candidates, at 43 percent to 42 percent in Smith's favor.

“The race is tightening in Minnesota. It’s close, but the Democrats are probably ahead,” said Vin Weber, a Republican strategist and former member of Congress from Minnesota who suggested Lewis’s focus on crime in Minneapolis is getting traction with voters.

Senate Democratic strategists, however, argue that Republican-allied groups haven’t spent significant amounts of money in their effort to defeat Smith.

Paul Goren, a professor of political science at the University of Minnesota, said that while the KSTP-SurveyUSA poll’s “methodology is sound,” it’s an “outlier” compared to other surveys that show Smith with bigger leads.

“I think Smith is still in the driver’s seat and should feel cautiously optimistic about the outcome, but it’s by no means a guarantee or a sure thing,” he said.

One Senate Democratic strategist pushed back hard on Republican hopes for an upset victory in the Michigan or Minnesota Senate races, noting that Trump is widely expected to lose both states.

In other parts of the country, Thune said he has been reassured by some traditionally Republican states starting to perform more along the lines of what GOP senators expected at the start of the 2020 election cycle.

“Some of these states have started to right themselves. Montana, for example, I feel really good about. The Daines campaign is there,” he said referring to Sen.

“The numbers have started to strengthen and improve with some of our incumbents,” Thune added.

“Susan Collins is going to run a long ways ahead of the presidential ballot in Maine. She may be able to get enough distance and space between herself and [Trump],” Thune said.

A second Republican senator who requested anonymity to discuss views within the Senate GOP caucus of keeping their majority said he and many of his colleagues remain hopeful because experts and pollsters widely predicted Trump’s defeat in 2016 and were wrong.

Republicans in Congress faced more blame than the president in the poll when voters were given the option to choose between the two. Twenty-five percent of those surveyed blamed congressional Republicans, while 19 percent said that Trump was directly at fault for talks collapsing.

The rancorous nature of their relationship was on full display Monday evening, moments before the Senate voted to confirm Barrett along party lines, when Schumer declared it would “go down as one of the darkest days in the 231-year history of the Senate.”

The deterioration of their relationship in recent months, a tense election year when control of the Senate in 2021 is at stake, raises questions about their ability to work together in the future and whether Democrats will change the chamber’s rules once in power to circumvent McConnell entirely.

A growing number of Democrats are pushing for Schumer to eliminate the legislative filibuster if they win the Senate majority.

Schumer on Monday slammed McConnell personally, accusing him of hypocrisy and lying. He also offered a chilling warning of what Republicans might expect if Democrats win back control of the Senate on Nov. 3.

“The next time the American people give Democrats a majority in this chamber, you will have forfeited the right to tell us how to run that majority,” he said. “I know you think that this will eventually blow over. But you are wrong.”

“My colleagues may regret this for a lot longer than they think,” he later added.

When it was McConnell’s turn to speak, instead of basking in the glow of a major Republican victory, he spent much of his speech laying into Schumer.

The GOP leader dismissed Schumer’s allegations of impropriety as “outlandish” and “utterly absurd.”

He also got down to a personal level, accusing Schumer of threatening conservative justices on the court.

Schumer, walking out of the Senate after the vote Monday evening, told reporters: “I have two words for McConnell’s speech: very defensive.”

And when McConnell then announced last month that he was going to speed Barrett’s nomination through the Senate less than a month before Election Day, it outraged Democrats.

McConnell has tried to draw a distinction between 2016 and 2020 by pointing out that the White House and Senate were split between the parties four years ago and now both are unified under Republican control. The explanation did nothing to soothe furious Democrats.

However, the tension between the two leaders was clear to see even before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Ruth Bader GinsburgThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law Ginsburg's granddaughter cuts election ad for progressive group: 'Make her voice heard at the ballot box' The truth, the whole truth about protecting preexisting conditions MORE’s death and the battle over her seat.

Before the pandemic, Schumer and McConnell fought bitterly over the rules for Trump’s impeachment trial. The Democratic leader blasted it as “a sham,” “a perfidy” and “one of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome” after McConnell and most of his conference refused to allow additional witnesses.

The episode showed how much the relationship between the Senate’s top leaders had eroded since President Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999, when then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Democratic Leader Tom Daschle (S.D.) were able to hammer out an impeachment resolution that passed the chamber unanimously.

This year, McConnell didn’t reach out to Schumer to attempt to negotiate a bipartisan resolution. He also left his counterpart in the dark for weeks in April about his plans to negotiate another coronavirus relief package.

“Look, I try to get along with everybody and — but he’s not very talkative, let’s put it like that,” Schumer said during an appearance at the time on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Stephen Tyrone ColbertColbert says Trump is why he doesn't play satirical conservative character anymore McConnell and Schumer's relationship shredded after court brawl Late-night hosts targeted Trump over Biden 97 percent of the time in September: study MORE.”

During his recent debate with Democrat Amy McGrath, McConnell reminded viewers that if he lost his reelection bid, the leader of the upper chamber would be from New York — not Kentucky.

Both leaders have also weaponized the Senate’s procedures in recent weeks.

Democrats invoked the Senate’s two-hour rule to prevent the Republican-run committees from holding hearings after the Senate had been in session for more than two hours and Schumer forced multiple votes on motions to adjourn.

McConnell slammed Schumer over his tactics last week.

“The Democratic leader is just lashing out in random ways,” he said, citing Schumer blocking an intelligence briefing “for no reason” and trying “repeatedly to adjourn the Senate for multiple weeks.”

“I understand that some outside pressure groups have been badgering the Democratic leader to act more angry. I’m just sorry for the Senate that he obeys them,” McConnell said on the floor.

“Scolding somebody for being too civil?” McConnell asked incredulously. “I’m sorry that he feels the need to constantly say things that are false.”

Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, said when Schumer took over as Democratic leader at the start of 2017, there was hope that his relationship with McConnell would be better than that of his predecessor, former Sen.

Baker, who served three fellowships with Reid, said the former Nevada lawmaker, who was the Senate majority leader when McConnell became the GOP leader in 2007, at first saw his Republican counterpart as a “friendly adversary.” But the relationship deteriorated dramatically over the next 10 years.

Schumer traveled to the University of Louisville in February 2018 to appear with McConnell as part of the McConnell Center Distinguished Speaker Series. Two years later, it’s hard to imagine Schumer making such a gesture of collegiality.

Jim Manley, a former aide to Reid, said Schumer’s relationship with McConnell is falling apart at about the same time Reid’s did, around the four-year mark of working together.

“Schumer has found out exactly what Reid did, which is that it’s impossible to do business with the guy,” he said. “As far as I can tell, the relationship between the two is as broken as it was between Reid and McConnell.”

“What’s going on is yet another indication of how broken the Senate has become,” he added.

Brian Darling, a former Senate GOP aide, said “it was more of a clubby atmosphere” when McConnell and Schumer were first elected to the Senate in 1984 and 1998, respectively, but those days are “over and not coming back anytime soon.”

He added that McConnell and Schumer both are prolific fundraisers who are driven to win and who closely manage their respective caucuses’ political strategies, which makes for an intensely competitive atmosphere.

“They’re both looking over their shoulders at conservatives and liberals in their own caucuses who are pushing for them to dig in and be more partisan,” Darling added.",2020-10-28 06:00:21-04:00,

The long-simmering debate over the seismic changes is gaining new steam amid deep frustrations about the state of the Senate, which has been battered by a slew of explosive fights in recent years that have ratcheted tensions to an all time-high.

Supporters of adding court seats and eliminating the filibuster argue that Barrett’s confirmation fight — which came four years after Republicans refused to give Judge Merrick Garland Merrick Brian GarlandWhat a Biden administration should look like McConnell and Schumer's relationship shredded after court brawl Bitter fight over Barrett fuels calls to nix filibuster, expand court MORE a hearing or a vote — lays the groundwork for Democrats to enact rules and structural changes.

“We’re not getting anything done if the legislative filibuster is in place. It has to go, it should go on day one,” said Meagan Hatcher-Mays, the director of democracy policy at Indivisible. “We are thinking of this fight — for the courts and the fight for our democracy — as two parts of the same fight.”

Progressives in both the House and Senate have doubled down on their calls for Democrats to expand the court after Barrett’s confirmation.

Democrats have been careful not to say what they will do if they are in the majority next year, arguing that with the election looming, the discussion isn’t yet ripe. But they warned that the fight over Barrett’s nomination is making them rethink how the Senate functions as an institution.

“Democrats are going to have to wrap their mind around what has happened, because we can’t be the only ones showing any restraint. Right, because that’s just a recipe for getting rolled and rolled and rolled, and that's a recipe for entrenching minority rule. ... So something has to give,” said Sen.

But Barrett’s confirmation dropped a bomb into an ongoing debate among Democrats about how big they should go next year if they have control of both Congress and the White House.

Supporters of nixing the 60-vote legislative filibuster argue it stands in the way of some of the biggest priorities for Democrats, including health care, voting rights, climate change and potentially even another round of coronavirus relief.

Eliminating the filibuster is also at the heart of the debate over expanding the Supreme Court, which would require passing legislation through both chambers and getting a signature from the president.

Democrats would need 50 votes in the Senate to go “nuclear” and lower the legislative filibuster without GOP support. If it remains intact, Democrats would need to win over several Republican senators to round up the 60 votes needed to pass most legislation.

Democratic leadership hasn’t ruled anything in or out if they control the Senate next year as they try to keep their caucus unified ahead of the November election.

But Schumer warned that Republicans have lost their right to kvetch about how Democrats might run the chamber.

“The next time the American people give Democrats a majority in this chamber, you will have forfeited the right to tell us how to run that majority,"" Schumer said.

It’s unclear if Democrats will have the necessary votes, and a razor thin margin could complicate their strategy. When Democrats nixed the filibuster for certain nominees in 2013, the party had a 55-45 majority. By comparison, FiveThirtyEight estimates that a 51-49 Democratic majority is the most likely outcome for 2021.

“We’ve got to have a wide open conversation about: How do we rebalance our courts?” Coons said during a recent interview with MSNBC. “We’ve got to look at our federal courts as a whole.”

At the same time, Trump targeted Pelosi, claiming the top Democrat was seeking “bailouts” for states and cities run by Democrats and predicting boldly that the failed negotiations would cost Democrats the House majority.

“Nancy Pelosi is only interested in bailing out badly-run, crime-ridden Democrat cities and states. That’s all she is interested in,” Trump said. “She is not interested in helping the people.”

“After the election, we will get the best stimulus package you have ever seen,” Trump continued. “I think we are going to take back the House because of her.”

It is highly unlikely that Republicans will take back the House, which has been under Democratic control since the 2018 midterm elections. The Cook Political Report predicts that Democrats will expand their majority in 2020. Pelosi called Trump “delusional” after he made the same prediction last week during the final presidential debate.

The coronavirus pandemic and related business closures devastated the U.S. economy, resulting in millions of job losses earlier this year. The country has seen four consecutive months of job gains, causing the unemployment rate to fall to 7.9 percent in September, but the data has evidenced a slowing recovery and economists have expressed concerns about the state of the economy without further fiscal support.

The White House and Democrats have negotiated for months on another round of stimulus without a deal, and it appeared increasingly unlikely both sides would not come to an agreement before Nov. 3 even before Trump’s remarks on Tuesday afternoon.

Speaking on Fox News earlier Tuesday, White House communications director Alyssa Farah said the White House hoped to reach a deal with Democrats on further coronavirus relief that could be voted on “within weeks.”

What’s more, some Senate Republicans have opposed the White House’s $1.8 trillion price tag in negotiations with Democrats and it is not clear whether a bipartisan stimulus deal would be able to pass the upper chamber even if the White House and Democrats were to reach an agreement.

Despite Trump’s optimism, it is unclear whether the two sides will be able to reach an agreement following the election, either. The prospects for a deal will undoubtedly depend on who wins the White House and whether the GOP retains control of the Senate.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report made its final House forecast Monday, a day before the Nov. 3 elections, indicating that a combination of factors — from the Democrats' sharp fundraising advantage, to dozens of Republican retirements, to President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE's unpopularity, particularly in the suburbs — leaves Democrats poised to pad their majority in the next Congress.

""After impeachment and a Supreme Court fight (that wasn't much of one) and amid a global pandemic and racial reckoning, many congressional candidates have struggled to control their own destiny,"" David Wasserman, Cook's top House analyst, wrote in announcing the changes. ""But the House battlefield has steadily moved towards Democrats all cycle.""

Yet another Republican from the Lone Star State, Rep. John Carter John Rice CarterBiden, Democrats see late opportunity in Texas Donna Imam wins Democratic runoff to face Rep. John Carter House panel advances bill banning construction on bases with Confederate names MORE, is also facing tougher headwinds, according to Cook's analysis, which shifts the nine-term lawmaker into the ""leans"" Republican column. Carter had previously been deemed the ""likely"" victor.

Cook predicts that two sitting Democrats thought to be vulnerable are now on much firmer footing. Reps. Andy Kim (N.J.) and Conor Lamb (Pa.), two more suburban lawmakers, had previously been in the ""lean Democrat"" category. Now they're both considered ""likely"" to return to Washington next year.

In its final shift, Cook also forecasts that two incumbent Democrats are now virtually shoo-ins to win reelection: Reps Josh Gottheimer Joshua (Josh) GottheimerLawmakers hope election releases pressure on stimulus talks Trump fuels and frustrates COVID-19 relief talks Trump's illness sparks new urgency for COVID-19 deal MORE (N.J.) and Sean Patrick Maloney (N.Y.) are now considered ""solid"" Democratic seats, a change from their ""likely"" designation beforehand.

But some key Democrats and House committees are already planning — and pressing party leaders — to keep digging into open investigations.

“There are legitimate questions that have to be answered about what took place, whether there is ongoing criminal activity,” said Rep. Mike Quigley Michael (Mike) Bruce QuigleyWomack to replace Graves on Financial Services subcommittee Preventing next pandemic requires new bill's global solutions Democrats introduce legislation to revise FDA requirements for LGBT blood donors MORE (D-Ill.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. “That is fair game, no matter how you look at this.”

The Intelligence panel plans to pursue its investigation into the potential politicization of intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security, a probe Democrats say was obstructed by the Trump administration, according to a committee aide.

Rep. Carolyn Maloney Carolyn Bosher MaloneyTop Interior official retaliated against whistleblower, watchdog says Documents show 'political' nature of Trump COVID ad campaign, lawmakers say Trump, House lawyers return to court in fight over subpoena for financial records MORE (D-N.Y.), the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said that while the top priority will be on fighting the pandemic and helping the economy recover, her panel’s Trump-related investigations will move forward.

“As the Committee looks to continue working on behalf of all Americans in the 117th Congress, we will prioritize our investigation into skyrocketing drug prices, restoring the U.S. Postal Service, and ensuring that the census is accurate and complete,” Maloney said in a statement to The Hill.

In a sign that Democrats don’t plan to take their foot off the gas, Maloney on Friday notified Mark Morgan, the top official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that she would be subpoenaing him for records with a Nov. 13 deadline, just 10 days after the elections.

“After the Trump Administration ends, it will be crucial to take full stock of the damage that’s been done and determine what legislative remedies are needed to protect our agencies going forward from the sort of abuses we’ve seen under Secretary Pompeo, Michael Pack, and others,” the aide said in a statement to The Hill.

But it is unclear whether Democrats will charge ahead with their existing probes or ease off their investigative powers, particularly as Biden has campaigned on a message of uniting a divided country.

Pelosi is expected to be intimately involved in whatever strategy Democrats pursue, with some Democrats saying she will likely gauge the temperature of the public, the caucus and Biden, if he’s in the Oval Office, before deciding how to proceed.

A spokesman for Pelosi did not respond to The Hill’s request for comment.

“I suspect this is going to be very much a case-by-case decisionmaking about what to do,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin Jamin (Jamie) Ben RaskinCongress must repeal tax breaks for the wealthy passed in CARES Act COVID-19 and the problem of presidential succession Warren, Porter to headline progressive fundraiser supporting seven swing state candidates MORE (D-Md.), a member of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees.

Another question is how far back Democrats will want to go in Trump’s presidency, including a possible push for information the White House withheld during the House’s 2019 impeachment inquiry.

Democrats acknowledge they will need to strike a balance of not appearing vindictive while conducting what they say is legitimate congressional oversight.

“I suspect some of it has to do with whether we are needing to legislate to repair the damage of particular scandals and corruption,” said Raskin. “There will be a role, undoubtedly, for completing investigations that help us figure out how to prevent various transgressions from repeating themselves.”

Some Democrats are eager to reassert Congress’s authority by going after individuals who defied subpoenas.

“It is really important that we dedicate time to hold accountable those who showed contempt to Congress,” said Rep. Jim Himes James (Jim) Andres HimesHouse Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education Overnight Defense: Pentagon IG to audit use of COVID-19 funds on contractors | Dems optimistic on blocking Trump's Germany withdrawal | Obama slams Trump on foreign policy House panel urges intelligence community to step up science and technology efforts MORE (D-Conn.), a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee.

Himes advocated for prosecuting individuals who clearly violated the law while acknowledging that Democrats need to be careful not to “overstep” and “be mindful” of efforts to unify the country, signaling the fine line Democrats will need to walk next year.

Other Democrats shared Himes’s view, with some jokingly noting that perhaps Republicans will come to agree with them about the need to enforce subpoenas if Biden is in the White House instead of Trump.

If the elections lead to a blue sweep — control of both chambers and the White House — Democrats will not only be rushing to fulfill legislative priorities, they’ll also be keen on closing loopholes they say were abused by Trump officials.

Democrats have already expressed a desire to pass a host of specific proposals: strengthening the Emoluments Clause and the Hatch Act; compelling presidential candidates to release their tax returns; boosting protections for whistleblowers; and affirming the independence of inspectors general from political pressure.

“We clearly need a new procedure to stop presidents from exploiting their office for private gain,” said Raskin of the Emoluments Clause, pointing to reports of Trump pocketing money from foreign governments. “I would say that investigation should continue and expand, but with an eye towards preventing the Trump model from repeating itself.”

Quigley said Democrats are also interested in overhauling rules for prosecuting presidents. In particular, he said if a president commits a crime in their first term, the statute of limitations — currently five years — all but precludes prosecution after a second term.

“If you follow the [Department of Justice] notion that they serve a second term, they are exempt from prosecution — eight years,” he told The Hill. “That's the kind of thing we have to capture. There should be a whole packet on this, as there was post-Watergate. The best way to describe this is: The Constitution wasn't written with this president in mind.”

Some Democrats have suggested that if their party wins control of both Congress and the White House, the energy on Capitol Hill will be more focused on fulfilling an ambitious legislative agenda that includes tackling COVID-19, climate change, infrastructure and a host of other issues, making it harder to keep the political pressure on pursuing Trump investigations.

Other Democratic lawmakers have indicated they don’t want to fall into a trap of endless probes, fearing that doing so would alienate voters and counter the message of national healing that Biden is seeking to project.

At the same time, there is a loud contingent of Democrats who argue that the president is not above the law and he should be held accountable, even if that means pursuing investigations into a previous administration.

“Congress has a responsibility to conduct oversight, and we cannot allow the precedent that illegal acts when committed by a president or others in the administration will be tolerated,” said Rep.

Democrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts,"Most of the 30 Democrats representing swing districts that President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE carried in 2016 are favored to win reelection, marking the latest sign that the party is likely to expand its House majority.

It's a change of fortunes from late last year, when those same Democrats faced a tough decision on whether to impeach Trump and risk alienating split-ticket voters.

But since then, Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has weighed on Republicans down the ballot and allowed Democrats to expand their map of targets for Election Day.

That forced Republicans to divert resources and play defense in what had once been GOP strongholds, while Democrats are positioned to run up the score.

“It's difficult to overstate just how much the map shifted as the environment deteriorated,” a senior House Republican strategist said.

Only eight of the 30 districts held by Democrats where Trump won four years ago are considered ""toss-ups"" by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, while others are considered leaning or likely going toward Democrats.

Among the most vulnerable Democrats are Reps. Collin Peterson Collin Clark PetersonTrump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Democrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority MORE (Minn.), the House Agriculture Committee chairman who’s managed to hang on to his seat since 1991 despite Trump winning his district by 30 points, and several first-term lawmakers who flipped GOP seats in 2018: Reps.

One factor making it easier for front-line House Democrats is their vast cash advantage over their Republican challengers.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has outraised its GOP counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, by $60 million this cycle. And many House Democratic incumbents are raising eye-popping sums compared with the Republicans looking to unseat them.

Brindisi, for example, has raised around $5 million, while his Republican opponent, Claudia Tenney, has brought in just $2 million in an upstate New York district where Trump won by 15 points.

And in Oklahoma’s 5th District, where Trump won by 13 points, Horn has raised about $5 million to Republican challenger Stephanie Bice’s $3 million.

Democrats in those swing districts won in 2018 by focusing on health care after Republicans failed to pass a replacement for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) when they controlled both chambers of Congress, despite repeatedly pledging and campaigning over the years to repeal the 2010 law also known as ObamaCare.

Health care remains front and center this time around in a pandemic that has resulted in the deaths of 229,000 people in the U.S. and with the Supreme Court expected to hear oral arguments next week in a Republican-led case that aims to overturn the ACA in its entirety.

“House Democrats flipped Trump districts by promising to protect Americans’ health care. They’ll keep those seats because they followed through on that promise,” DCCC spokesperson Robyn Patterson said. “Our most vulnerable members built strong local brands, raised record amounts of money, and are out performing the national environment because of their work to protect their constituents’ health care during a deadly pandemic.”

With the COVID-19 pandemic at the top of voters’ minds, especially as the U.S. hits record highs for new cases, the House votes to impeach Trump nearly a year ago are a distant memory despite the heartburn it gave vulnerable Democrats at the time.

Peterson was the only Democrat to vote against both articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abuse of power in his dealings with the Ukrainian government and obstruction of Congress for refusing to cooperate in the investigation. The Minnesota lawmaker declared at the time that the process was a “mistake” and pledged that “I will not be whipped in line by my party.”

Golden voted in favor of the article of impeachment accusing Trump of abusing his power but opposed the second article alleging that the president obstructed Congress.

Peterson remains in a tight race against former Minnesota Lt. Gov. Michelle Fischbach (R), but Golden is favored to win reelection.

House Democratic leaders are openly predicting they will pick up seats on Election Day, with estimates ranging from a five to 15 net gain.

“Our hope is to keep it in the single digits,” the strategist said. “If it's a good night, then it may be basically a minimal net gain for Democrats.”",2020-11-01 10:30:07-05:00,

Democrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history',"House Democrats on the committee overseeing the coronavirus crisis released a report Friday calling the Trump administration’s response “among the worst failures of leadership in American history.”

The report from the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis comes four days before Election Day, in a campaign where Democrats have hammered President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE over his response to a virus that has killed more than 228,000 people in the U.S.

“President Trump’s decision to mislead the public about the severity of the crisis, his failure to listen to scientists about how to keep Americans healthy, and his refusal to implement a coordinated national plan to stop the coronavirus have all contributed to devastating results: more than 227,000 Americans dead, more than 8.8 million Americans infected, and a dangerous virus that continues to spread out of control nine months after it reached our nation’s shores,” the report said.

ADVERTISEMENT

The report pointed to the administration’s failure to “implement a national plan on testing, contact tracing, public health measures, and protective equipment,” instead shifting much responsibility to the states that were competing with each other for testing supplies and protective equipment early on in the pandemic.

The White House’s own findings that it sent to states, but did not release to the public, have shown the number of “red zone” states increasing from seven on June 23 to 31 on Oct. 18, the committee found, in contrast to Trump’s continued public downplaying of the severity of the virus.

The committee report also highlighted instances of the administration having “injected politics into public health decisions,” such as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August that said asymptomatic people do not need to be tested, which eventually was walked back somewhat amid a firestorm.

On the economic side, the committee said 9 million Americans were still waiting as of September to receive their $1,200 checks that Congress authorized in the CARES Act more than six months earlier.

Republicans dismissed the report as political posturing ahead of the elections.

Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress have outlined ambitious legislative plans for next year, including efforts to bolster the nation's infrastructure, lower prescription drug costs, tackle climate change and reform the campaign finance system.

Confident in a Biden victory, Pelosi said she wants to help jumpstart that agenda by moving another massive coronavirus package before year's end.

Pelosi warned Thursday that she won't accept ""a small bill"" that lends huge tax cuts to the wealthy, as included in the CARES Act, without providing a good dose of help for struggling families, small businesses, health care providers and unemployed workers. Pelosi has held firm to her demand for a $2.2 trillion package, while the White House has come as high as $1.9 trillion.

The Speaker also took a shot at the president for taking a victory lap following a historic economic rebound in the third quarter. Noting that the boost did not compensate for losses earlier in the year, she said it was federal stimulus spending, not Trump's agenda, that spurred the recovery.

""The Cares Act deserves credit for that,"" she said.

Pelosi noted that nearly 1 million women — 865,000, according to government figures — left the workforce in September. That's four times the number of men, 216,000, who also dropped out of the workforce last month.

The letter arrives just five days before Election Day, with both parties seeking to blame the other for the stalemate that has prevented an agreement on another multitrillion-dollar infusion of emergency funding to prop up struggling states, businesses, families and health care providers.

A Morning Consult poll released earlier this week found Americans blame Republicans and President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE slightly more than Pelosi and the Democrats for not being able to strike a deal. Independent voters surveyed blamed the GOP, 43 percent to 34 percent.

Pelosi and Mnuchin had been in exhaustive talks through September and much of October in search of an elusive bipartisan deal that could pass through both chambers of Congress and win Trump's signature. But the sides were in disagreement over both the size of the package — the White House had offered roughly $1.9 trillion, while Democrats sought $2.2 trillion — and specific language dictating how the money would be spent.

As the impasse grew longer, Trump, who had initially urged Congress to vote on another aid package before Election Day, shifted tactics, vowing to resume negotiations only in the lame-duck session.

“After the election, we’ll get the best stimulus package you’ve ever seen,” the president said Tuesday.

But Congress is already facing a Dec. 11 deadline to fund the government and prevent a shutdown, legislation that will consume much of the post-election oxygen on Capitol Hill. And given the uncertainty of the election results, many lawmakers are dubious that the feuding parties will be able to put aside differences and unite behind another massive stimulus bill before 2021.

Both Senate Republicans and White House officials have accused Pelosi of not agreeing to their demands in an attempt to prevent handing president a political victory before the election.

“Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do,” Trump said during last week's presidential debate when asked about a lack of stimulus deal from Congress. “It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.""

The breakdown in the talks has come at a volatile time for the Congress and the country, as millions of workers remain unemployed, the stock market has plunged and the number of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths is spiking around the country.

Pelosi's letter highlighted the grim numbers: Coronavirus cases are approaching 9 million, fatalities are nearing 250,000, roughly 8 million people have fallen into poverty since May and millions more kids are facing food insecurity than before the pandemic hit.

""Meanwhile, as the coronavirus surges and the stock market plummets, we are still awaiting the Trump Administration’s promised responses on multiple items of critical importance,"" she wrote.

Pelosi's latest offer sought concessions from the administration on a number of outstanding issues, including the development of a national coronavirus testing strategy, health coverage for jobless workers under ObamaCare, a tax credit for low-income families and funding for schools, child care and unemployment benefits.

There are also remaining divisions over the Republicans' demand for employer liability protections, with Pelosi insisting that any such provision be accompanied by stronger worker protections under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

None of those issues, Pelosi wrote to Mnuchin, have been resolved.

""The American people are suffering, and they want us to come to an agreement to save lives, livelihoods and the life of our American Democracy as soon as possible,"" Pelosi wrote. ""In light of these challenges, I respectfully await your attention to these urgent matters.""",2020-10-29 08:26:59-04:00,
Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority,"House Democrats are eyeing big gains in Tuesday's elections, propelled by an enormous fundraising advantage, a host of GOP retirements and an unpopular Republican president whose erratic handling of the coronavirus pandemic has threatened to damage his party down the ballot.

Not too long ago, the notion that Democrats would expand their majority in any significant fashion was virtually unthinkable. In January of 2019, at the start of the cycle, the party's campaign arm was bracing to protect dozens of vulnerable lawmakers in red-leaning regions, 30 of whom represent districts won by President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE in 2016.

Twenty-two months later they're on the offensive, buoyed by a historic fundraising haul, a highly energized base and President Trump’s sinking approval numbers, which have combined to produce highly competitive races even deep into Trump country.

ADVERTISEMENT

The changing dynamics have insulated many “front-line” Democrats, the incumbents deemed most vulnerable, while allowing Democratic operatives to expand their list of “red-to-blue” candidates — who are running tightly contested races in districts currently held by Republicans — from 33 to 38. Eighteen of those 38 challengers have forced competitive contests in districts that Trump won by more than 10 points four years ago.

“I would challenge anybody to say that going into this election cycle that anybody thought that we'd be playing deep into these [Trump] districts,” said Rep. Cheri Bustos Cheryl (Cheri) Lea BustosHouse Democrats run late ads defending vulnerable DCCC chair Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority GOP sees chance to take out Democratic House campaign chief MORE (Ill.), head of the Democrats' campaign arm.

“I would certainly rather be a Democrat running for Congress right now than a Republican. Not that I'd want to be a Republican, period,” she added. “But we're well positioned to have a good night.”

In recent days, Trump has pushed back on that narrative, predicting that Republicans will not only keep control of the White and Senate but also win back the House. He suggested voters will blame his political nemesis, Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided?

“After the election, we'll get the best stimulus package you've ever seen, because I think we're going to take back the House because of her,” Trump said of Pelosi. She, in turn, called his prediction “delusional,” and even many GOP lawmakers, aides and operatives are bracing for losses of anywhere between five and a dozen House seats.

It will be a “shit show,” said one House Republican when asked how his party will fare on election night.

Still, Democrats are approaching Election Day cautiously, recalling only too well the 2016 cycle, when Trump stunned the country by defeating Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE, despite polls showing a landslide for the Democrats.

“But this year,” he added, “it's a different kind of polling data.”

Fueling the optimism, election experts have steadily shifted races in the Democrats’ favor for weeks. In Virginia, for instance, first-term Reps. Abigail Spanberger Abigail Davis SpanbergerDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority During pandemic, 'telehealth' emerging as important lifeline to connect patients with caregivers MORE (D) and Elaine Luria Elaine Goodman LuriaDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority House lawmakers call for continued assistance to Lebanon MORE (D) were thought to be among the most vulnerable Democrats just a few months ago. Now they’re considered likely to prevail.

The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election handicapper, recently predicted the Democrats would pick up between five and 10 seats, with the possibility of netting 15.

“I think we’re gonna be closer to 15,” Hoyer said.

Central to the Democrats’ rosy outlook has been their success in raising money. Between July and September of this year, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee brought in more than $70 million — a record — and has outraised the GOP’s campaign arm by a whopping $57 million for the cycle.

After this story published, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee said that the Democrats' bullish prediction ""doesn't meld at all"" with the GOP's internal polling. He pointed out that 16 members of the NRCC's ""Young Guns"" program raised more money in the last full quarter before the election than their Democratic opponents.

Democrats have also benefited from a rash of Republican open seats, as 32 GOP lawmakers are retiring, running for other offices or lost their primary earlier in the year. A 33rd, Rep. Justin Amash Justin AmashDemocrats seek wave to bolster House majority Energized by polls, House Democrats push deeper into GOP territory Ocasio-Cortez draws hundreds of thousands of viewers on Twitch livestream MORE (L-Mich.), quit the GOP in mid-2019 to protest what he deemed Trump’s impeachable behavior and is also not seeking reelection.

From a practical standpoint, Democratic gains would have little effect on the workings of Washington. The party has controlled the House for the last two years, under Pelosi, and passed hundreds of bills advancing their priorities on health care, the economy, climate change and campaign finance reform — proposals they're already vowing to revisit next year.

Yet building a larger majority would provide Democrats a thicker buffer heading into 2022, when the party of the incumbent president has historically suffered big losses in Congress. That was the case in President Obama’s first term, when Pelosi lost the gavel. And predicting that Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE will win the White House, the once-again Speaker has made it no mystery that she wants to use the 2020 cycle to protect her gavel two years from now.

With much at stake, both sides are scrambling in the campaign’s final days to secure the best possible outcome — Democrats hoping for a wave and Republicans fighting to prevent one. Yet both sides are already warning that the unusual nature of pandemic-year voting likely means the full results won’t be known until days or even weeks after Nov. 3.

Bustos, for one, is already imploring reporters not to jump to conclusions about individual races until every vote is tallied.

“Wait for those votes to all be counted before making predictions,” she said. “Crack open a beer, take a little bit of a load off. Twitter can wait.”

But they warn the party nonetheless has a lot of work to do in the coming years as Democrats continue to make inroads across the state, especially in suburban areas.

For two cycles now, Texas Republicans have watched as Democrats picked off long-held GOP House seats in the Dallas and Houston suburbs, with the minority party continuing to go on offense in a number of seats few saw as possible pick-up opportunities years ago. This has set off alarm bells for party leaders, who warn that they have to right the ship before it is too late.

This time around, Democrats have made the state ground zero in their bid to expand their majority. According to the Cook Political Report, four seats are rated as either ""lean Democratic"" or ""toss-up"" — including three open seats — with two additional rated ""lean Republican"" that the party has its eyes on. On Wednesday, Cook also shifted Texas from “lean Republican” to “toss-up” in the presidential race.

Further down the ballot, Democrats are also looking to win the requisite nine seats to flip the Texas state House, which has been in GOP control since 2002. According to multiple GOP sources in the state, Republicans are hoping to minimize their losses to four seats. Democrats are more bullish though. Ed Espinoza, the executive director of Progress Texas, believes they will win control, noting that the two sides are fighting over 22 seats.

Republicans believe the situation requires GOP leaders across the state to message directly to voters rather than rely on the old tropes lawmakers occupying safe seats have in the past.

""There's no such thing as a safe seat,” said Dave Carney, a top strategist for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R). “There are safer seats, but there are no longer safe seats. ... Anybody should be prepared to have a fight.”

“You have to have candidates concerned about winning not just a primary, but a general,” Carney said, pointing to previously ruby-red seats in the western and eastern parts of the state. “They have to fight the fights on what's best in their congressional district.”

“You win minds and hearts, and you win minds and hearts by leading, and nothing is static. Nothing is permanent. California was a solid Republican state. ... The country ebbs and flows,” said Roy, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, in an interview with The Hill. “My general belief is Texans are strong, freedom-loving people. ... The values that conservatives espouse are American, Texas values. Espouse them, lead on them, don’t hedge on them. People will follow.”

“You can’t become tantric. You can’t become complacent. I’m not worried about [keeping your] head on a swivel,” Roy said. “I want a head that’s looking forward, but don’t be complacent. ... We’ve got an energized group of GOP people out working this hard. No one’s taking this for granted.”

Perry, who recruited many of the companies that brought their business to the Lone Star State before leaving the governor’s mansion in 2014, maintains that the population growth the state has experienced has been worthwhile politically, despite the continued leftward march of some districts and progress Democrats are experiencing statewide.

""Yes. ... I've heard this from the first business that came out of California to Texas. They were kind of like, ‘Perry, we want them to bring their money and business, but we don't want them to bring their politics,’” he said. “Here was my response: The vast majority of people that came out of California were givers. The takers stayed in California.”

The former governor also maintains Trump will emerge victorious next week. However, one thing Perry doesn’t regret is leaving the administration, having left his post atop the Department of Energy in December, only months before the coronavirus pandemic took hold.

MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin asked the speaker what Democrats can do if Trump prematurely declares victory on Election Night.

Pelosi responded, accusing the president of trying to ""stir the pot"" with his questioning the need to take extra time to count ballots cast by mail, and predicted that former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE would win the election.

""On January 20, 2021, Joe Biden will be inaugurated president of the United States. The states will count the votes that they have in a timely fashion,"" Pelosi said.

""The easiest thing for [Trump] to do is to stand up like a man and accept the results of an election of the American people,"" Pelosi continued. ""For him to make these kinds of statements shows his lack of patriotism, his undermining of our elections while he allows foreign countries like his friend [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to undermine the integrity of our election, he himself is doing it as well.""

It's possible that a winner in the presidential election won't be declared Tuesday night due to the volume of ballots cast by mail. Election officials have already seen a large influx of mail-in ballots over concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic and have warned that it may take additional days or weeks to tally them.

“It would be very, very proper and very nice if a winner were declared on Nov. 3, instead of counting ballots for two weeks, which is totally inappropriate and I don’t believe that that’s by our laws,” Trump said on Tuesday. “We’ll see what happens.”

Trump has repeatedly and without substantial evidence suggested that voting by mail will lead to widespread voter fraud, despite voting absentee himself in Florida primaries earlier this year.

Trump also declined to say on multiple occasions if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election to Biden. During an NBC News town hall earlier this month, Trump said that he would accept a peaceful transfer of power but said that he wanted an ""honest election.""

""Peaceful transfer? I absolutely want that. But ideally, I don’t want to transfer, because I want to win,"" Trump said during the town hall.

Ocasio-Cortez told Vanity Fair that she approached Yoho the day after the July confrontation and said to the Republican lawmaker, “You do that to me again, I won’t be so nice next time.”

Ocasio-Cortez also told the magazine that she felt his actions verged “into the zone of harassment, discrimination.”

During the incident earlier this year, which was overheard by a reporter for The Hill, Yoho told Ocasio-Cortez that she was “disgusting” for suggesting that poverty and unemployment were driving a spike in crime in New York City amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""You are out of your freaking mind,"" Yoho told her. Ocasio-Cortez told the Republican he was being “rude.”

Yoho later apologized for his tone in a speech on the House floor, addressing the “abrupt manner of the conversation I had with my colleague from New York.”

“Having been married for 45 years with two daughters, I'm very cognizant of my language,"" he added. ""The offensive name-calling words attributed to me by the press were never spoken to my colleagues, and if they were construed that way, I apologize for the misunderstanding.”

Ocasio-Cortez rejected the apology in a speech on the House floor, saying, ""This issue is not about one incident. It is cultural.”

""It is a culture of ... impunity, of accepting of violence and violent language against women, and an entire structure of power that supports that.""

“I am here because I have to show my parents that I am their daughter, and that they did not raise me to accept abuse from men,” Ocasio-Cortez also said. Those comments have gone viral on TikTok, with users lip-syncing to the lawmaker’s words while applying makeup.

Ocasio-Cortez said at the time of the incident that it was the first time since she was elected that another lawmaker has challenged her that aggressively.

""That kind of confrontation hasn't ever happened to me — ever,"" she said. ""I've never had that kind of abrupt, disgusting kind of disrespect levied at me.""",2020-10-28 10:21:37-04:00,

CNN reported that the ad, which was funded by nonpartisan voter participation group The Voter Project, is reportedly aimed at dispelling concerns about the accuracy and speed by which votes will be counted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led many Americans to vote by mail.

""These are unprecedented times. Because of the coronavirus, there were millions of votes cast by mail, so it may take longer than usual to count every vote. The folks in our election offices — your neighbors, family and friends, are working hard ensuring every single vote is counted,"" says Wolf in the ad, according to CNN.

""So it may take a little longer than we're used to, even a few days, but that's okay,"" he reportedly continues, adding: ""because it's critical that your vote is counted — and it will be.""

Some states, including Pennsylvania, allow ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to be counted only if they are received late due to the speed of the U.S. Postal Service.

""I think it's a terrible thing when people or states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over,"" Trump said on Sunday. ""I think it's terrible when we can't know the results of an election the night of the election in a modern-day age of computers.""

""The Election should end on November 3rd., not weeks later!"" he added in a tweet a few days earlier.

“We will be together. We’ll be there at the White House in D.C. This president has earned a second term,” the White House press secretary said on “Fox & Friends” when asked about plans for Tuesday evening.

Trump acknowledged last week that he was considering moving a planned gathering from Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., to the White House. He cited the District’s coronavirus restrictions as the reason for the possible change of plans. D.C. currently limits gatherings to 50 or fewer people.

That poll showed Clinton leading with a plurality, 45 percent to 42 percent, with third-party candidates pulling 12 percent of the vote. Clinton ultimately won the popular vote by 2.1 points, but lost the Electoral College along with the key swing states of Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

The survey, like other 2020 polling, shows Biden with a significant advantage among female voters, with 54 percent to Trump’s 41 percent. It also shows close to a dead heat among men, with 49 percent supporting Biden and 47 percent supporting Trump.

The former vice president has also significantly cut into Trump’s share of voters ages 45 to 64 compared to 2016. The poll shows Biden with 49 percent of voters ages 45 to 54 to Trump’s 47 percent, and 49 percent to 46 percent among voters ages 55 to 64. Trump led with 52 percent in both age groups in the 2016 survey.

Biden has cut into Trump’s lead among voters over 65 by an even bigger margin, leading 50 percent to 47 percent compared to Trump’s lead of 56 percent to 41 percent in 2016.

The final Monmouth University survey finds Biden at 51 percent and Trump at 44 percent among likely voters in a high-turnout scenario. That’s down from Biden’s 11-point lead in the same poll from last month.

In a low-turnout scenario, Biden’s lead shrinks to 5 points, 50 to 45. The September poll found Biden leading by 8 points in the low turnout scenario among likely voters. The previous poll was conducted shortly after the first presidential debate.

Both Biden and Trump will campaign in Pennsylvania on Monday. For Trump, Pennsylvania represents his best shot at holding on to one of the former “blue wall” states he flipped in 2016, as polls show Biden with comfortable leads in Wisconsin and Michigan.

Biden leads by 4.8 points in the FiveThirtyEight average of Pennsylvania, down from 7.3 points in mid-October.

“All eyes have been on the Keystone State from the start,” said Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray. “Pennsylvania voters may have responded more than most to key events, such as the conventions and the debates. This potential for movement is one reason why both campaigns have spent so much time there.”

Trump leads by 20 points in the counties he won easily in 2016, down from his 34-point margin that year.

In the 10 swing counties that were closest in 2016, Trump leads 49 to 45. That’s a big swing in Trump’s favor, as Biden led in those counties by 11 points only one month ago.

“Northeast Pennsylvania and other swing areas of the state are as hotly contested as they were four years ago,” Murray said. “Even without an advantage in this region, Biden is able to hold a statewide lead on the back of strong support in core blue areas along with his ability to nibble away at Trump’s margins in deep red areas.”

Biden leads by 16 points among whites with a college degree, while Trump leads by 21 points among non-college educated whites.

Biden leads by 22 points among voters under the age of 50, while Trump leads by 14 points among voters aged 50 to 64.

The candidates are tied among the oldest subset of voters. Biden led by 10 points among seniors in the prior Monmouth survey. Trump carried seniors by 10 points in 2016.

""The senior vote is up for grabs in Pennsylvania given the margin of error, but could end up decisively in either candidate’s camp on Tuesday,"" Murray said. ""However, the trend in this poll is in line with recent Monmouth polls in Florida and Georgia last week, suggesting that Trump may be clawing back a little bit of the senior vote in the campaign’s final days while Biden is strengthening his position among younger voters and people of color.""

The Monmouth poll of 502 registered voters in Pennsylvania was conducted from Oct. 28 to Nov. 1 and has a 4.4 percentage point margin of error.",2020-11-02 06:00:23-05:00,

What began as an election cycle focused on a narrow handful of states has blossomed into a coast-to-coast battlefield in which Republican-held states that haven’t sent a Democrat to Washington for decades are suddenly in play.

In interviews with more than a dozen strategists and pollsters on both sides of the partisan divide, those active in the fight for control of the Senate said the carefully planned campaign centered on just a few states blew up when the virus began spreading in March, and expanded further when Democratic candidates began reaping an unexpected and unprecedented harvest of small-dollar donations fueled by activist outrage.

Democrats need to gain a net of just three seats to recapture the majority. In the closing days of the campaign, as many as 14 Senate seats appear truly competitive — 11 of them currently held by the GOP.

Tillis has sought to turn the campaign into a referendum on Cunningham’s behavior, though the Democratic challenger has maintained a narrow lead in most public polls.

Those four seats alone would be enough for Democrats to capture control of the Senate, offsetting the likely loss of a seat in Alabama, where Sen. Doug Jones (D) trails former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville.

But Democrats have planted bulbs in other, less-fertile states, and they are starting to see green shoots. Recent polling shows Republican incumbents in Iowa, Montana, South Carolina and Alaska running just ahead of or even with their well-funded Democratic rivals. An open seat in Kansas, a state that hasn’t elected a Democratic senator since the height of the Great Depression, is also a close race.

“Thanks to strong Democratic candidates expanding the map, we're heading into the election on offense in more than a dozen Senate seats, including tough red states, and with multiple paths to the majority,” said Lauren Passalacqua, the spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “The biggest problem dragging down Republican incumbents is their toxic health care records and voting to gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions, even during a pandemic.”

Republicans have been more focused on defending their incumbents than expanding their opportunities.

Just days before Election Day, neither Democrats nor Republicans will say they are confident about their chances of winning a Senate majority in the next Congress. But Democrats have expanded a map that was once focused on just a handful of states, giving them more paths back to controlling the gavel than either party would have expected two years ago.

The instability in what once appeared to be a narrowly focused contest has come from a global pandemic that has disrupted Americans’ daily lives and their politics. Democrats have reprised their defense of the Affordable Care Act as the Trump administration challenges its constitutionality at the Supreme Court, even while a raging wave of infections sickens nearly 100,000 Americans every day.

“The [Republican] Party as a whole failed to understand nothing mattered until they got the virus under control,” said Shripal Shah, vice president of the Democratic super PAC American Bridge. “You can’t lie your way out of a pandemic.”

Republican senators have grown increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, to the extent that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.) avoided appearing at the White House over concerns that the administration was lax in protecting its own employees — a fear that proved well-founded after the president and several Republican senators got infected themselves.

“This has been as challenging a political environment as any for an incumbent party or for Republicans in general, and it’s a testament to the resilience of these Republican senators and the strategic decisions made on our side that there’s still a path to holding the Senate majority,” said Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC).

“You had to have demonstrated some virus competence,” said Brad Todd, a Republican strategist who advises Gardner and Tillis. Voters “have to feel like you’re working at it, that it’s a priority.”

Harrison is the most successful fundraiser in a cohort that has shattered records.

In Montana, Bullock raised $5.6 million for his presidential campaign — and about eight times as much, $42 million, for his Senate campaign.

That money has helped candidates fend off a barrage of outside attacks from the NRSC and the Senate Leadership Fund, the top Republican super PAC. That group has raised more than $300 million of its own this cycle, led by big-spending billionaires like the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam and the investors Ken Griffin, Stephen Schwarzman and Timothy Mellon. The super PAC’s Democratic equivalent, the Senate Majority PAC, has raised $254 million itself, according to the most recent filings.

Mild weather could boost voter turnout on Election Day,"Mild, dry weather expected this week could play a significant role in boosting voter turnout as polling places prepare for longer-than-usual lines amid a historic pandemic.

Research has shown that the weather on Election Day can have a noticeable impact on voter turnout. A 2007 study showed that rain “significantly reduces voter participation by a rate of just less than 1% per inch, while an inch of snowfall decreases turnout by almost .5%.”

And a 2017 report found that a ""positive change in temperature on Election Day remained significantly related to an increase in voter turnout. For each increase of 1°C (1.8°F), voter turnout increased by 0.14%.”

What makes the weather’s impact on this Election Day unique is the expected partisan effect it could have. With the spike in early voting across the nation being fueled largely by Democrats, Republican voters are expected to make up the difference during in-person voting on Tuesday — and impacts the weather has on Tuesday could disproportionately affect those voting for GOP candidates.

Here’s what the weather forecast predicts for Election Day 2020 by region:

New England

The weather across New England Tuesday should be cool and relatively dry, with highs ranging from the mid-30s to low-40s and low chances of rain. That’s slightly lower than usual, with the average temperature on Nov. 3 falling somewhere between the mid-40s and mid-50s in Boston, according to Weather Spark, but the lack of precipitation could halt a stark depression in turnout.

Northeast

The forecast across the Northeast Tuesday is warm and dry, prime weather for high turnout this Election Day. Manhattan will see a high of 47 degrees, and temperatures will hit the low 50s in Philadelphia.

The top prize of the Northeast is Pennsylvania, which will grant 20 electoral votes. The Keystone State had voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every race since 1988 but backed Trump by about 44,000 votes in 2016, lifting him over Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE by under 1 percent there. The good weather in Philadelphia is particularly positive news for Democrats, who are banking on high turnout in the blue-hued city and its surrounding suburbs.

There are also a handful of competitive House races in Staten Island and New York City’s suburbs, as well as New Jersey.

Mid-Atlantic

The weather in the Mid Atlantic will be similarly warm and dry, with Washington seeing a high of 57 degrees on Tuesday. Outside of some House races in the Virginia suburbs, there are no competitive races in this region this cycle.

South

There’s little chance of rain across the South this Tuesday, and temperatures will be comfortable, laying the groundwork for strong turnout in a region littered with battleground states.

Charlotte, N.C. will see a high of 65 degrees and just a 10 percent chance of rain, temperatures will hit 63 degrees in Atlanta, also with a 10 percent chance of rain at night, Miami will hit a high of 77 degrees with minimal chance of precipitation and Houston will also hit the low-70s.

A number of swing states are located in the South, a region that has the potential to determine the winner of the White House race. Polls show Biden with a slight lead in North Carolina and a neck and neck race in Georgia, Florida and Texas, which combined will allocated 83 electoral votes.



Midwest

The Midwest has just as much power to determine the next president as the South, and the two regions will have similar weather this Election Day as well.

Detroit and Milwaukee will both see minimal chances of rain and temperatures in the mid-50s, while Des Moines, Iowa will almost hit 70 degrees and Topeka, Kan., will hit 74 degrees.

Trump nearly swept the Midwest battlegrounds in 2016, winning Iowa, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin and losing Minnesota by a razor-thin margin. His path to reelection likely runs through winning at least three of those states, though polls show Biden with leads in Michigan and Wisconsin and running essentially tied with Trump in Iowa and Ohio, which went for the president by wide margins in 2016 and had initially been written off by Democrats.

Southwest

The Southwest is not chock full of battlegrounds but will see high temperatures and a dry climate on Tuesday.

Phoenix will hit 92 degrees on Tuesday, and Las Vegas will see highs in the mid-80s.

Arizona is the only true competitive state in the region, with polls showing Biden up there.

The Trump campaign has touted Nevada as a possible flip opportunity, though it is not expected to be a particularly tight race.

West Coast

The West Coast is the only region in the country expected to see some rainfall this Tuesday, though no states there are really in play at the presidential level.

Seattle will see temperatures in the mid-50s and a 60 percent chance of rain, while Portland, Ore. will see similar temperatures and also has a 60 percent chance of precipitation. There are no highly competitive races in either Washington state or Oregon beyond the contest to unseat Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R) in Washington’s 3rd Congressional District.

California will see better weather, with Los Angeles facing a 0 percent chance of rainfall and temperatures in the low 80s. The state is not competitive in the White House race, but the Los Angeles suburbs are home to a number of competitive House races.",2020-11-02 06:00:09-05:00,

The Democratic nominee is also ahead of the Republican incumbent in three of four polls of Arizona voters and four of six surveys in Florida, two states that are essential to Trump’s path to a second term.

Trump is by no means guaranteed defeat, but he is clearly in a worse position now than he was four years ago. Polls over the last weekend before the 2016 contest showed Trump trailing by slimmer margins in Michigan and Pennsylvania, and leading by a substantial margin in a state like Georgia.

This weekend's polls also showed Biden closer to or over the 50 percent mark nationally and in some battleground states, a point Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE never managed to reach in 2016.

One significant difference: Polls tend to show Libertarian and Green Party candidates collecting higher shares of the vote than they actually end up with on Election Day.

That suggests the polls are a better reflection of reality, and less likely to miss some kind of hidden support that could break late for one candidate or the other.

Biden is building a new coalition

Biden’s lead comes from some unlikely groups — those who voted for Trump four years ago.

In key swing states and nationally, Biden leads among independents, white voters with a college degree, voters in the suburbs and seniors, all groups that favored Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday The looming battle over Latino voters Arizona: On the fast track to swing state status MORE in 2012.

Shifts among white voters with a college degree have been especially stark. In 2016, Trump led Hillary Clinton among those voters by 6 points in Arizona, 8 points in Michigan, 12 points in Wisconsin and 27 points in Florida. Polls released this weekend show Biden leading among college-educated whites by 3 to 15 points in Arizona, 27 points in Michigan, 26 points in Wisconsin and 4 points in Florida.

Among independents, Trump beat Clinton in Georgia, Arizona, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by margins ranging from 3 points to 16 points. Over the weekend, Biden polled ahead of Trump among the demographic in every survey released in those states by margins up to 28 points in a Muhlenberg College poll in Pennsylvania.

It’s always important to remember that subgroups — like seniors or college-educated whites — are smaller samples that carry larger margins of error than the complete samples polled. What’s notable, though, is the breadth of the shift. Biden improves on Clinton’s performance in every single state and every single poll for which data on those subgroups was released.

We don’t know if these shifts are part of a long-term political realignment — frankly, “long-term” isn’t a terribly durable concept in an era in which five of the last seven elections have been waves. But Biden is setting up what looks like a historic coalition.

Older voters are skeptical of Trump

No Democrat has won senior voters since Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday A wave election? Or a fundamental realigning of American politics? Davis: 5 questions for Trump voters MORE’s reelection bid in 1996. But Biden is doing much better among voters eligible to collect Social Security than any of his recent predecessors.

Take Pennsylvania, a state Trump won by only about 44,000 votes in 2016. He beat Clinton among seniors by 10 percentage points, according to exit polls, 54 percent to 44 percent.

Four polls released this weekend all show Biden leading among the oldest cohort. He’s ahead among seniors by 4 points in the Muhlenberg College poll, by 6 in an Emerson survey, by 12 in a Siena College poll conducted for the New York Times, and by 15 points in a Washington Post/ABC News poll.

In Florida, Trump won seniors by a 57 percent to 40 percent margin. This weekend, Emerson and Siena both showed Biden leading, by 8 and 2 points, respectively.

There are signs that Trump’s lackluster response to the coronavirus pandemic has hurt him most among seniors, the population most vulnerable to the worst outcomes of COVID-19. State and national polls show seniors think Biden would do a better job handling the pandemic; those same polls also show seniors believe Biden would do a better job handling the economy.

Trump has not helped himself in recent weeks. After his own diagnosis, he urged Americans not to let the virus dominate their lives. That didn’t resonate well with seniors who very much do fear the virus, and who have missed grandchildren for the last seven months because of it.

Biden is limiting losses

ADVERTISEMENT

Biden’s campaign is doing well among those groups mentioned above that voted for Trump in 2016. But there is movement, too, among groups that still favor Trump.

Clinton’s performance among white voters who did not attend college in 2016 was abysmal, the end result of a long-term realignment of blue-collar Americans who no longer vote the way their unions advise — probably because they no longer belong to a union.

She lost among non-college educated whites by more than 20 points in Wisconsin. She lost the demographic by more than 30 points in Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan and North Carolina.

Polls this weekend show Biden losing those voters too — but by relatively slimmer margins. Polls show Biden losing those voters by about 5 points in Wisconsin, 15 points in Michigan, 20 points in Pennsylvania and by 25 in Florida. Big margins, to be sure — but not as bad as Clinton’s margins.

Pay attention to exit polls on race

Here’s one silver lining for Trump: In some swing states, he’s doing better among nonwhite voters than he did four years ago, in spite of a long history of stoking racial tensions.

ADVERTISEMENT

Polls this weekend showed Trump winning between 18 percent and 20 percent of the nonwhite vote in Pennsylvania, up from the 16 percent he won in 2016; in Ohio and Michigan, Emerson polls showed Trump improving on his 2016 standing among nonwhites by 7 points.

There’s not much indication that Trump has improved among Black voters specifically, despite his focus on an unemployment rate among Black Americans that dropped to its lowest rate since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping track. Trump takes just 8 percent of the Black vote in a CNN poll released over the weekend, about the same share as he collected there in the 2016 exit polls.

Polls of Hispanic voters in Florida are all over the place. In 2016, Trump won 35 percent of those voters in a state where the Hispanic population includes traditionally conservative people of Cuban and Venezuelan descent. An Emerson poll released this weekend showed Trump receiving just 21 percent of the Hispanic vote; a survey conducted by St. Pete Polls, a local outlet, had Trump claiming 46 percent of the vote among Hispanics.

Contra to Trump’s gains with nonwhite voters, Biden is doing better among white voters — and especially Southern white voters — than Clinton did. Polls this weekend show Biden outperforming Clinton’s vote share among whites in Georgia by 8 points, North Carolina by 4 to 8 points, and Florida by 8 points.

Up north, Biden is holding Trump’s advantage down among white voters. In Wisconsin, Trump won whites by 11 points in 2016; he leads by 6 in a CNN poll this weekend. In Michigan, Trump’s 21-point advantage from 2016 is now a 1-point lead for Biden. And in Pennsylvania, where Trump won whites by 16 four years ago, he’s now up by 4 points in the Washington Post-ABC poll and by 8 in the Muhlenberg College poll.

"Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic","After a chaotic several years for the agriculture industry, many farmers say they will vote for President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE again, even as his policies have hurt their bottom line.

Trump’s trade wars with China, Canada and Mexico rocked the industry, closing markets for farmers and pushing commodity prices down further. His pendulum swing on ethanol policies has also irked corn growers, while the coronavirus pandemic has delivered the latest gut punch.

Yet despite his support among growers being tested over the last four years, Trump is still expected to win the farm vote.

“I’ve lost so much money under him it's really a crime, and COVID really took another chunk out of me, but I'm voting for Trump because I'm worried about the country,” said Tim Burrack, who grows corn and soybeans on a 2,000-acre farm outside Arlington, Iowa.

Burrack said his concern over law enforcement issues, immigration and ""liberal policies,"" as well as what he sees as media bias toward the president, have pushed him toward Trump again after he questioned whether he would do so last year. That's despite losing an estimated $265,000 in 2019 due to Trump’s trade war and ethanol waivers given to refiners.

“You got to decide whether you support Trump’s trade policies or you don’t. I don't, so I didn't vote for him because of trade, I voted for him for the bigger picture,” he said.

Daryl Haack, a corn and soybean farmer near Primghar, Iowa, echoed the sentiment. Haack said his personal views on abortion and socialism — not farming — drove him to vote for Trump. And while he was hurt by the trade war, he said he felt it was necessary to counter China.

“I think most farmers realize that needed to happen. China was taking and still is taking advantage of us,” said Haack, who also voted for Trump in 2016.

Trump's approval rating among farmers has been dented since he carried farm country in 2016, but he continues to enjoy wide support among the industry.

A 500-person survey from agriculture information service DTN in August found support for Trump at 71 percent, down from 89 percent in April.

Still, those margins could make a difference in swing states like Iowa and Minnesota, both of which Trump put on his campaign travel schedule for the week leading up to Election Day.

“There are a lot of farmers that are disappointed in how Trump turned out for them, and I think he’s going to lose those guys, but then there's another other group of farm Trump supporters and when I bring up tariffs and how much damage it's done, they say, ‘Well China was an unfair trading partner so we have to do this,’ ” said Tim Dufault, who grows wheat outside of Crookston, Minn., and plans to vote for Democratic nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE.

Pam Johnson, who recently served as the Biden surrogate at a Farm Foundation debate, said she ""cannot figure out why someone would vote against their own business livelihood.""

“I feel like we’ve given Donald Trump a chance, and he’s failed us,” she said.

Johnson, who spent two decades working to expand markets for Iowa agriculture products overseas, blasted Trump's trade policies, saying she's seen 20 years of work virtually vanish.

“We want trade, we don't want aid. We want our markets back that we helped create,"" she said.

Nearly every farmer who spoke with The Hill, regardless of party, condemned Trump’s style of “trade by tweet” that have sent agriculture markets flying.

Even for farmers accustomed to good and bad years, falling commodity prices and narrowing markets plunged agriculture into a particularly bad cycle.

But fortunately for Trump, things have somewhat stabilized. Prices are up, and subsidy payments for the losses farmers incurred under the trade war and coronavirus have numbed a bit of the sting.

The Trump administration has given out $28 billion in assistance to offset trade losses over the last two years along with another $30 billion in aid for coronavirus. Despite the high totals, farmers say the payments only cover a fraction of their losses.

“I pay taxes, and when the government controls my industry and does things that hurt my industry, I don’t feel bad for taking payments that make up for the hurt,"" Haack said.

While farmers, a group known for their independence and resilience, have complex views on the subsidies, many cite other issues when explaining their support for Trump.

Jeff Samuelson, who grows corn and raises pigs near Tipton, Iowa, expressed concern over Hunter Biden and a Democratic Party he fears is moving too far left.

“I hope that whoever is elected president understands agriculture has a vital role in the national economy and that there are a lot of jobs that are tied back to farming,” Samuelson said. “But I’m not selfish enough to vote for someone who’s just going to be ‘good for the farmers.' ”

Samuelson estimated he lost between $75,000 and $100,000 last year due to a decrease in demand for corn.

He is not sure yet if he will make a profit this year. As coronavirus stalled the meat market, Samuelson built additional housing in order to avoid euthanizing any of his pigs before ultimately selling them for far below market price.

“I hate to have to take government money. I'd rather it went to someone who needed it, but we needed it this year, so that part of what he did for us we appreciate,” he said.

Johnson, the Biden surrogate, said farmers are getting too complacent about taking aid that leaves farmers “surviving, not thriving.”

“It’s socialism if it's the other guy getting the money, but if it's me getting the money, that's OK?” she said in reference to Trump backing farmers who say they are doing so to fight socialism.

Curt Knutson, a Republican who describes himself as “kind of a Trump supporter,” expressed frustration that so many fellow farmers feel the need to vote GOP across the board even when there are Democrats who are better on farm issues.

He said he thinks Trump will be better for farmers — the trade issues have begun to sort themselves out — while he thinks Biden’s pledge to transition away from fossil fuels would hurt the industry.

Trump’s remarks Sunday featured his usual attacks on his opponent. He sought to paint Biden, a moderate, as a proponent for radical progressive policies and as mentally incapable of handling the presidency. Trump displayed a video highlighting Biden’s past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and his recent gaffes on the campaign trail.

Trump attacked Biden’s son Hunter Biden and claimed that Joe Biden, if elected, would turn the country into a “prison state” that would prevent the economic recovery. Biden has said that he would follow the advice of scientists if they recommended a future nationwide lockdown, but that he does not believe that will be necessary to address the pandemic. Biden has also vociferously criticized Trump for failing to adequately respond to the pandemic, which has killed more than 230,000 Americans.

Trump, who faces vast disapproval among Americans over his handling of the pandemic, spoke optimistically about the prospect of a vaccine and declared that the U.S. is “rounding the corner” on the virus at a time when COVID-19 cases are surging across the country.

At one point during his rally in Rome, Ga., Trump mocked Biden for saying he would “follow science” on the pandemic.

“This election is a choice between a Biden depression and a boom like you’ve never seen before,” Trump said in Hickory, N.C. North Carolina is among several states seeing spikes in COVID-19 cases.

During his appearance in North Carolina, Trump also recited the poem “The Snake,” which he used during his 2016 campaign as he sought to portray threats posed by immigration. He claimed that a Biden administration would enact lax immigration policies.

The Iowa rally, which was staged in Dubuque, also doubled as an effort to reach out to voters in Wisconsin, another critical battleground that borders the city. Trump tailored some of his remarks to Iowa voters, highlighting his decision earlier this year to lift restrictions on the use of existing gas pumps to distribute higher-ethanol gasoline.

Most polls out of Iowa show a tight race between Trump and Biden, but Trump and his advisers have pointed to a new Des Moines Register poll showing Trump leading Biden by 7 percentage points as an indication the president has a comfortable lead in the state. Trump won Iowa by about 10 percentage points in 2016.

In Georgia, where Trump won by a decisive 5 percentage points in 2016, a RealClearPolitics average shows a tight race, with Biden holding an advantage of less than 1 percentage point over Trump.

Still, Trump, during his fourth rally of the day in Rome, claimed that aides told him he had Georgia “made” and didn’t need to visit the state, but that he decided to visit regardless.

A The Hill/HarrisX poll released last week showed Biden leading Trump 49 percent to 48 percent in North Carolina, where Trump won by more 3 percentage points in 2016. Trump holds a 0.6 percentage point advantage over Biden in North Carolina, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls.

Trump registered razor-thin victories in Michigan and Florida in 2016. Most polls have shown Biden with a decisive lead over Trump in Michigan, while the candidates are neck and neck in Florida, his final stop of the night on Sunday. According to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sunday, Trump has 50 percent of the vote among likely voters in Florida while Biden has 48 percent. Florida is viewed by many as critical to Trump’s reelection and is also the president’s home state.

Trump’s sprint through five states on Sunday stood in contrast to his campaign events the day prior, which were all staged in Pennsylvania. He will headline five more rallies on Monday — the eve of Election Day — including two in Michigan and singular events in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden, in contrast, held events exclusively in Pennsylvania Sunday and will travel to Pennsylvania and Ohio on the final day before Nov. 3.

“I think it’s a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election. I think it’s a terrible thing when people or states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over because it can only lead to one thing,” Trump told reporters in Charlotte, N.C., criticizing decisions by the Supreme Court to allow ballots to be received after Election Day in several battleground states.

While news networks have sometimes been able to call presidential races on Election Day or the day after, states normally take time to finish counting and certify results. This year, the number of mail-in ballots has exploded as campaign and election officials encourage people to send in ballots early and avoid polling places during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Supreme Court held last week in two separate cases that ballots in Pennsylvania and North Carolina that are not postmarked after Election Day and that arrive three and nine days after Nov. 3, respectively, will be counted. The rulings represented a victory for Democrats. In a separate ruling, the high court maintained a Nov. 3 deadline in Wisconsin for the receipt of mail ballots.

The high court also left open the possibility of taking up a still-pending GOP challenge to Pennsylvania counting procedures.

Trump, who has launched baseless attacks on the integrity of mail-in voting throughout the campaign, has made clear that he believes ballots should not be accepted after Election Day and criticized the Supreme Court last week. Mail-in voting has been expanded in many states during the coronavirus pandemic.

Trump has also demanded final results on Election Day, despite no state ever reporting its final presidential vote tally on the same day as the election. He told reporters Sunday that it was “terrible” that the results could not be known on the day of the election.

Trump’s remarks to reporters came as he landed for his third rally of the day in as many states. He is mounting an aggressive campaign schedule in the waning days of the campaign, traveling to multiple battleground states as he seeks to excite his supporters ahead of Election Day.

But with the country more polarized than ever — and in the throes of an escalating pandemic — Tuesday's election is seen as a referendum on the president, with third-party candidates unlikely to be accused of playing spoiler, regardless of the outcome.

""Our extreme partisan polarization means that there's not much room to run on the outside of either party,"" said Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at the University of California-San Diego.

“I think when you have two candidates that are clear, give voters a really clear choice between two different directions for the country, that makes it harder for third parties to make a traditional pitch that there's no real difference between these two major parties,” Kousser said.

However, Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, said there is some indication that as many people will vote for third parties this year as in 2016, noting that a few close to him have voted for Libertarian nominee Jo Jorgenson.

“Just because the big media isn’t paying attention to the Libertarians, it doesn't follow logically that [Jorgenson]’s gonna get a substantially smaller vote than Gary Johnson,” Winger said. “People have other ways of finding out about her than just the big media. We really don't know how many votes she's gonna get.”

In the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, Jorgenson with the support of 1.6 percent of likely voters nationwide and Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins comes in at .4 percent.

West, however, is not on the ballot in enough states to secure an Electoral College victory, and he's not expected to be a contender even where he is.

“I don't think he’ll get even a half a percent in any state,” Winger said. “Just because somebody is famous doesn't mean they get a lot of votes.”

According to a Morning Consult poll published Tuesday, only 3 percent of likely voters remain undecided, much lower than at the same point in 2016. For Hawkins, the reason is obvious.

“Donald Trump, people now know who he is, and they either like them or they don't, but they made up their mind,” he said. “So like I said, this election is all about Trump. It's a referendum on Trump. And most people have made up their mind.”

And a survey released Friday by Northeastern, Harvard and Rutgers indicated that 2016 third-party voters are breaking three-to-one in favor of Biden this year.

“The hatred of Trump overrides everything,” said David Barker, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. “And so they're willing to put those things aside and really eschew even thinking about voting for a Green Party candidate or another third-party candidate in the way they did in 2016, because it is such a strong goal to get rid of Trump.”

Barker said that earlier this year, he might have anticipated third-party candidates playing spoiler in the election, but the coronavirus pandemic and multiple high-profile police-involved shootings of Black Americans have given voters a sense of responsibility to vote against a second Trump term, even if they don’t love Biden.

“We've never had a figure this polarizing in the history of modern American politics,” Barker said. “For anybody who was undecided as of March or April or May or June, this pandemic has really moved the share of those people into the camp of well, ‘Geez, things are going worse and we know who to blame.”

“And if anybody didn't make up their mind because of that, there were all the racial justice protests around police brutality that have been happening all through the summer,” he added. “So, once you take all that into account, there's going to be a very small handful of people who haven't made their mind up.”

Jorgensen’s campaign manager, Steve Dasbach, rejects the ""spoiler"" mentality, saying he wants voters to know that there are options beyond the two main parties.

“I haven't quite figured out yet how when I mark Jo Jorgensen on the ballot, it magically turns into a vote for Trump or Biden,” Dasbach said. “I haven't seen that happen yet. But apparently, according to what the partisans for Biden and Trump say, this is an immediate occurrence that your vote for a third party candidate is actually a vote for someone else.”

“I think it just shows an arrogance that, you know, that somehow they own our votes, that they are entitled to our vote and the only thing we're allowed to do is to choose whether we want the red version or the blue version,” added Dasbach, who also previously served as the national director of the Libertarian Party and chair of the Libertarian National Committee.

Dasbach blamed national news outlets for their lack of coverage on Jorgensen and other alternative candidates, saying the media chose to ""frame the race as Trump versus anti-Trump, because they felt that the best way to get Trump defeated is to unite everybody who doesn't like Trump.""

Hawkins also pushed back on the notion that his campaign is spoiling the effort to get Trump out, saying deeper reforms are needed for a more representative democracy.

“Get rid of the Electoral College and have a national popular vote using rank choice voting,” he said. “I mean, the problem for the Democrats is the Electoral College installed losers like Donald Trump and George Bush in the presidency in the 21st century after they lost the popular vote. And the only reason it was close enough for the Electoral College to do that was massive voter suppression.”

Trump's Electoral College victory including winning the states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan by fewer than 80,000 votes combined, a razor-thin margin that Kousser said further decreases the chance of voters going third party this time out.

“After the last election where it was so close in some states ... people feel like no state is out of reach,” he said. “And so, they want to make sure that their vote is not wasted on a candidate who isn't, you know, one of the two front-runners.""",2020-11-01 17:40:16-05:00,

Trump’s remarks came after his supporters in Opa-Locka, Fla., broke out into loud chants of “fire Fauci.”

“Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election,” Trump responded to the crowd.

“I appreciate the advice. I appreciate the advice. No, he's been wrong though a lot. He's a nice man though. He's been wrong on a lot,” Trump continued.

The president went on to attack Fauci’s credibility, criticizing him for altering his early position on the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, as did other top health experts. Trump also claimed that Fauci opposed his decision to restrict travel from China, despite the top health official publicly backing it.

It’s not clear how serious Trump is about trying to remove Fauci, one of the most trusted health experts on the pandemic, an action that would undoubtedly be met with swift and sweeping public blowback. Trump also cannot directly fire Fauci, a career civil servant, but would need to order his political appointees to do so. Fauci, who has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1985, could also appeal his removal because of the protections given to career federal government employees.

Tensions between Trump and Fauci, who was a regular fixture at White House coronavirus briefings earlier this year, have been building for months due to the president’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and disregard for public health guidelines.

Fauci has publicly criticized Trump’s large campaign rallies, which the president has continued to hold despite the pandemic and rising cases, and offered blunt assessments of the threat posed by COVID-19 that contrast the president’s own efforts to minimize the danger of the virus. Trump, who himself was diagnosed with COVID-19 in October, has repeatedly claimed that the United States is “rounding the turn” on the virus even as cases have recently surged across the country.

Fauci’s willingness to contradict Trump publicly has made him a target of the president’s allies and supporters.

Trump’s remarks Sunday, made after midnight during his fifth and final campaign rally that day, came after Fauci in an interview with The Washington Post warned about the climbing infections and offered frank criticism of the White House response.

“We’re in for a whole lot of hurt. It’s not a good situation,” Fauci told the Post. “All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.”

I especially apologize to the national security community who is working hard to defend us. — Scott W. Atlas (@SWAtlasHoover) November 1, 2020

In his RT interview, Atlas, a neuroradiologist, criticized lockdown policies implemented due to the pandemic, saying they are “killing people,” according to Business Insider.

Public health officials have sometimes supported these policies to limit the spread of the virus and ensure people are not in close contact with one another, but most states haven’t been under full lockdowns since the early summer.

""It's a deadly pandemic, there's no understating that,"" Atlas said. ""We've had 230,000 lives roughly lost from the virus and certainly many lost from the policy of shutdowns.""

""The lockdowns will go down as an epic failure of public policy,"" he added. ""The argument is undeniable. The lockdowns are killing people.""

Atlas also alleged that shutdowns and other coronavirus restrictions are “creating a generation of neurotic children” and leading more college students to kill themselves “due to the lockdown,” Business Insider noted.

The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention did see an increase in those aged 18 to 24 considering suicide in June, but that statistic was not directly linked to shutdowns.

Experts have said the early shutdowns in the country saved tens of thousands of lives.

Last month, Twitter removed one of Atlas’s tweets that questioned the use of masks, sparking the White House adviser to condemn the social media platform.

“We’re in for a whole lot of hurt. It’s not a good situation,” Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, told The Washington Post in an interview this weekend. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that “all the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors.”



“You could not possibly be positioned more poorly,” he continued.

In a broad interview with the paper, Fauci warned of the country reaching a point where it could see more than 100,000 coronavirus cases recorded daily if it does not reverse course quickly when it comes to public health practices. His comments come shortly after the country recorded a surge in COVID-19 infections last week and as multiple states have reported record numbers of cases in recent weeks.

He also said that the coronavirus task force has been having fewer meetings, despite rising cases in the country and that “the public health aspect of the task force has diminished greatly.”

Fauci said the last time he and the president spoke was around the start of October.

“The last time I spoke to the president was not about any policy; it was when he was recovering in Walter Reed, he called me up,” Fauci told the paper.

“All of a sudden, they didn’t like what the message was because it wasn’t what they wanted to do anymore. They needed to have a medical message that was essentially consistent with what they were saying,” he said in the interview.

While he told the paper that he has been attending staff meetings by phone, he also said he hasn’t been at the White House often since it saw its own coronavirus outbreak among staffers last month.

The interview comes roughly two weeks after Trump blasted Fauci in a call with his campaign staff, saying the public health expert was a “disaster” and claiming that Americans “are tired of COVID.”

“Yup, there’s going to be spikes, there’s going to be no spikes, there’s going to be vaccines. With or without vaccines, people are tired of COVID,” Trump said on the call, according to audio obtained by The Hill. “I have the biggest rallies I have ever had and we have COVID. People are saying whatever, just leave us alone. They’re tired of it.”

“People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these people, these people that have gotten it wrong. Fauci is a nice guy, he’s been here for 500 years, he called every one of them wrong,” Trump also said.

Fauci said in his interview over the weekend that the “the only medical person who sees the president on a regular basis is Scott Atlas.”



“It’s certainly not Debbie Birx,” he added before going on to criticize Atlas, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a member of the White House coronavirus task force.

“He insists he’s not somebody who’s pushing for herd immunity,” Fauci told the paper. “He says, ‘That’s not what I mean.’ [But] everything he says — when you put them together and stitch them together — everything is geared toward the concept of ‘it doesn’t make any difference if people get infected. It’s a waste of time. Masks don’t work. Who cares.’”



“And the only thing you need to do is protect the vulnerable, like people in the nursing homes,” Fauci said.

Trump's focus on Pennsylvania underscores both his campaign's belief that the race there is close and the reality that he may be hard pressed to win re-election without carrying the Keystone State.

Biden and Obama traveled to Michigan, seeking to shore up support in a state that Democrats neglected and narrowly lost four years ago. The two held drive-in rallies in Flint and Detroit.

The tone and substance of the events reflected the bitter nature of the campaign as Election Day nears.

Trump and Biden have for months made clear their personal dislike for one another, and that was on display at competing events on Saturday.

The president in Newton, Pa., implied Biden had plastic surgery on his face, telling the crowd ""he should get a little bit of a larger frame,"" referring to the aviator sunglasses Biden wears.

""He doesn't want to have people look at that surgery on the eyes,"" Trump added.

At a subsequent rally in Reading, Pa., Trump invoked Biden's words in 2018 that he would beat the president up if the two were in high school, citing Trump's comments about sexually assaulting women on an ""Access Hollywood"" recording from 2005.

ADVERTISEMENT

""Do you remember like a year ago, year and a half ago, he said, 'I’d like to take him to the back of the barn.' A slight slap,"" Trump said, miming hitting someone with a backhand and suggesting he could easily knock Biden over.

Biden, speaking at nearly the same time, happened to harken back to his high school comments.

""When you were in high school wouldn't you have liked to take a shot?"" Biden asked supporters in Flint, Mich.

The former vice president derided Trump as ""Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinBiden begins two-day campaign sprint in battleground Pennsylvania Trump, Biden trade insults as they duke it out in key battlegrounds Guard stabbed at French Consulate in Saudi Arabia MORE's puppy"" and a president who ""commands virtually no respect on the international stage.""

""Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are,"" Biden said. ""We choose hope over fear. Unity over division. Science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies.""

But it was Obama who has savaged Trump most thoroughly in his appearances on the campaign trail, and that remained true on Saturday as he appeared alongside Biden for the first time during this campaign.

Obama has let loose on Trump in a way that is unusual for a former president to talk about his successor, reflecting both the personal animosity and the way in which Trump has aimed to undo most of Obama's accomplishments.

The 44th president bashed Trump as incompetent and unwilling to adapt to the requirements of the job. He excoriated the administration over its handling of the ongoing pandemic, which has killed more than 230,000 Americans.

And Obama mocked Trump for his infatuation with crowd size, something the president likes to point out about his rallies to argue voter enthusiasm is on his side.

“What is his obsession by the way with crowd size? You notice that?” Obama said. This is the one measure he has of success. He’s still worried about his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine. It really bugged him. He’s still talking about that.”

“Did nobody come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Is he traumatized?” the former president continued. “What’s with crowds?”

Obama, who remains extremely popular within the Democratic Party, has emerged as an active surrogate for his former vice president. He appeared in Florida and Pennsylvania over the past week, and he is expected to campaign in Florida and Georgia on Monday.

Beyond the attack lines, the visits were intended to solidify support in two states that are critical for each respective campaign.

Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by just 44,000 votes, and his path to re-election becomes increasingly narrow if he's unable to win the Keystone State again. Polls show Biden with a slight lead in the state.

In a transparent attempt to score points in Pennsylvania, Trump on Saturday announced his administration would conduct a review of the economic benefits of hydraulic fracking and potential economic consequences should the practice be halted.

Biden has said he would not ban fracking, but Trump and his advisers have argued that he would buckle to pressure to do so once in office.

Biden, meanwhile, has maintained a steady lead in Michigan, according to polls.

Experts say government employees have a right to political speech and that past administrations have also had officials toe the line between governing and campaigning, especially in the final stretch of the campaign season.

But the Trump administration has gone much farther than any other in shattering traditions that have previously kept governing separate from campaigning, and done so in a blatant manner, they said.

“Traditionally, a lot of officials in administrations would do this subtly,” said Julian Zelizer, political history professor at Princeton University. “There was some kind of thin firewall that was used.”

“It’s just the Trump administration is just not at all about resisting totally politicizing everything. There is no subtlety in terms of what is happening,” Zelizer added.

In August, Trump delivered his Republican National Convention speech on the White House grounds.

Multiple administration officials have been accused of violating the Hatch Act, which prohibits White House staff from engaging in campaign activity in their official government roles. And the president on Friday floated the idea of holding his election night party at the White House.

“It breaks some pretty fundamental norms of a separation of governments from campaigns. We are not used to seeing the American government using its own power to keep itself in power,” said Jordan Libowitz, communications director for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

The developments also underscore the degree to which Trump is relying on his officials to boost his election prospects.

Perhaps no White House official has blurred the lines between campaign and government roles like press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Prior to serving in the White House, she worked as the national press secretary for the Trump campaign.

She appeared multiple times this week on Fox networks from Trump campaign headquarters under the title “Trump 2020 campaign adviser,” and she openly attacked Biden’s policies and commented on protocols at Trump rallies.

The president called McEnany on stage to speak at an Arizona rally last week. During a campaign rally on Thursday in Florida, Trump played a video of McEnany’s appearance on Fox News criticizing social media executives for their actions to suppress tweets sharing a New York Post story about Hunter Biden and describing the election as a choice between Biden’s “lock down” and Trump’s plan to “safely reopen this country.”

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday, McEnany reverted back to her press secretary role, telling reporters to ask the campaign for details on whether Trump planned to put his own money into his reelection bid.

The White House said McEnany “was appearing in her personal capacity as a private citizen.” A campaign official said McEnany appears “on a volunteer basis” for the reelection effort and that the shows have been instructed not to refer to her with her White House title in those situations.

The White House offered a similar explanation for why Miller and Kudlow, two of Trump’s top advisers, were appearing on Trump campaign calls with the press this week.

Other administration officials have been using official business and official channels to make the case for Trump’s reelection or visit areas that are key to his electoral college path.

O’Brien traveled to Minnesota and Wisconsin in recent days to tour a mining facility and a shipyard, respectively. Trump and Vice President Pence have campaigned aggressively in both states, but the National Security Council maintained O’Brien’s visits were intended to assess the country’s defense capabilities and supply chains.

“The important work of protecting our national security continues regardless of domestic political events, and often that involves leaving the White House to visit with the skilled workers and leaders who deliver top quality products that help our servicemen and women keep our country safe,” NSC spokesman John Ullyot said.

Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, used an event in Texas on Thursday meant to highlight progress on border wall construction to openly advocate for Trump’s policies.

“As a direct result of this president and this administration — this is not a political statement, this is just a matter of fact — we have a stronger relationship with the government of Mexico and our partner countries in the Northern Triangle country than we ever have before.”

Morgan, without naming Biden, went on to warn that a platform that supports sanctuary cities and other protections for immigrants in the country illegally “will drive an illegal invasion.”

“Our tweets are approved by career ethics attorneys and thankfully no longer overseen by you,” the agency’s press secretary tweeted.

William Howell, a political scientist and professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, said that the Trump administration officials’ behavior over the past week was not especially surprising given the way officials have pushed boundaries in the past. He also said it was not particularly unusual for government officials to engage in some degree of political activity in their personal capacity.

“In the constellation of examples of norm-breaking under this president, this doesn’t strike me as especially egregious,” Howell said.

But Howell argued that it underscored the degree to which Trump has needed to lean on government officials in the absence of a deeper pool of surrogates to rely on outside government.

Trump, while speaking at a rally in Waterford Township, Mich., on Friday, argued without evidence that doctors are improperly counting coronavirus deaths for monetary gain.

""Our doctors get more money if somebody dies from COVID. You know that, right? I mean our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say, 'I'm sorry, but everybody dies of COVID,'"" he said.

Trump argued that other countries put less of an emphasis on COVID-19 as a cause of death than the U.S. does, adding, ""With us, when in doubt, choose COVID. It's true.""

Trump pushed a similar claim during a rally in Wisconsin last weekend, saying that ""doctors get more money and hospitals get more money"" if COVID-19 is listed as a cause of death.

Susan Bailey, the president of the AMA, pushed back on Trump's claims, pointing to work physicians, nurses and frontline health care workers have done during the pandemic to treat their patients.

“They did it because duty called and because of the sacred oath they took. The suggestion that doctors—in the midst of a public health crisis—are overcounting COVID-19 patients or lying to line their pockets is a malicious, outrageous, and completely misguided charge,” Bailey said in a statement Friday without directly naming the president.

The AMA, the country’s largest doctors group, has criticized the Trump administration before. In August, the group blasted the federal government's guidance that asymptomatic individuals do not need to be tested for the coronavirus, warning it would like to a spike in cases.

Bailey noted Friday that coronavirus cases in the U.S. hit record highs this week, recording roughly 97,000 new infections on Friday alone. The figure broke the previous record of 88,521 new coronavirus cases, which had been set on Thursday.

The nationwide surge in cases comes just ahead of the winter season, during which experts say the increase will be exacerbated as social gatherings move indoors, where the virus can spread more easily.

“Rather than attacking us and lobbing baseless charges at physicians, our leaders should be following the science and urging adherence to the public health steps we know work—wearing a mask, washing hands and practicing physical distancing,” Bailey concluded in her statement.

Trump argued that other countries were attributing deaths among coronavirus patients to underlying factors but claimed medical professional in the U.S. were listing anything as a coronavirus-related death to obtain additional funds.

""In Germany and other places, if you have a heart attack or if you have cancer, you're terminally ill, you catch COVID, they say you die of cancer, you died of heart attack. With us, when in doubt, choose COVID. It's true. No, it's true. Now they'll say, 'Oh, that's terrible what he said,' but that's true. It's like $2,000 more so you get more money,"" Trump said.

CNN noted that, according to medical professionals, if someone who has a preexisting condition gets coronavirus and then dies, their cause of death would be COVID-19.

""The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person's death. In 92% of all deaths that mention COVID-19, COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause of death,"" Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said last month in a statement provided to CNN.

Trump has faced widespread criticism for his remarks.

Doctors and nurses were also among those who took to Twitter to push back against the president’s remarks.

Even as COVID-19 cases rise to record levels across the nation, Trump repeatedly insists the country is “rounding the turn” on the pandemic.

He is pressing ahead with large-scale campaign rallies, showing no signs of backing off his plans to hold 14 major campaign gatherings in the three days leading up to the election.

ADVERTISEMENT

Along the way, he is calling on states to lift public health restrictions in order to boost the economic recovery and raising unrealistic expectations about the development of an effective vaccine and therapeutics.

“If you get it, you’re going to get better,” Trump, who contracted the disease earlier this month, told a crowd of supporters in Waterford Township, Mich., on Friday. “Then you’re going to be immune, and it’s a whole thing, and it goes away.”

Biden, meanwhile, is laser focused on using the final days of the campaign to hammer Trump over his administration’s response to a virus that has killed more than 225,000 people in the U.S.

Seizing on comments made by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsSunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day Biden and Trump closing arguments diverge sharply on COVID-19 Democrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' MORE, Biden said Trump has decided to let the coronavirus win.

“Donald Trump has given up. The White House chief of staff said it out loud last week. He said we’re not going to control the pandemic,” Biden said at a car rally in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday. “Donald Trump has waved the white flag. He surrendered to this virus.”

Biden has stepped up his in-person events in the final stretch, but his rallies are significantly scaled back in order to adhere to public health guidelines.

Instead of massive gatherings in airport hangers with tens of thousands of people, Biden has favored “drive-in” rallies, where people stay close to their cars as a way to minimize the threat of COVID-19 infection.

For weeks, the dissonance between the two candidates has been unmistakable on an issue that has defined the campaign and remains one of the top issues for many voters.

The majority of Americans disapprove of the way Trump has handled the public health crisis. Polls show that voters trust Biden to handle the coronavirus more than they do Trump, who is lagging behind the former vice president in national and most swing state polling.

Despite that, Trump has not adjusted his rhetoric, repeatedly minimizing the threat posed by the coronavirus, questioning the efficacy of masks and disagreeing publicly with the advice of top experts.

After his own COVID-19 diagnosis, Trump insisted that Americans should not let the virus “dominate” their lives.

As part of his treatment, the president received experimental drugs that are not yet available to the public, which he now calls “cures,” and he is pressuring federal scientists to speed up their authorization.

The message from Trump that the virus is no longer a threat was echoed by the White House science office this past week when it listed “ending the COVID-19 pandemic” as one of the president’s top accomplishments, sparking widespread criticism.

Trump has also been eager for businesses and schools to resume normal operations as he tries to make the case to voters that he is the best steward for an economy that was once consistently growing but is now in recession.

“I don’t think this was a president ever who was going to stake his case on reelection on his ability to manage an international health crisis. His was a story of law and order and economic growth,” said William Howell, a political scientist and professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.

“What he wants to do is change the subject, and the facts on the ground are not cooperating.”

Biden has emphasized that, unlike Trump, he will follow the advice of scientists. On Wednesday, he sat for a remote briefing with medical experts, including former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy Vivek Hallegere MurthyBiden and Trump closing arguments diverge sharply on COVID-19 Hillicon Valley: Twitter tightens rules before election | Intelligence chief briefed lawmakers on foreign influence threats | Democrats launch inquiry into Pentagon's moves on a national 5G network Airbnb to require hosts to adhere to enhanced cleaning protocols or risk being booted off the platform MORE.

In a speech after his briefing, Biden acknowledged the challenges that lie ahead.

""Even if I win, it's going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic. I'm not running on the false promise of being to end this pandemic by flipping a switch,"" Biden said, adding he will ""start on day one doing the right things.""

""We'll let science drive our decisions,"" he continued.

Trump on Friday staged rallies in three battleground states —Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin — that have some of the worst COVID-19 infection rates in the country. Hospitals are at or near capacity in all three states.

The signature rallies are a cornerstone of Trump’s campaign, much like they were in 2016, and he often points to his crowd size as a measure of his popularity while mocking Biden over the low turnout for his events.

He has also accused Democratic governors of deliberately implementing stringent rules to stop him from campaigning in their states, targeting leaders in Pennsylvania and Minnesota this week.

""We're having a problem with some people in Minnesota because they have a cap,"" Trump said at the White House before leaving for Friday's rallies, citing a spat with local officials over the number of attendees who could attend a rally in Rochester.

ADVERTISEMENT

""We have 25,000 people in Minnesota, and they say you can only have 250 people. So they thought I'd cancel. We're not going to cancel,"" Trump said.

While they draw large throngs of thousands of supporters, the rallies appear to be out of step with the sentiment of the majority of the American public.

A Suffolk University-USA Today poll released Thursday found that 60 percent of voters disapprove of Trump’s decision to hold large campaign rallies during the pandemic, while 35 percent approve. That disapproval included 15 percent of Republicans and 59 percent of independents.

Blois Olson, a political communications strategist in Minnesota who authors a daily political newsletter, said Trump’s decision to hold rallies without requiring masks or enforcing social distancing had turned off some independent-minded voters in the state.

Olson noted, for instance, that Trump appears to have lost ground with senior voters in a state he narrowly lost in 2016 and is now one of the few his campaign hopes to flip on Tuesday.

“It’s kind of the throwing caution to the wind that is giving people some pause,” Olson said.",2020-10-31 07:56:53-04:00,
The Memo: Trump retains narrow path to victory,"Victory for President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE in Tuesday’s election remains a distinct possibility, despite the fact that he lags in national polls.

There is no question that Trump is the underdog against his Democratic opponent Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE.

Biden has several realistic routes to the 270 electoral votes needed to claim the White House, and a Democratic landslide is also possible.

But there are plausible scenarios that give Trump a narrow path to a second term — and they are giving Democrats sleepless nights.

Above all, Democrats are traumatized by the memory of what happened four years ago, when Trump won a shock victory over Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE, despite polling projections that showed her as the overwhelming favorite.

“It’s hard to forget the nightmare of 2016 and how wrong things were, so that’s a cloud that lingers over this election,” said one Democratic strategist who requested anonymity to speak candidly.

Trump’s simplest and easiest route to victory this year is to hold onto Florida and Pennsylvania, both of which he won in 2016. Florida is, as usual, a tight race — Biden led there by 1.2 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average on Friday afternoon.

Some Florida Democrats have expressed concern about Biden’s standing with Latinos, especially in the Cuban American community. There are also some signs that voter enthusiasm in Trump-friendly parts of Florida is roughly equal to the anti-Trump fervor in Democratic strongholds.

Biden’s polling lead in Pennsylvania is bigger, at 3.6 percentage points — but that’s hardly an invincible margin, especially if state-level polls are off as they were in 2016. The president has three events scheduled for Pennsylvania on Saturday.

If Trump won Florida and Pennsylvania, he could afford to lose two key states, Michigan and Wisconsin, so long as he held onto the other states that he won in 2016 — including Arizona, where he is under significant pressure.

This scenario gives Republicans hope, despite all the polls in which the president is trailing. Some in the GOP also take a measure of encouragement from Biden’s travel schedule, which included a stop in Minnesota on Friday. Clinton carried Minnesota four years ago and the Trump campaign has targeted it as a rare pick-up opportunity this year.

“Despite the polls, it feels like [Trump] has a 50-50 shot at winning,” said GOP strategist Ron Bonjean. “Everyone is holding their breath. … The Biden team is not measuring the drapes for the White House. If you look at where they are going in the last few days, they are nervous.”

For all that, Biden is the clear favorite.

He is running against the most polarizing president of modern times during a pandemic that has claimed more than 225,000 American lives. He retains leads, slender or otherwise, in the vast majority of battleground states. He is competitive in southern states such as Georgia and Texas in a way that no other Democrat has been in a generation.

Independent experts note that Michigan and Wisconsin appear to be slipping out of reach for the president — a trend which reduces his options, even if it is not a fatal blow.

""If he doesn't get over the top in Wisconsin and Michigan, then he has got to hang onto all those other states [including Florida and Pennsylvania] and either get Arizona, or miss in Arizona but pick off Nevada,"" said Steve Kornacki, national political correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC.

Even some Democrats scarred by Clinton’s 2016 loss insist this time really is different.

They point to a number of factors, including the consistency of Biden’s polling lead and the fact that, unlike Clinton, he has never been broadly disliked.

“Several things are different,” John Podesta, who served as Clinton’s campaign chairman, told The Hill earlier this week. “One is that — somewhat remarkably, given all the advertising hits you take — Biden’s favorability remains in positive territory.”

Podesta also noted that Biden draws more than 50 percent of all voters’ support in many polls — something which Clinton almost never did. And, he added, Biden has “much less of a third-party problem” — a reference to the 2016 candidacies of the Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson Gary Earl JohnsonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Polarized campaign leaves little room for third-party hopefuls The Memo: Trump retains narrow path to victory MORE and the Green Party’s Jill Stein, who together won almost 6 million votes.

Lanny Davis, a longtime Democratic strategist and a strong supporter of the Clintons, highlighted the narrowness of Trump’s victory in 2016. The crucial aggregate margin across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin was approximately 77,000 votes.

Davis also noted the extraordinary developments in the closing days of the 2016 campaign — including the controversial intervention of then-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyThe Memo: Trump retains narrow path to victory Analysis: Where the swing states stand in Trump-Biden battle Spies are trying to influence the election — US spies, that is MORE — and said nothing similar had occurred this year.

“With no Comey letter — and with the escalation of the COVID crisis, which [Trump] denies — it is virtually impossible that Joe Biden won’t do 70,000 votes better in those three states,” said Davis, who is also a columnist for The Hill.

Nervousness is by no means confined to the Democratic side. A Trump defeat in Texas, for example, would be catastrophic not just for his chances but for the GOP writ large. A loss in Georgia would also be a stinging blow.

“We'll all be watching Georgia. If you lose Georgia, you’re done,” said one GOP strategist with ties to the White House.

More broadly, the political world is grappling with the sheer uncertainty of an election revolving around Trump, and being held amid unprecedented circumstances.

""I know it's not much of a prediction, but the range of possible electoral vote outcomes here is far and wide,"" said Kornacki, ""from Biden wins with 413 electoral votes to Biden loses with 264 — and anything in-between.""

With just days to go, Democrats know Biden is in the driver’s seat. But they are torturing themselves with all kinds of questions — about black turnout, and Trump’s ground game, and voter suppression, and whether they could be swamped by high Republican turnout on Election Day itself.

But one question looms over every other: What if the polls are wrong?

“Pollsters don’t want to admit a simple fucking fact: there is some percentage of silent Trump voters,” said the Democratic strategist who requested anonymity. “There are people who are not going to tell you that they are going to vote for Trump. We can pretend it’s not a fact. But it is.

“The real question is, how many of them are there?”

Miller told NBC News in an interview that a second-term agenda regarding immigration would revolve around curtailing how many people are granted asylum, outlawing “sanctuary cities,” bolstering the administration’s travel ban with stricter screening for visa applicants and implementing new restrictions on work visas.

Miller told NBC News that the goal is ""raising and enhancing the standard for entry"" to the United States and that it will be accomplished both by executive action and legislation.

""In many cases, fixing these problems and restoring some semblance of sanity to our immigration programs does involve regulatory reform,"" Miller said. ""Congress has delegated a lot of authority ... and that underscores the depth of the choice facing the American people.""

Specifically, Miller did not commit to lifting a freeze on new green cards and visas but said the administration would seek to bolster ""burden-sharing"" deals with Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to prevent asylum-seekers from leaving Central America and arriving in the U.S., punish jurisdictions for failing to turn undocumented immigrants over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and vet ""ideological sympathies or leanings"" of visa applicants.

Trump campaigned in 2016 on hard-line immigration stances, including building a border wall with Mexico, and has adopted similarly tough policies while in office, including expanding the number of children who were separated from their parents in his “zero tolerance policy” that drew bipartisan condemnation.

Immigration has largely been relegated to the background in the 2020 cycle amid concerns over the coronavirus pandemic and the related economic fallout.",2020-10-30 22:48:51-04:00,

In an Instagram Live interview with Washington Post reporter Geoff Edgers posted Sunday, Wallace, who moderated the debate, said he was “not fully conscious of the fact they weren’t wearing masks” because he was focused on his preparation.

“After I had the luxury to think about it, I was pissed off. That’s a technical phrase. I mean, did they think that the rules that applied to everybody else didn’t apply to them?” said Wallace. “I was upset when it turned out I’d been on the stage in a uniquely vulnerable position, and we found out 48 hours after the fact that the president had tested positive for the coronavirus.”

Just days after the Sept. 29 debate, the White House announced the president and first lady had tested positive for COVID-19. In the coming days, a number of White House aides also tested positive. The president spent three days at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Edgers also asked Wallace what he thought his father, the late venerated broadcast journalist Mike Wallace, would have thought of the chaotic presidential debate.

"Senate candidates focus closing arguments on health care, experience","Senate candidates are rolling out their closing ads of the 2020 campaign, with Democrats honing in on health care and Republicans promoting their own political profiles.

The final batch of ads is drawing attention to a cash gap between the parties, with Democratic candidates generally releasing two to three closing ads, while their Republican counterparts have tended to roll out one to two this cycle.

“The good news about these ads is that we will have a very expanded electorate,” said Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright. “There will be more voters in the pool.”

“These ads are going to reach people who have little to no voting history or maybe people who sat out elections before, traditionally those voters may not vote early,” Seawright added.

Democrats appear on track to gain seats and possible take the majority in the upper chamber. The party has honed in on a number of vulnerable incumbents, including in states long seen as Republican strongholds such as Texas and South Carolina.

“Something’s happening in South Carolina,” Davis says to images of people putting up Harrison signs. “Hope that things can get better. Faith that we can elect new leaders who put country before party.”

James also enlisted the services of a state celebrity, recruiting Michigan native and actor Tim Allen to narrate his closing ad released Thursday.

The 30 second spot titled “Together,” features shots of Michigan’s scenic landscapes, resembling one of Allen’s “Pure Michigan” tourism ads.

While some campaigns have yet to release their final closing messages, a number did so weeks ago in states including North Carolina.

“Well over half the votes are already cast,” said Todd, referring to the Tar Heel State. “You have to put your closing argument up two weeks out, you can’t wait until the last.”

The Senate campaign in North Carolina was rocked weeks ago by reports of Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham’s extramarital affair, giving Tillis and Republicans new material for ads late in the contest. Cunningham has led Tillis in most polling, but a recent New York Times-Siena College poll shows the Democrat up 3 points over the incumbent, while a Reuters Ipsos poll released this week shows Cunningham leading by one point.

Tillis's closing ad, titled “Code,” highlights the affair and includes narration from veterans condemning Cunningham, a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Reserve, for his actions.

“Veterans know we can’t trust Cal Cunningham,” says one veteran in the ad. “And North Carolina can’t trust Cal Cunningham in the Senate.”

Cunningham has touted his military service multiple times throughout his campaign, including his decision to enlist after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

He does so again in ad addressing the coronavirus pandemic, called “Run.”

“We’re being tested as a country, but Cal Cunningham has always run to the fight,” a narrator says in the spot.

Another ad titled “Battle Back,” addresses the need to build a stronger economy. The ads, which are set to run through Election Day, do not mention Tillis.

Colorado voters have been casting their ballots early by mail in October, meaning candidates in those races have rolled out their closing ads earlier as well.

But we have to stop the political games and remember what matters: helping people,"" Hickenlooper says in the 30-second spot.

Gardner is one of the most vulnerable incumbent Republican senators. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the race as “lean Democratic.”

The incumbent’s campaign juxtaposed clips of Gardner with old footage from a 1962 speech that former President John F. Kennedy gave in Pueblo, Colo., in which he called for funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

“It took 50 years to get it done, and it took Cory Gardner,” the narrator says in the ad titled “Next Generation.”

Todd said the ads depict Gardner as a “historically good senator bringing policy wins back for the state.”

However, Hickenlooper's campaign has tied Gardner to Trump in ads, hitting the senator for standing with Trump ""100 percent"" of the time in an ad released in October titled ""No Waver.""

Sen. Martha McSally Martha Elizabeth McSallyMore veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress Senate candidates focus closing arguments on health care, experience Senate battle threatens to spill into overtime MORE (Ariz.) is also seen as one of the most vulnerable incumbent Republicans. Cook rates her race against Democrat Mark Kelly as “lean Democratic.”

McSally’s campaign released two closing ads, both honing in on economic issues, claiming Kelly will raise taxes on working families.

“We need to help small businesses get back on their feet, cut taxes, and bring our jobs home from China,” she says in one of the ads. “Mark Kelly has a different plan. He’ll raise taxes on every mom stretching her family’s budget, and on every small business already struggling.”

Kelly’s closing ads take on a more personalized tone, with one featuring his wife, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). The ad shows Kelly and Giffords spending time together in their home.

“Marriage is a commitment to stand with your partner in sickness and in health,” says Giffords, who survived 2011 assassination attempt. “He has helped me through my darkest moments,” she later adds.

There is a question of how much campaigns' closing commercials will matter in the last few days leading up to the election, but strategists from both sides of the aisle agree that closing ads and messaging can play a role in turning the tide at the last minute for voters.

“There are people who are not typically that interested in politics, but they feel obligated to vote, so they begin to pay attention to politics at the very last minute before they have to vote,” Todd said. “They look for some cues and some guidance.”

Seawright said there is even a chance in the final stretch for voters to have second thoughts.

“There is a chance that their hearts can be changed,” he said. “I believe that if you can change somebody’s heart, you can get the mind to follow.”",2020-11-01 07:00:06-05:00,

Trump, who has appeared on the network dozens of times since taking office, pointed to the government’s coronavirus relief efforts and the recovering economy as evidence he is best suited to continue to lead the country.

""Thanks to my emergency economic relief legislation, more than 159 million Americans received direct financial assistance during the pandemic. Meanwhile, our Paycheck Protection Program helped protect 51 million American jobs, allocating over $525 billion in forgivable loans for over 5.2 million small businesses,"" Trump wrote.

""As a result of our efforts and the tremendous momentum of the pre-pandemic economy, we’re witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history,"" Trump added. ""The American economy grew at an annualized rate of 33.1 percent in the third quarter, another example of the economy beating expectations under my leadership. This is a new record for quarterly economic growth and is nearly double the previous record set 70 years ago.""

The dueling op-eds come as Fox News has been carrying campaign rally speeches and stops of both Trump and Biden in recent days, along with appearances by former President Obama.

Trump has criticized the network for giving Democrats air time, including for “playing Obama’s no crowd, fake speech.”

Fox News host Bret Baier pushed back on the air earlier this week.

“You’ve been watching President Trump in Salem, Wis., speaking for almost 42 minutes so far in front of another big crowd,” Baier said Tuesday evening. “We brought you his speech in Lansing, Mich., live earlier today. We also brought you live speeches from Joe Biden in both Warm Springs and Atlanta, Ga., and former President Obama’s speech in Orlando, Fla. All of those carried live on Fox News Channel earlier today.”

“It’s what we do to cover an important election fairly,” Baier continued. “Fair, balanced and unafraid. We are seven days from election night. We promise we are going to cover it all fairly and get in the news around the world in between the fast-moving political developments.”

Netflix raises prices for first time since January 2019,"Netflix is raising the price of its HD standard subscription by $1 to $13.99 per month, marking the first time the streaming giant has raised prices since January 2019.

The 4K premium subscription will jump from $15.99 to $17.99, according to an announcement on Thursday.

Netflix's $8.99 plan, which is not broadcast in high definition, will not see a price increase.

“We understand people have more entertainment choices than ever and we’re committed to delivering an even better experience for our members,” a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer more variety of TV shows and films – in addition to our great fall lineup. As always we offer a range of plans so that people can pick a price that works best for their budget.”

The increase comes after Netflix narrowly missed its projection for new subscribers in its third quarter earnings report.

The company still enjoyed a revenue increase of 25 percent amid the pandemic when compared to the same quarter in 2019, with revenue topping $6.15 billion and beating Wall Street estimates.

The coronavirus pandemic that shuttered movie theaters while keeping many Americans at home led to an explosion in new subscribers in the first quarter of the year, with Netflix adding a record 15.8 million accounts between January and the end of March alone.",2020-10-30 09:39:04-04:00,
One Million Moms accuses Uber of glamorizing 'LGBTQ lifestyle' for having 'Queer Eye' star in commercial,"The conservative group One Million Moms has accused UberEats “of glamorizing a LBGTQ lifestyle” over its new ad campaign featuring ""Queer Eye"" star Jonathan Van Ness.

The Christian group, which is a branch of the American Family Association, started a petition online to end the ad campaign, which has garnered more than 6,300 signatures thus far.

“Shame on Uber Eats for attempting to brainwash viewers with an agenda instead of focusing on providing a helpful service, especially during a pandemic,” the group wrote in the petition. “Instead of making audiences lose their appetite by glamorizing a LGBTQ lifestyle, Uber Eats should focus on what it does and remain neutral on controversial issues.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The group also said that casting Van Ness “screams liberal agenda"" and “turns off potential Uber Eats customers.”

The ad campaign features Van Ness, someone who identifies as non-binary but uses he/him pronouns, alongside Olympic gold medal gymnast Simone Biles.

One ad begins with Biles doing backflips before saying “tonight, I’ll be eating a cheesy cauliflower pizza with extra broccolini.”

“Anything Simone Biles can do, Jonathan Van Ness can do… in his own, amazing way,” the video’s caption on YouTube reads.

Another ad features Van Ness saying he’ll have a “falafel wrap with sweet potato fries.” After his order appears, Biles appears and says “splitsies?”

Van Ness then does a split on the balance beam that Biles is on.

“Oh, you meant the food, didn’t you?"" The reality star asks, jokingly.

In a statement to The Hill, a spokesperson for Uber said: “At Uber Eats, we’re unapologetically committed to representing the flavor spectrum. From tacos to talent, we like it spicy. JVN and Simone serve gymnastic prowess and self-confidence, qualities millions of moms everywhere can—and do—support.”

One Million Moms is known for pushing back on content featuring LGBT characters and stars. In December 2019, the Hallmark Channel pulled four TV ads that featured a lesbian couple getting married and kissing after a petition from the group received nearly 26,000 signatures.

Taylor drew widespread attention Wednesday after he came forward as the anonymous ""senior administration official"" behind an op-ed for the Times in 2018 that blasted Trump and sought to portray himself as part of a ""resistance"" in the government seeking to rein in the president's worst impulses.

The former Trump administration official, who had served as a chief of staff at DHS before leaving the agency last year, had denied being ""Anonymous"" when pressed in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper in August.

Cooper asked Taylor in the interview, “There was an op-ed, there was a book, by someone calling themselves ‘Anonymous.’ Are you aware of who that is?”

“I’m not,” Taylor replied. “That was a parlor game that happened in Washington, D.C., of a lot of folks trying to think of who that might be. I’ve got my own thoughts about who that might be —”

Turner was taken off the field before the eighth inning of Game 6 against the Tampa Bay Rays in Arlington, Texas, after his test was returned positive during the deciding game of the World Series and his team just six outs from ending a 32-year championship drought.

But after the Dodgers later recorded the final out in the team's 3-1 victory, Turner celebrated with teammates on the field, at times without a mask.

""Following the Dodgers' victory, it is clear that Turner chose to disregard the agreed-upon joint protocols and the instructions he was given regarding the safety and protection of others,"" MLB said in a Wednesday statement.

""While a desire to celebrate is understandable, Turner’s decision to leave isolation and enter the field was wrong and put everyone he came in contact with at risk. When MLB security raised the matter of being on the field with Turner, he emphatically refused to comply,"" it adds.

Turner shared Tuesday night on Twitter that he felt ""great"" and had ""no symptoms at all"" from the novel coronavirus.

""Thanks to everyone reaching out! I feel great, no symptoms at all. Just experienced every emotion you can possibly imagine. Can’t believe I couldn’t be out there to celebrate with my guys! So proud of this team & unbelievably happy for the City of LA,"" he wrote.

More than 40 Trump campaign signs were taken at locations across Passaic County this month, Hawthorne Mayor Richard Goldberg (R) told NJ.com on Friday.

“It’s not distressing, but it’s disappointing,” said Goldberg. “I don’t read this as some great conspiracy. Every election year signs are stolen, but this seems like a bit of an organized attempt — someone who’s not a fan of Trump wants to take them.”

The mayor added that campaign signs for local and county candidates were left undisturbed.

A police report was filed on Oct. 14 for the roughly 40 missing ""Trump 2020"" signs, the local outlet reported.

Police Lt. Robert King confirmed the signs amounted to a value of around $1,000, adding that authorities are investigating but have no suspects at this time.

Goldberg said when signs started going missing several weeks ago, he addressed the issue in his weekly coronavirus letter to residents.

""We asked residents to respect each other’s property,"" the mayor told NJ.com. ""Rather than take a sign, have a discussion and you’ll at least have a better idea of where the person is coming from.""

One Michigan campaign sign owner went as far as to build a booby trap around his ""Trump 2020"" sign, which resulted in a township employee slicing his hand when he attempted to remove it. The sign was reportedly in a location that violated city ordinances.

ABC-7 reported on Friday that a lawsuit was filed challenging Samaniego’s order, just one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) said on Twitter that his office was “quickly exploring all legal actions” over the order.

""As of this morning, we received a lawsuit, however until such time that a Court orders otherwise, my order still stands,” Samaniego said, according to ABC-7. “All businesses are required to follow my order. Any business in violation of my order can be cited.”

According to the El Paso Times, Samaniego ordered all nonessential businesses in El Paso County, such as in-person dining, gyms and salons, to shut down for two weeks.

Margo said on Twitter on Thursday that he sent a letter to Paxton asking him to weigh in on whether the city had to enforce the new order. He said that Samaniego “did not consult me and refuses to return my call” on the matter.

“What I can speak to is the hurt our community is going through,” Margo tweeted. ""We must strike a balance of keeping our neighbors safe while not destroying people’s abilities to feed their families.”

--> A midday take on what's happening in politics and how to have a sense of humor about it.*

*Ha. Haha. Hahah. Sniff. Haha. Sniff. Ha--breaks down crying hysterically.

The Hill’s 12:30 Report: Handful of pollsters predict secret Trump voters | Positive Trump polling stirs debate | Dems question Biden’s final week travel decisions | Texas results foreshadow state of the country | Trump changes election night plans | Biden’s rainy rally exactly 12 years after Obama’s | Kanye buys 2-page ad in NYT | Best Halloween costumes

T-MINUS 4 DAYS



OK, so what’s the deal with the polling? Most say Biden is ahead, but some say Trump is:

Via The Hill’s Jonathan Easley, “Most pollsters show Democratic nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE with a sturdy and stable lead over President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE at a time when tens of millions of people have already voted and there is almost no time to change the course of the race.” https://bit.ly/3eb8JuV

Yes, but… (!): “A handful of contrarian pollsters believe Trump’s support is underrepresented and that election analysts could be headed for another embarrassing miss on Election Day.”

From The Trafalgar Group, the only nonpartisan polling group to show Trump’s 2016 lead in Pennsylvania and Michigan: “Trafalgar’s Robert Cahaly says there is a hidden Trump vote that is not being accounted for in polls that show Biden on a glide path to the White House. ‘There are more [shy Trump voters] than last time and it’s not even a contest,’ Cahaly said, adding that it’s ‘quite possible’ that the polling industry is headed for a catastrophic miss in 2020.”

What we know: https://bit.ly/3eb8JuV





To put this into context — ‘Trump’s chances hinge on a polling screw-up way worse than 2016’:

Via Politico’s Steven Shepard, “President Donald Trump still has a path to a second term. But it would take a polling debacle that would make 2016 look like a banner year.” https://politi.co/37RGyA9

Where polling stands: “In most of the core swing states, Joe Biden has maintained a stable — though not overwhelming — lead over Trump in polls over the past few months, continuing into the final week of the election. Some of the state polling averages have tightened slightly since the last debate, though Biden remains consistently ahead. In three live-interview polls of Florida all released on Thursday, Biden led Trump by between 3 and 5 points.”

For context (!): “It’s not impossible, but you have to squint to see how Biden’s lead won’t hold up on Election Day. Even signs that were more apparent four years ago — whether in real-time or in retrospect — are more ambiguous this year.”





SPEAKING OF POLLING — HERE’S A NEW POLL SHOWING BIDEN LEADING IN A FEW KEY STATES:

Via The Hill’s Julia Manchester, “Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leads President Trump in the swing states of North Carolina, Florida and Pennsylvania less than a week out from Election Day, according to a new Hill/Harris battleground poll.” The numbers: https://bit.ly/37Rkyp3

Texas is a state that will tell us A LOT about the state of the country:

Via The Hill’s Niall Stanage, “The result of the presidential election in Texas will say a lot about where American politics is right now — and where it’s headed. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden carries the state, President Trump is on his way to a landslide defeat.” https://bit.ly/3oHaftG

It doesn’t even have to be a landslide to be interesting: “If the result is even close, the Lone Star State will be flashing a bright warning sign for the GOP, especially when it comes to the electoral downside of Trump’s approach, including his hard-line rhetoric on immigration.”

And if Trump wins easily in Texas: “It will be a sign that many important parts of the country remain out of reach for Democrats.”

ON THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN TRAIL



I believe we call this ‘nervous energy’:

Via The Hill’s Amie Parnes, “Democrats are largely confident about Joe Biden's chances of winning the White House, but are second-guessing some decisions the Democratic nominee’s campaign made with his late travel schedule.”https://bit.ly/3kO9nRO

For example: “The backseat driving includes criticism of the campaign's decision to send Biden to red-state Georgia on Tuesday instead of focusing on a must-win state like Michigan or Wisconsin. Biden's running mate Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden begins two-day campaign sprint in battleground Pennsylvania Trump praises Texas supporters who surrounded Biden-Harris bus FBI investigating Biden bus surrounded by pro-Trump cars: report MORE (D-Calif.) is also headed to Texas on Friday, where she will make three stops across the state.”

Cue Salt ‘n’ Peppa please — ‘Let’s talk about fund-rais-ing, lets’s talk about you and the GOP:

Via The Hill’s Jordain Carney, “Republicans are facing a post-election reckoning about how they cultivate small-dollar donors.” https://bit.ly/2TDcb8e

How so: “Regardless of who wins on Nov. 3, GOP lawmakers and officials say there needs to be a party-wide discussion about how to better fundraise as the coronavirus pandemic magnifies the importance of digital efforts at a time when in-person events are dramatically scaled back.”

ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL



Election night could be a bit messy:

Via The Hill’s Reid Wilson, “President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s hostility toward mail-in voting in the midst of a global pandemic and a new U.S. Supreme Court decision blocking extended ballot deadlines in a battleground state have election officials worried that two branches of government are undermining confidence in an election Trump is poised to lose.” https://bit.ly/31VTX6i

“Trump has increasingly demanded on Twitter that results be known on Election Night, a ploy apparently designed to exclude millions of people who vote by mail and whose ballots may not be counted immediately even if they arrive long before the polls close.”

What could happen: https://bit.ly/31VTX6i





TRUMP FIGHTS FOR BATTLGROUND ARIZONA:

https://bit.ly/2HBOGdu





WHY BIDEN COULD ACTUALLY WIN TEXAS:

https://bit.ly/31Q0sHJ





Interesting read — 50 percent is no longer the magic number:

Via Politico’s David Siders and Zach Montellaro, “Donald Trump won the presidency with 46 percent of the popular vote. His approval rating, according to Gallup, has never hit 50 percent. He remains under 50 percent in national polling averages.” https://politi.co/3oNA8Iq

What this means: “The president’s inability to capture a majority of support sheds light on his extraordinary attempts to limit the number of votes cast across the battleground state map — a massive campaign-within-a-campaign to maximize Trump’s chances of winning a contest in which he’s all but certain to earn less than 50 percent of the vote.”

A few examples: “In Philadelphia, his campaign is videotaping voters as they return ballots. In Nevada, it’s suing to force elections officials in Nevada’s Democratic-heavy Clark County to more rigorously examine ballot signatures for discrepancies that could disqualify them.” There are similar examples in Ohio, New Hampshire and Arizona.

^And that’s just to name a few of the efforts.

Why this matters: https://politi.co/3oNA8Iq

NEWS THIS MORNING



Some good news for the economy:

Via The Hill’s Sylvan Lane, “The U.S. economy grew at a record 33.1 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, swiftly recovering some of the deep losses driven by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data released Thursday by the Commerce Department.” https://bit.ly/2TxjmPc

For context: “Economists had widely expected gross domestic product (GDP) to rebound at an unprecedented rate in the third quarter as the U.S. began to dig itself out of the coronavirus recession. The U.S. added 3.8 million jobs between July and September and saw sharp increases in consumer spending, particularly on personal goods household products.”





IN CONGRESS

Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE has once again handed off the baton:

House Dems are hoping the wave is blue:

Via The Hill’s Mike Lillis and Scott Wong, “Not too long ago, the notion that [House] Democrats would expand their majority in any significant fashion was virtually unthinkable. In January of 2019, at the start of the cycle, the party's campaign arm was bracing to protect dozens of vulnerable lawmakers in red-leaning regions, 30 of whom represent districts won by President Trump in 2016.” https://bit.ly/3mAXq2m

Yes, but now: “Twenty-two months later they're on the offensive, buoyed by a historic fundraising haul, a highly energized base and President Trump’s sinking approval numbers, which have combined to produce highly competitive races even deep into Trump country.”

What to expect: https://bit.ly/3mAXq2m





Meanwhile, it’s possible that Republicans keep the Senate:

Via The Hill’s Alexander Bolton, “Republicans see a path running through Michigan and Minnesota to hold a slim Senate majority in the next Congress. The odds are stacked against them and many see the GOP as the underdog in the fight for control of the Senate.” https://bit.ly/31PrmQ8

The scenario for the GOP: “But Republicans think that even if as many as four GOP incumbents go down in defeat next week, they can keep their majority by ousting Sen.

The statute: The “1996 statute known as Section 230 … shields online companies from lawsuits for hosting, taking down or otherwise moderating user content.” Here’s a good breakdown from Politico’s Cristiano Lima: https://politi.co/37P3EqU

Where the three executives stand: Facebook is willing to update their policies, while Twitter and Google are a little more hesitant to make changes. https://politi.co/37P3EqU

The argument for keeping the statute as is: The platforms would constantly worry about the legal liability of posts and would over censor content to avoid penalties. That could violate free speech.

The argument for updating or removing the statute: The platforms lack incentives to properly police third party content.

ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL



Trump rally attendees were stuck in the cold because of a bus issue:

Via The Washington Post’s Tim Elfrink, “By the time President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE finished speaking to thousands of supporters at Omaha’s Eppley Airfield on Tuesday night … the temperature had plunged to nearly freezing. But as long lines of MAGA-clad attendees queued up for buses to take them to distant parking lots, it quickly became clear something was wrong.”

What happened: “The buses, the huge crowd soon learned, couldn’t navigate the jammed airport roads. For hours, attendees — including many elderly Trump supporters — stood in the cold, as police scrambled to help those most at-risk get to warmth.”

At least seven people were taken to local hospitals.

Why both campaigns are giving Florida a lot of love: “Polls show a tight race between Trump and Biden in the Sunshine State, with the Real Clear Politics average of polls putting the president with a mere 0.4 percentage point advantage over his Democratic challenger. A Florida Atlantic University poll released on Tuesday — one week before Election Day — showed Biden with a 2 percentage point advantage over Trump, a result within the margin of error.”

What we know, from The Hill’s Tal Axelrod and Amie Parnes: https://bit.ly/34yiz74





T-MINUS 6 DAYS



Remember the secret Trump voters that were hard to poll in 2016?:

There might be secret Biden voters this time around. Via The Hill’s Amie Parnes, “Political observers say there is a group of voters that has emerged in this cycle: Republicans who have never supported a Democratic candidate — not for the city council, Congress or president — who suddenly find themselves set to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. And they don’t want anyone to know it.” https://bit.ly/37OvhAH

Refresher from 2016: “In 2016, some strategists concluded that a number of voters were secretly voting for Donald Trump but were not getting picked up by pollsters.”

Where that could help Biden’s campaign: “States such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, but also other states Democrats lost to Trump in 2016, such as Iowa, North Carolina and Georgia, where the vice president visited on Tuesday.”





NEW NUMBERS:

In Wisconsin: Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump by 17 (!) points, according to a new ABC News-Washington Post poll. The numbers: https://bit.ly/2TtOVcR

Cook moves Texas from ‘lean Republican’ to ‘toss-up’: The nonpartisan Cook Political Report moved the traditionally Republican state of Texas to “toss-up.” Why: “Polling in the state shows Democratic nominee Joe Biden closing the margin with President Trump, who won [Texas] by 9 points in over Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE in 2016. According to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Trump holds a 2.6 point lead in the state.” https://bit.ly/3kDd0Ka

Op-ed: Here’s an argument for why the polls could be wrong again, meaning President Trump could win again: https://bit.ly/35LiLzj

Stocks dropped this morning:

“Stocks opened with steep losses Wednesday amid growing fears that rising COVID-19 cases and the lack of a stimulus agreement between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats will force more U.S. cities to close or restrict businesses.” https://bit.ly/34ydRGn

The numbers: “The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened with a loss of more than 570 points, falling 2 percent as the market opened. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 each fell roughly 1.8 percent.”

ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL



A week from now and people WILL BE VOTING. And it won’t be early voting anymore!:

Election Day is one week from today. Eeeek!

Where the polling stands: Via The Hill’s Jonathan Easley, “Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s polling lead over President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE is holding steady in a significant shift from 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE saw her lead fall in the week before Election Day.” https://bit.ly/37LN4bu

Why the polling *might be* a little more accurate this time: “All of the factors that pollsters measure to analyze volatility among likely voters — the number of undecideds, those considering third-party candidates and leaners who could still change their minds — are down at this point in 2020 compared to in 2016, keeping the race at a steady level that favors Biden in the home stretch.”

Compared to 2016: “At this point in 2016, the polls had begun to tighten significantly, even if many analysts ignored it.”





NUMBERS TO KNOW:

According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump by 7.4 points. https://bit.ly/3msTIaI

More than 60 million Americans have already voted. That already tops the total number of early votes in 2016. https://cnn.it/31N03WR

INTERESTING READ — ‘HOW EARLY VOTING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE POLLS’:

“A side effect of high turnout is that it has the potential for making the polls more accurate as well. A lot of problems in polling can come from trying to figure out which voters are more likely to actually turn out and vote … It's easier to know if someone is a registered voter than if they're a likely voter. If turnout is higher, the likely voter universe has a better chance of matching the registered voter universe.” Via CNN’s Harry Enten: https://cnn.it/3msJYgC





I SUGGEST READING THIS AND PASSING THIS AROUND — IF YOU’RE AT ALL SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE VOTING PROCESS, THIS IS A HELPFUL Q&A:

Via Politico’s Zach Montellaro and Tim Alberta: https://politi.co/34uBhMJ

Including answers to: “Isn’t it true that ballots have been mass-mailed out to everyone?” and “why are so many people suddenly being allowed to vote by mail?”





IF TRUMP CAN WIN FLORIDA AND PENNSVYLANIA, HE HAS A STRONG CHANCE OF WINNING ANOTHER TERM:

“Such an outcome is not implausible even though Trump is behind in polls in both states. Trump has higher hopes in Florida where Biden leads by under 2 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics polling average. In Pennsylvania, Biden’s lead is around 5 points.” The full reasoning from The Hill’s Niall Stanage: https://bit.ly/37KafTC

Barrett will be quickly thrown in:

Via Bloomberg’s Greg Stohr, “Justice Amy Coney Barrett will immediately be embroiled in some of the nation’s biggest legal battles, including cases that could determine whether the president who nominated her gets four more years in the White House.”

Oh and: She “will take part when the court hears a challenge to the Affordable Care Act a week after the election.” https://bloom.bg/2G2pcF6

HAPPENING TODAY



An in-person White House celebration? For Amy Coney Barrett? Why does this seem familiar?:

Following the Senate’s scheduled vote for Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE is planning to hold a swearing-in ceremony, potentially this evening, at the White House. https://bit.ly/35AL4jz

From White House chief of staff Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsSunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day Biden and Trump closing arguments diverge sharply on COVID-19 Democrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' MORE: ""We’re doing... the best we can to encourage as much social distancing as possible. It’ll be outdoors if it goes off as planned right now. And still continue to do testing in and around those that are critical to the mission to try to get there.""

The white elephant in the room: The Rose Garden ceremony for Barrett has been widely criticized as a source of the White House’s coronavirus outbreak.

Why Meadows says this event is different: ""The very first event, while there’s a whole lot of connects that have been made with who was at the event and who came down with it, we’ve been able to look at that and track as many as three different areas where the virus actually infected different people within the White House. So it didn’t all come from that particular event.""

ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL



Trump tries to weave his path to 270:

Via The Hill’s Brett Samuels and Julia Manchester, “[President Trump] and his campaign see a path to victory that resembles his surprise 2016 win, but an array of factors have combined to make it a more challenging climb to 270 electoral votes.” https://bit.ly/3miWWNS

Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s goal: Close any path for Trump in the final week.

Where Biden stands: “Polls released last week showed [Joe Biden] leading in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. There does not appear to be meaningful support for a third-party candidate in those states, where Trump won by narrow margins four years ago.”

Where Trump stands: “The president’s campaign believes it still has a chance to flip Minnesota and Nevada, but Trump’s travel schedule reflects a less ambitious electoral map. He spent the weekend in Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Ohio and New Hampshire. He has been to Florida and North Carolina three times each in the last two weeks, underscoring their importance to his path to reelection.

How converting a few of those non voters could be huge: “Not voting has been a feature of the American political landscape for decades. But with razor slim margins in a number of swing states last time, nonvoters have taken on an outsize importance: Even a small victory in converting some of them may tip the scales. For example in Pennsylvania: https://nyti.ms/2HEa9Ce

The Hill's 12:30 Report — Presented by the Walton Family Foundation — Sights and sounds from the final debate,"Presented by the Walton Family Foundation

TALK OF THE MORNING



Well this was a little bit less of an angry bickering match, so I’m going to call it a win for everyone:

Well, congratulations! We made it through the debates between President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE. Last night’s clash was most notable for its more measured, orderly tone, but still included an array of attacks.

I’d like to take a moment to thank the two MVPs of the night: the first being debate moderator Kristen Welker, who did a fantastic job, and No. 2, the muting feature on the microphones.

How the shift in tone defined last night’s debate: https://bit.ly/2Tx7f4V

What’s next: A final sprint for both campaigns in the last 10 days before Election Day. The Trump campaign is dividing and conquering in Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio today. Biden is delivering remarks today in Delaware on the pandemic, and his running mate, Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden begins two-day campaign sprint in battleground Pennsylvania Trump praises Texas supporters who surrounded Biden-Harris bus FBI investigating Biden bus surrounded by pro-Trump cars: report MORE, is campaigning in Atlanta.





TAKEAWAYS:





Trump changed his tone: “Trump was mostly on his best behavior Thursday night.”

Both candidates landed punches : “For any remaining undecided voters, it was tough to see either man as obviously dominant.”

Trump goes after Biden’s family : “The president … eagerly pivoted to Biden’s family no matter the topic that was given to him.”

Kristen Welker shone as moderator : “The moderators this presidential debate season have not had a good time — until Thursday night.”

Did Trump do enough? : “The president’s performance will win him praise … But whether Trump did enough to change the tide of the presidential race is very much in doubt.”

ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL



Interesting read on what to make of this year’s polling:

In The New Yorker, Sue Halpern looks into whether we can trust the polls this time. https://bit.ly/3ognG3A

Excerpt: “If 2016 taught us anything, it’s that national polls are deceptive. Clinton was projected to beat Trump in the popular vote by about three percentage points, which turned out to be largely correct. But … a better way to assess a candidate’s chances is to look at polls of voters in battleground states, where, ultimately, the race will be determined.”

Have you noticed the subtle power shift on Capitol Hill?:

Via The Hill’s Alexander Bolton, “A subtle power shift is emerging on Capitol Hill as Republicans face a possible future that might no longer include President Trump. The shift has been most apparent in the dynamics surrounding negotiations on a new coronavirus relief package.” https://bit.ly/37xDkSk

How so: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.) has sought to avoid a vote on a massive stimulus package that would badly divide the Senate GOP conference right before Election Day, even as Trump urges Republican senators to ‘go big.’”

NEWS OF THE MORNING



The pope supports same-sex unions:

Via The New York Times’s Jason Horowitz, “Pope Francis, who since the beginning of his pontificate has taken a more tolerant tone toward homosexuality, appeared to break with the position of the Roman Catholic Church by supporting civil unions for same-sex couples, according to remarks Francis made in a new documentary that debuted in Rome on Wednesday.” https://nyti.ms/3meQgAF

In Pope Francis’s words, via the Catholic News Agency: “Homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family. They’re children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it.” https://bit.ly/3o6PQxM

And when asked directly about civil unions: “What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered. I stood up for that.”

ALSO THIS MORNING

The company that makes OxyContin pleaded guilty:

Via The Hill’s Nathaniel Weixel, “Purdue Pharma, the company that manufactures the powerful opioid OxyContin, will plead guilty to three federal charges as part of a larger $8 billion settlement arrangement, the Justice Department said Wednesday.” https://bit.ly/2HmwmnZ

The felony charges: The charges “[include] conspiracy to defraud the United States, and two counts of conspiracy to violate anti-kickback laws.

Keep in mind about the drug: “OxyContin has been widely blamed for starting the country’s opioid crisis, which has killed more than 400,000 Americans over the past two decades.”

A MESSAGE FROM THE WALTON FAMILY FOUNDATION

ON THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TRAIL



Biden lapped Trump in cash:

Via Politico’s Elena Schneider and Zach Montellaro, “Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s campaign outraised [President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s] by an eye-catching $200 million in September and started October with $177 million in the bank. That's a nearly 3-to-1 edge over Trump’s $63 million, putting Trump at a deficit without parallel in the modern era of campaign financing, especially for a sitting president.” https://politi.co/35dgdcE

For context: “The last incumbent to face reelection, Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaA wave election? Or a fundamental realigning of American politics? If it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Pittsburgh newspaper backs Trump in first GOP presidential endorsement since 1972 MORE, had nearly $100 million left to spend at this point in 2012, while his challenger, Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday The looming battle over Latino voters Arizona: On the fast track to swing state status MORE, had almost exactly the amount Trump has left this year.”





IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE RACES



Please, talk about policy.:

Via The Hill’s Jordain Carney, “Republicans are urging President Trump to focus on policy — not personality fights — in the final two weeks before the election.” https://bit.ly/37smq7y

Why it’s so important in the final stretch: “As the president and several key incumbents trail in the polls, GOP senators are urging him to dial down the personal attacks and focus on his agenda in a last-ditch attempt to appeal to swing voters by emphasizing the policy differences between a potential Trump second term and a Biden administration.”

Timing: “Their pleas come ahead of a final debate between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden this week and as the president has appeared eager to home in on Biden’s son Hunter Biden, a move some GOP senators and strategists warn could backfire.”

Examples of Republican senators pleading with Trump to focus on policy, not personal attacks: https://bit.ly/37smq7y

Op-ed: https://bit.ly/31ta0sg

Meanwhile in the House — one of the biggest battlegrounds in a decade:

Via The Hill’s Reid Wilson from Glendale, Ariz., Democrats and Republicans are fighting over the largest House battlefield in a decade. https://bit.ly/3ofGtvJ

How so: “The four most prominent groups paying for advertising in House races are targeting 31 seats held by Democratic incumbents and 30 seats held by Republicans, according to the nonpartisan firm Advertising Analytics. Those seats stretch from the Alaskan tundra to the beaches of South Florida, from Orange County to rural Maine and seemingly everywhere in between.”

IN CONGRESS



To even say they are ‘inching’ closer to a deal would be overstating it:

HAPPENING ON THURSDAY



*Insert stereotypical heaven doors opening music*

There will be a mic-muting feature at Thursday’s debate!:

The Commission on Presidential Debates has approved a new rule to mute the microphones of President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE when one is speaking. https://bit.ly/3jb7GvP

From the commission: “Both campaigns this week again reaffirmed their agreement to the two-minute, uninterrupted rule. The Commission is announcing today that in order to enforce this agreed upon rule, the only candidate whose microphone will be open during these two-minute periods is the candidate who has the floor under the rules.”





ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL



We will allow exactly three extra days:

Via The New York Times’s Adam Liptak, The Supreme Court ruled that Pennsylvania election officials will count ballots received up to three days after the Nov. 3 election. https://nyti.ms/3dMw0TJ

Keep in mind: Pennsylvania is a major battleground state (!)

How the Supreme Court made the ruling: Well, technically, the court ruled 4-4, meaning the lower court’s ruling stands.

Reasoning from the lower court: “The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the three-day extension was required by the coronavirus pandemic and delays in mail service, and it ordered the counting of ballots clearly mailed on or before Election Day and of those with missing or illegible postmarks ‘unless a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that it was mailed after Election Day.’ ”

Keep in mind: This is seen as a win for Democrats.

Hello and welcome to ‘The Hunter Show!’:

In an interview with “Fox & Friends” this morning, President Trump called for Attorney General William Barr Bill BarrWhy it's time for a majority female Cabinet Trump administration pressured federal prosecutors to settle investigation into Turkish bank: report DOJ shifts, will allow local police to wear body cameras during operations with federal agents MORE to investigate Hunter Biden, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s son, demanding that the findings be released before Election Day. https://bit.ly/2IGOoSw

In Trump’s words: “We have got to get the attorney general to act. He’s got to act and he’s got to act fast … This is major corruption and this has to be known about before the election.”

Why this is particularly newsy: “Trump’s remarks represented an extraordinary effort by the president to push a member of his Cabinet to investigate the family of his political opponent, as he explicitly invoked the election as reason to do so. They came after a group of House Republicans asked Barr to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations about Hunter Biden made in the Post last week.”





Joe Biden has been staying in the background — and it seems to be working?:

Via The Hill’s Niall Stanage, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is staying slow and steady in the face of criticism. https://bit.ly/2IPb4QL

How so — Biden is getting criticized from all sides : “Biden comes under constant criticism from President Trump’s campaign for his low-wattage public schedule. Earlier, during the Democratic primary battle, left-wing critics contended he was uninspiring. In media circles, Biden’s center-left politics and old-school approach often get met with a collective shoulder-shrug.”

Yes, but: “Yet, for all that, the 77-year-old former vice president is on the cusp of what would be the ultimate validation. He is a significant distance ahead of Trump in national polls and has an edge in almost all the battleground states with just two weeks left until Election Day.”





INTERESTING READ — ‘HE’S 32. HE’S JOE BIDEN’S PRESS SECRETARY. AND HE HAS STAGE 4 CANCER:

Via Washingtonian’s Luke Mullins, “TJ Ducklo found out what it’s like to work a presidential campaign while you’re battling a devastating personal health crisis.” The full story: https://bit.ly/2IIYGS5

A MESSAGE FROM THE WALTON FAMILY FOUNDATION





NEWS THIS MORNING



Well, let’s hear it:

Via The Hill’s John Kruzel, “The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to review a pair of disputes over Trump administration immigration policies, including the president’s diversion of military funds to build a wall along the United States' southern border and a policy requiring asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases proceed through American courts.” https://bit.ly/3o2sXeW

Why the timing will be noteworthy: “The cases are expected to be heard sometime after the anticipated confirmation of President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s third justice, Amy Coney Barrett, and are likely to present the first major legal confrontation over Trump immigration policy to the 6-3 conservative majority court.”





ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL



Don’t fall into the ‘it’s over, Biden will win’ trap:

Via Politico’s David Siders, “By almost every measure that political operatives, academics and handicappers use to forecast elections, the likely outcome is that Joe Biden will win the White House … Yet two weeks before Election Day, the unfolding reality of 2020 is that it’s harder than ever to be sure. And Democrats are scrambling to account for the hidden variables that could still sink their nominee — or what you might call the known unknowns.” https://politi.co/3ke16WK

Think: Turnout, both for in-person voting and early voting, and rejected mail-in ballots

Here are “the hidden factors that could produce a surprise Trump victory”: https://politi.co/3ke16WK

Why tonight’s debate was canceled: The Commission on Presidential Debates had made today’s debate virtual after President Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. After some back and forth, the debate was canceled.

How the town halls were planned: Shortly after the debate was canceled, the Biden campaign quickly scheduled a town hall event for this evening. The Trump campaign then agreed to its own competing town hall event.

What to expect ratings-wise — I’d rather be Trump than Biden tonight: “Trump’s town hall is almost certain to win a larger audience than Biden’s. The event will be simulcast on both MSNBC and CNBC, while Biden’s town hall will only be broadcast on ABC.”

When is the next — and last — presidential debate: A week from today, Oct. 22.

Keep in mind about the Thursday vote: “For the committee vote on Oct. 22, in addition to needing two members of the minority, a majority of the committee — 12 senators — must be present to send Barrett's nomination to the floor. Republicans hold a 12-10 majority on the committee, meaning they can meet that on their own if every GOP senator is present.” https://bit.ly/2IykS1o

And assuming Barrett’s nomination advances on Oct. 22: Her final Senate confirmation vote would likely happen on Oct. 29.

HAPPENING ON CAPITOL HILL



Day 3: Same room, same seats, roughly the same debates, basically the same quips … slightly different outfits:

Senators on the Judiciary Committee are questioning Judge Amy Coney Barrett again today for her confirmation to the Supreme Court.

Today’s hearing livestream: https://bit.ly/3iS4dCo

What next after the questioning?: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamSenate candidates focus closing arguments on health care, experience Sunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day Ocasio-Cortez responds to Lindsey Graham debate swipe: You folded 'like a wet napkin' MORE scheduled a committee vote for 9 a.m. Thursday, Oct. 15, the morning of the last day of hearings. Barrett’s nomination is expected to be brought up for a vote at that meeting and then delayed for a week, per committee rules.” https://bit.ly/3nRnLKU

Timing: “If that happens as expected, the GOP-led committee would then vote to approve her nomination Thursday, Oct. 22. That would set up a final confirmation vote on the Senate floor the week of Oct. 26.” What we know about timing from the Associated Press: https://bit.ly/3nRnLKU





FROM THE HEARING:

Senators press Barrett on the fate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA): https://bit.ly/2H5X0Bi

On whether a president could pardon his or her self: “Amy Coney Barrett says to Leahy she can’t answer whether the President has an absolute right to pardon himself. Says it hasn’t been tested in court and it’s a question that calls for legal analysis. ‘It’s not one in which I can offer a view.’” https://bit.ly/375kim3

A question from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): ""You're not aware of any effort to go back to the good old days of segregation by a legislative body, is that correct?"" Video: https://bit.ly/2STeq6Z

On the president following a court order: “’Do you agree a president must follow a court order and the Supreme Court’s word is final?’ Leahy asks. Barrett says she agrees no one is above the law, SCOTUS has final word but has no ability to force compliance. ‘The Supreme Court can’t control whether a President obeys.’ ” (Via CNN’s Manu Raju) https://bit.ly/316ChVa

ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL



Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s strategy — run out the clock:

Via The Hill’s Amie Parnes, “Team Biden knows they’re ahead against President Trump, with national polls showing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden above the 50 percent mark. And with under three weeks to go until Election Day, the campaign has been doing just enough to keep things where they are as the clock ticks down to Nov. 3.” https://bit.ly/33Xw1AX

What the Biden campaign has been up to: “In recent weeks, Biden has been traveling more than he had earlier in the pandemic — making short trips to key battleground states as he did on Tuesday when he traveled to Florida — but his campaign has usually limited events to one speech a day. Those speeches are largely the same and his campaign has all but avoided long-ranging, sit-down national interviews where he could be asked a prickly question.”





JOE BIDEN IS HAVING A PRETTY EASY TIME AS THE NOMINEE:

Via Axios’s Mike Allen and Hans Nichols, “Since Aug. 31, Biden has answered less than half as many questions from the press as Trump — 365 compared with 753 — according to a tally by the Trump campaign, which the Biden campaign didn't dispute.” https://bit.ly/3duXXQ2

Why this is the case: “The media's obsession with Trump — and Trump's compulsion to dominate the news — allowed Biden to purposely and persistently minimize public appearances and tough questions.”

The full story — it’s pretty interesting: https://bit.ly/34VJEQC





If you put on those reading glasses and focus on Trump’s campaign schedule:

Via The Hill’s Niall Stanage, President Trump’s campaign schedule in the last weeks before the election reveals his weaknesses in battleground states. https://bit.ly/376ZXge

For example: “Trump will travel to Iowa for a rally Wednesday and to Georgia, as well as Florida, on Friday. Trump carried Iowa by more than 9 percentage points against Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE in 2016, while no Democrat has won Georgia in a presidential election since former President Clinton in 1992.”

Why that’s important: “The fact that those states are competitive is a warning sign about the president’s chances.”

Timing: “The travel decisions come at the same time as speculation mounts about the financial health of the president’s campaign. According to recent reports, the Trump campaign has pulled $17 million of planned ad spending from Iowa, New Hampshire and Ohio.” https://bit.ly/376ZXge





LATEST WITH THE CORONAVIRUS

Coronavirus cases in the U.S.: 7,860,452

U.S. death toll: 215,971

Breakdown of the numbers: https://cnn.it/2UAgW3y

For context: A month ago today, 6,521,887 Americans had tested positive for the coronavirus and 194,107 had died. https://bit.ly/3nOl4K3





Small gatherings aren’t great for the spread of COVID-19:

Via The Hill’s Jessie Hellmann, “Small gatherings are increasingly becoming a source of COVID-19 infection around the country, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield warned governors on a call Tuesday.” https://bit.ly/33ZLu3I

In Redfield’s words: “In the public square, we're seeing a higher degree of vigilance and mitigation steps in many jurisdictions … But what we're seeing as the increasing threat right now is actually acquisition of infection through small household gatherings. Particularly with Thanksgiving coming up, we think it's really important to stress the vigilance of these continued mitigation steps in the household setting."" https://bit.ly/33ZLu3I

Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s Supreme Court nominee, is facing a marathon of questions today from senators on the Judiciary Committee.

How long each senator will have for questions: 30 minutes https://cbsn.ws/310YGmV

Today’s hearing livestream: https://cs.pn/2SRlaSM





FROM THE HEARING:

Barrett on whether a president can delay an election — *cough,* I wonder why this hypothetical question was posed: ""If that question ever came before me, I would need to hear arguments from the litigants and read briefs...If I give off-the-cuff answers, then I would be basically a legal pundit.” Video of her response: https://bit.ly/2GLb8jW

Dianne Feinstein Dianne Emiel FeinsteinPence seeks to lift GOP in battle for Senate McConnell and Schumer's relationship shredded after court brawl Murkowski predicts Barrett won't overturn Roe v. Wade MORE (D-Calif.) said to Barrett, ""It's distressing not to get a straight answer. So let me try again. Do you agree with Justice Scalia's view that Roe was wrongly decided?"" Barrett responded: ""Senator, I completely understand why you are asking the question, but again I can't pre-commit or say yes."" Watch the full back and forth: https://bit.ly/2Ilm87L

On George Floyd: “Sen Durbin: What impact did the George Floyd video have on you? Barrett: ‘Given that I have two black children, that was very, very personal for my family.’ She says she and her [17 year-old] daughter Vivian, who was adopted from Haiti, ‘wept together.’"" (Via PBS's Yamiche Alcindor) https://bit.ly/3727I6M

On the process for cases: ""Judges can't just wake up one day and say 'I have an agenda. I like guns. I hate guns. I like abortion. I hate abortion.' and walk in like a royal queen and impose their will on the world."" Watch: https://bit.ly/312hrGs

On the late Justice Antonin Scalia: “Amy Coney Barrett says Antonin Scalia was a mentor to her but if she's confirmed, ‘You wouldn't be getting Justice Scalia, you would be getting Justice Barrett.’"" https://bit.ly/36ZmJX0

NEWS THIS MORNING



Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday The looming battle over Latino voters Arizona: On the fast track to swing state status MORE is telling everyone to CHILL:

In a tweet this morning, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) is urging political leaders to “lower the heat” in American politics.

Excerpt: “I’m troubled by our politics, as it has moved away from spirited debate to a vile, vituperative, hate-filled morass that is unbecoming of any free nation … The rapid attacks kindle the conspiracy mongers and the haters who take the small and predictable step from intemperate world to dangerous action.”

Romney’s message to political leaders: “It is time to lower the heat. Leaders must tone it down.”

Read Romney’s full message: https://bit.ly/313fWI3





ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL



Whoa, the ‘L’ word is being used:

Via The Hill’s Niall Stanage, “A landslide victory for Joe Biden is now a realistic possibility.” https://bit.ly/2GSrp6w

How so: “[Biden] has a lead of around 10 percentage points over President Trump in national polling averages, and he is up across almost all the battleground states. Trump faces low job approval ratings, bad marks for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and an ever-decreasing number of opportunities to change the direction of the race.”

The debates can change things, but: “The first debate has come and gone, and the second scheduled clash has been canceled. Only one more debate, set for Oct. 22, remains.”

Putting this into context: “No challenger to an incumbent president since Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday A wave election? Or a fundamental realigning of American politics? Davis: 5 questions for Trump voters MORE almost 30 years ago has been in such a strong position as Biden with such a short period of time until Election Day.”

What to know about this: https://bit.ly/2GSrp6w

Op-ed: https://bit.ly/37ezdKP





What do you mean, *insert air quotes* ‘poll watchers?’:

Via The Hill’s Julia Manchester, “Concern over voter intimidation is growing among Democrats and some observers as the Trump campaign calls for poll watchers to be dispatched across the country.” https://bit.ly/3lNDk4x

Back story: “President Trump's reelection campaign argues that poll watchers are essential in combating voter fraud, despite a number of studies failing to find widespread evidence of voter fraud at polling sites or by mail. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden over the weekend suggested that voter intimidation could result in him losing the election.”

Welcome, Amy! You’re going to hate it here.:

Three weeks before Election Day, President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, is beginning her four-day hearing on her nomination to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Ruth Bader GinsburgThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law Ginsburg's granddaughter cuts election ad for progressive group: 'Make her voice heard at the ballot box' The truth, the whole truth about protecting preexisting conditions MORE.

The goal of Democrats: To tie Judge Barrett to President Trump on the Affordable Care Act. https://bit.ly/310N5nP

The gist of the hearing:

“Democrats: This hearing is rushed, COVID is a problem, and Barrett will jeopardize your health care.""

""Republicans: Barrett is Catholic and that shouldn’t be an issue here. Also she’s qualified, and we’re allowed to hold this hearing.” (From The San Francisco Chronicle’s Tal Kopan) https://bit.ly/3jVhpaT

Spoiler alert — what will likely happen: “Regardless of what happens at the hearings, it’s expected that all 10 Democrats on the committee will oppose Barrett and that the 12 Republicans will support her. Barring surprises, Barrett is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate.” https://cnb.cx/3jQl8qn

A primer on Judge Barrett, from the New York Times: https://nyti.ms/34Jyw9g

Hearing livestream: https://cs.pn/352HKhd





FROM THE HEARING:

Barrett on the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: ""I have been nominated to fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat, but no one will ever take her place. I will be forever grateful for the path she marked and the life she led.”

Barrett thinks the judiciary branch should not make policy: “Courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life,” she said in her opening statement. “The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the People. The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try.” https://bit.ly/30XPvUi

Trump can end his quarantine tomorrow:

White House physician Sean Conley said it is safe for President Trump to return to public events, less than two weeks after being diagnosed with COVID-19. https://bit.ly/2SHBNAc

From Dr. Conley: “Saturday will be day 10 since Thursday’s diagnosis, and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the President’s safe return to public engagements at that time.”

Conley on Trump’s health: “Since returning home, his physical exam has remained stable and devoid of any indications to suggest progression of illness. Overall he’s responded extremely well to treatment, without evidence on examination of adverse therapeutic effects.”

The concern from health experts: “Health experts questioned his assessment, noting that patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms can be infectious for longer than 10 days.”

Yeah, but it goes further than that: “In addition to the safety concerns, there is also a political standoff between the two campaigns, with a fight over the dates and settings of the two remaining debates.”

The gist of what happened: The Commission on Presidential Debates made Oct. 15’s debate virtual. The Trump campaign then pulled out and called for the debates to be pushed a week — Oct. 22 and Oct. 29. The Biden campaign then rejected that idea, saying it was Trump’s decision whether to debate on Oct. 15.

"One-month UK lockdown could be extended, official says","British prime minister Boris Johnson announced the U.K. would be entering a second month-long national lockdown on Saturday, but senior cabinet minister Michael Gove said on Sunday that the lockdown could go on for longer.

""We can definitively say that unless we take action now, the (health service) is going to be overwhelmed in ways that none of us could countenance,"" Gove said on Sunday, according to Reuters.

In the interview, Sky News host Sophy Ridge questioned if the lockdown would be lifted on Dec. 2 as is currently planned or if the government would look at data before making any further decisions and possibly extend the lockdown.

Gove said the government would be looking at what data suggests regarding the rate at which the virus was spreading and act accordingly.

When Ridge asked if his response meant a possible extension of the lockdown he said, “Yes.”

The United Kingdom has the highest death toll in Europe with over 20,000 cases a day, according to Reuters. Under the current lockdown, all non-essential businesses will be closed including leisure and entertainment venues. People may leave their home for work, education, necessities and exercise either alone or with one other person from their household. The shutdown is expected to go into effect on Thursday Nov. 5.

Two weeks ago, Ridge also pressed Gove after he stated that there would be no national lockdown. Gove on Sunday defended the apparent reversal by the government.

“Well one of the things about the virus is that over the course of the last two weeks we've seen not just in the United Kingdom but also in France, Germany, Italy and other comparable countries the spread of the virus being greater than any of us had anticipated two weeks ago,” Gove said.

France and Germany announced new lockdowns last week and Italy has introduced several new, targeted mandates in light of rising COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Gove stated that the advice given at the time suggested that a targeted, regional approach to tackling the virus could be effective, pointing out France had pursued a similar course of action before announcing their lockdown.

Gove emphasized that the U.K. government hopes to get back to a point where lockdowns can be lifted nationally and regional approaches can be brought back to effectively combat the virus.

On Oct. 22, the U.K. broke its record for most cases in a single day, recording over 26, 000 cases, although the death rate has not reached the levels that were seen in the spring and summer.",2020-11-01 13:26:04-05:00,
UN warns of deadlier pandemics,"On Thursday, the United Nations panel on biodiversity warned that more deadly, economy-devastating diseases than COVID-19 can be expected in the future unless humans change how they treat nature.

In a special report, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) said that habitat destruction and overconsumption would increase the chances of animal borne diseases infecting people in the future, France24 reports.

IPBES says there are currently 850,000 viruses found in animals that could eventually infect humans, calling the issue an “existential threat” to humanity.

""The same human activities that drive climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk though their impacts on our agriculture,” said Peter Daszak, president of the Ecohealth Alliance and chair of the workshop that developed the special report.

COVID-19 is the sixth pandemic since the 1918 influenza outbreak that can be directly attributed to human activity, according to the panel. Five new diseases, each with the potential to become a pandemic, arrive every year.

IPBES cited unsustainable exploitation such as deforestation, agricultural expansion and wildlife trade and consumption as factors that bring humans in closer contact with animals and the multitude of diseases they carry.

COVID-19 has cost the global economy an estimated $16 trillion since July, the panel notes, and investing in the prevention of these pandemics would be hundreds of times cheaper than attempting to weather through them.

Coordinated global responses to pandemics, preventing loss of biodiversity and taxing products that bring humans in closer contact with animals were all suggestions from IPBES that could potentially lower the risk of another pandemic.",2020-10-29 11:52:32-04:00,
Taiwan goes 200 days without domestic COVID-19 case,"Taiwan, an island of more than 23 million people, has gone 200 days without a locally transmitted COVID-19 infection.

Taiwan achieved this impressive record through early border shutdowns, intensive contact tracing, enforced quarantines and loyal mask use by its residents, according to a Bloomberg report.

Other countries, including the United States, are now seeing a surge in new COVID-19 cases as winter approaches. France and Germany both announced national lockdowns on Wednesday.

Taiwan so far has had 553 confirmed cases and seven deaths from COVID-19.

A number of countries in Asia have generally done better in containing COVID-19, something that may be attributable to their previous experiences in handling infectious diseases.

Bloomberg noted that the SARS epidemic of 2003, which heavily impacted the island, gave Taiwan the experience needed to effectively combat the coronavirus.

Peter Collignon, professor of microbiology at the Australian National University, said to Bloomberg, “Taiwan is the only major country that has so far been able to keep community transmission of Covid eliminated.”

He notes that this accomplishment is even more impressive when pointing out that Taiwan has a comparable population size to Australia’s and residents tend to live in apartments much closer to each other. Australia has had more than 27,000 cases and 907 confirmed deaths.

Despite its successes, cases are still coming in from overseas, the article notes. More than 20 imported cases have been reported in the past two weeks, with three cases from the Philippines, U.S. and Indonesia reported on Thursday.",2020-10-29 11:10:04-04:00,

On Monday, France announced a record number of cases with more than 52,000 infections recorded in a single day. More than 500 deaths due to COVID-19 were reported Wednesday, the most since the first surge of cases in France in the spring.

“The virus is circulating at a speed that not even the most pessimistic forecasts had anticipated. Like all our neighbours, we are submerged by the sudden acceleration of the virus,"" the president said at a news conference, according to the report.

Under the second national lockdown, nonessential businesses such as restaurants and bars will close and people will only be allowed to leave their homes for essential work or medical reasons, according to Macron.

However, unlike the first lockdown, schools will remain open, and if employers decide it is impossible for workers to work from home, they will be allowed to travel to their places of work.

On Wednesday neighboring Germany announced a partial, monthlong shutdown that will close down bars, restaurants and gyms. Italy and Spain have announced new curfews in the past week, with the Italian government shutting down athletic facilities and cinemas on Sunday.

In early October, curfews affecting a third of France’s population were announced in an effort to stem the rising number of cases, but Macron acknowledged this week that the curfew had proved to be insufficient in its goal.

A second wave of coronavirus cases has been steadily building across Europe and the U.S. Experts predicted early on that cases would rise as temperatures dropped due to more time spent indoors to get away from the cold.",2020-10-28 16:14:08-04:00,
Russia's foreign minister in self-isolation,"Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has gone into isolation after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus.

This news comes one day after Lavrov met with Greek officials in Athens, The Associated Press reports. While in Greece, Lavrov spoke with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias and Alexis Tsipras, leader of the left-wing opposition party Coalition of the Radical Left.

In the announcement, Lavrov was said to be feeling well and no symptoms were reported. The person he came in contact with who tested positive was not identified.

The Russian diplomat is not the only government official to be affected by COVID-19. Ninety-one of Russia's 450-person lower house of the legislative assembly have contracted the virus. Many of them have been hospitalized as a result.

On Tuesday, the Russian government announced a nationwide mask mandate in response to surging cases and a record 320 deaths in one day. Masks must be worn in public places and at gatherings of more than 50 people.

On Oct. 14, Russia reported over 14,000 new cases in a single day, setting a new record for the country. It currently has the fourth highest amount of cases with over 1.5 million confirmed so far.

Countries all across Europe have announced stricter mandates to stem the spread of COVID-19. Curfews were set up in Italy, France and Spain with shutdowns announced for businesses such as athletic facilities and cinemas. Protests have broken out in Italy, some led by far-right groups, to protest the closures.

Russia announced in September that it had produced a vaccine for the coronavirus, making it the first to register a vaccine worldwide. The Russian government announced plans to test it on 40,000 people.

Medical journal The Lancet reported that all participants in the initial trial had developed antibodies without serious symptoms, saying the vaccine “has a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants.” Further testing was recommended, however.",2020-10-27 14:23:13-04:00,

"Nearly 10,000 eviction notices issued across five states in past month: report","Almost 10,000 eviction actions have reportedly been filed in five states across the country despite a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) moratorium issued in September.

Corporate landlords in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas have filed thousands of eviction notices, according to NBC News, citing information gathered by the nonprofit Private Equity Stakeholder Project, which looks at how private equity affects communities.

The CDC moratorium disallowed landlords from evicting tenants for not paying rent if they have been harmed by the coronavirus pandemic. As NBC News notes, the CDC considered this move critical to stopping the spread of coronavirus, estimating that nearly 40 million people would lose their homes if it were not for the eviction ban.

In order to be eligible for eviction protection, an individual must prove to their landlord five criteria: they have made attempts to gain government assistance, make less than $99,000 a year, are unable to make rent due to a ""substantial loss of income,"" are making efforts to pay as much as they can on time and that eviction would leave them homeless or in a close-quarter shared living space.

The ban does not stop landlords from evicting tenants due to reasons such as property damage and criminal activity.

In its report, NBC News looked at the case of Cristina Velez, who said she was nearly evicted by her landlord, Progress Residential. She told the network that she was not aware of the eviction ban, and her landlord never informed her of it.

""I told them I was affected by COVID, but it didn't matter to them. They are not very patient,"" Velez said. She added that she ultimately was forced to sell her car in order to pay the $4,210.14 in rent and legal fees after Progress Residential filed evictions proceedings against her.

Progress Residential owns more than 40,000 single-family homes across the country, NBC News noted.

""Progress Residential complies with applicable law, including the CDC Moratorium, in enforcing rental evictions,” the company said in a statement to the network. “Importantly, as part of the CDC Moratorium, tenants are required to provide a declaration that makes clear they are unable to pay rent due to the impact of Covid-19.""

Jim Baker, executive director of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said the numbers from just these five states likely indicate a larger issue to come.

“The decisions of large companies to advance evictions despite the moratorium quite literally threatens the health of residents and the broader public,” he told NBC News.

The CDC moratorium does not cancel payments. Residents must still pay the amount owed, and a CDC notice clarifying the rules of the moratorium is reportedly believed to be responsible for a recent rise in evictions.

The CDC specified that landlords are not banned from beginning eviction proceedings, even if they cannot remove residents, and landlords are not required to inform their residents of the evictions ban. Landlords are also allowed to challenge any claims of inability to pay rent due to the pandemic, and there is no appeal process for tenants if claims are rejected.

The moratorium is expected to end on Dec. 31.",2020-10-26 12:11:24-04:00,
Spain imposing curfew amid surge in coronavirus cases,"An overnight curfew will be imposed in Spain in light of rising coronavirus cases beginning on Sunday.

Regional Spanish leaders will be able to choose when curfews begin and end, however, with the flexibility to begin it between 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. and end it from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.

Authorities are hoping to avoid another complete shutdown like the one ordered in March. Health officials have also begun targeting night clubs and parties believed to be the primary source of new infections.

“There is no home confinement in this state of emergency, but the more we stay at home, the safer we will be. Everyone knows what they have to do,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.

The Canary Islands will not be affected by the new curfew, however, as data indicates the small group of islands is making positive progress in their number coronavirus cases. They were recently taken off Britain and Germany's list of unsafe travel destinations.

The Spanish curfew reflects similar actions taken by other European countries as they try to stymie an impending second wave of COVID-19 cases. A few weeks ago, France instated curfews on nine major cities, affecting up to a third of the French population. Italy announced new measures last week that allow Italian mayors to enforce 9 p.m. curfews on public squares and penalties for facilities that fail to follow guidelines.",2020-10-25 13:37:23-04:00,
"Fauci: We'll know whether a vaccine is safe, effective by early December","Dr. Anthony Fauci Anthony FauciSenior adviser points to vaccine when pressed on Trump's comments about 'rounding the corner' on pandemic Davis: 5 questions for Trump voters Fauci rips White House coronavirus approach MORE, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, predicted in a new interview that the safety and efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine would be known by early December.

During the second and final presidential debate, Trump said last Thursday that a vaccine would be ready “in the next few weeks.”

“I believe he said that correctly, we will know whether a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of November, the beginning of December,"" Fauci told BBC host Andrew Marr. ""The question is, once you have a safe and effective vaccine, or more than one, how can you get it to the people who need it as quickly as possible?”

Fauci clarified that even if one or multiple vaccines are found to be safe and effective by that time, they will “not certainly be enough to vaccinate everybody.""

""You'll have to wait several months into 2021,” adding later that a vaccine would likely be widely available in the second or third quarter of next year.

He also stated that health care workers and individuals with an increased risk of complications would likely be the first to receive the vaccine. Those priority immunizations would likely begin in the first three months of 2021, he said.

Fauci also said politicians must set an example by publicly following guidelines when asked about an anti-science bias in the U.S.

“People look at what their leaders say and do and you can positively or negatively influence behavior,’ he said. “One of the things I'm concerned about in the United States is that part of the anti-science translates maybe into anti-vaccine.”

He said this sentiment could especially affect the more vulnerable groups in the U.S. such as minority populations.

“It would really be a shame if we have a safe and effective vaccine, but a substantial proportion of the people do not want to take the vaccine because they don't trust authority. That would really be unfortunate if that's the case.”",2020-10-25 12:33:33-04:00,

The advisory requires people traveling to New York from certain states to quarantine for 14 days. States are placed on the list if they have a positive test rate that exceeds 10 per 100,000 residents or a positivity rate of 10 percent or higher over a 7-day period.

Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania also meet the travel advisory criteria, but Cuomo acknowledged placing them on the list would not be effective but Cuomo discouraged any non-essential travel to those three states.

“We are now in a situation where 43 states meet the criteria for our travel advisory,"" Cuomo said in a statement. ""This is really a bizarre outcome, considering New York once had the highest infection rate.""

""There is no practical way to quarantine New York from Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut. There are just too many interchanges, interconnections, and people who live in one place and work in the other,"" Cuomo said.

He also noted that barring travel between these states would have a detrimental effect on the economy.

""[R]emember while we're fighting this public health pandemic we're also fighting to open up the economy. However, to the extent travel between the states is not essential, it should be avoided,"" Cuomo said.",2020-10-20 16:45:33-04:00,

The post from Scott Atlas read, ""Masks work? NO"" followed by several posts questioning the effectiveness of masks in combating the spread of the coronavirus.

Twitter told The Hill in a statement that Atlas' tweet ""was in violation of our COVID-19 Misleading Information Policy"" that “prohibits sharing false or misleading content related to COVID-19 which could lead to harm.”

Twitter has flagged or removed several tweet relating to the pandemic and voting, including posts by President Trump, as it gets closer to Election Day.

US officials warned Nevada not to use donated Chinese COVID-19 test: report,"Documents obtained by The Associated Press show that U.S. officials warned the state of Nevada against using Chinese-made COVID-19 tests that were donated by the United Arab Emirates.

The warnings were made due to concerns regarding the accuracy of the tests, patient privacy and involvement by the Chinese government.

The office of Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak Steve SisolakJudge throws out Trump campaign lawsuit against New Jersey mail-in ballots US officials warned Nevada not to use donated Chinese COVID-19 test: report Trump confirms another White House staffer tested positive for COVID-19 MORE (D) instructed a Nevada hospital not to use 250,000 donated test kits after officials rejected a laboratory deal, according to emails obtained by the AP, a decision made after the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department notified the governor's office of the concerns.

Nevada has recently garnered some attention after a 25-year-old Nevada man was confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus twice, experiencing more severe symptoms the second time.

Unease about the test kits appear by officials to be centered around the Shenzhen-based company the BGI Group. BGI and Emirati company Group 42 (G42) partnered together to create a rapid-testing system in the UAE. According to an email sent to the AP in response to inquiries, BGI claims that G42 made the donations without informing the Chinese company.

Jim Murren, who heads Nevada’s COVID-19 response, told the AP that the CEO of G42, Peng Xiao, reached out to him offering to set up a “turnkey” laboratory capable of analyzing 10,000 to 50,000 coronavirus tests a day. BGI has set up multiple such labs in several different countries and Chinese cities.

In an email to Sisolak’s office, Murren wrote the offer of establishing a lab was seen by G42 as “a public service” and a “future investment opportunity for them.” Soon after the offer was made known, U.S. government officials shared their worries that such a lab could be a means for spying by the Chinese government.

The Washington Post reported in July that California had rejected a similar offer from BGI and G42, despite the surging number of cases the state was experiencing at the time.

Despite rising suspicions, BGI testing kits are approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use and in some labs but it has no access to patient samples or data.",2020-10-15 14:19:18-04:00,
Watchdog calls for probe into Gohmert 'disregarding public health guidance' on COVID-19,"A left-leaning anti-corruption watchdog called Tuesday for a probe into whether Rep. Louie Gohmert Louis (Louie) Buller GohmertGeorgia Republican Drew Ferguson tests positive for COVID-19 Michigan Republican isolating after positive coronavirus test GOP Rep. Mike Bost tests positive for COVID-19 MORE (R-Texas), who recently tested positive for COVID-19, was in violation of House rules for not complying with public health guidelines during the pandemic.

In a letter sent to Omar Ashmawy, the chief counsel and staff director at the Office of Congressional Ethics, Accountable.US President Kyle Herrig argued that Gohmert’s actions, including his decision not to wear a mask in the Capitol, “put his staff, colleagues, and other House staff at risk.”

Herrig noted reports that Gohmert, who tested positive late last month and has been quarantining in Texas, required a full staff in-office meeting, informed his staff of his diagnosis in person and potentially infected his colleague, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), during a committee hearing.

Attorney General William Barr Bill BarrWhy it's time for a majority female Cabinet Trump administration pressured federal prosecutors to settle investigation into Turkish bank: report DOJ shifts, will allow local police to wear body cameras during operations with federal agents MORE was also tested for the coronavirus after his exposure to Gohmert.

“After he recently contracted COVID-19, news reports revealed that Rep. Gohmert’s consistent failure to wear a mask resulted in staff across Capitol Hill feeling that they were putting their health in danger by showing up to work. At least one member of Gohmert’s staff appears to have learned of their boss’s COVID-19 status through media reports,” the letter said.

“It is alarming to learn that members of Rep. Gohmert’s staff who expressed concerns about safety protocols were ignored or laughed off,” it added.

House Democrats began requiring face masks at committee hearings in June.

Gohmert attended two hearings the day before his diagnosis and was spotted not wearing a mask outside a House Judiciary Committee hearing, sparking backlash from his Democratic colleagues and some GOP members.

“It is worth noting that Rep. Raul Grijalva recently tested positive for COVID-19 just days after he and Rep. Gohmert participated in a House Natural Resources Committee hearing together,” Herrig wrote.

“Public health experts have made it abundantly clear that wearing a mask is essential to curbing the spread of COVID-19. At a time when health care and other essential workers lack the personal protective equipment (PPE) to help keep them safe on the job, Rep. Gohmert has repeatedly opted not to wear a mask out of personal preference — putting his own health, and the health of all those who work for and around him, in danger,” he wrote.

Herrig said he believes that Gohmert’s “personal conduct and treatment of staff” during the pandemic undermines the “credibility of the House” and meets the standard for an investigation.

“Members of the House of Representatives are required to conduct themselves ‘at all times in a manner that reflects credibility on the House.’ (Rule 23, Clause 1),” the Accountable.US head wrote. “By disregarding public health guidance and purportedly creating a workplace climate that put the health of others in jeopardy, Rep. Gohmert clearly engaged in conduct that does not reflect credibility on the House.”

Gohmert's office did not immediately respond to request for comment.

After he tested positive, the Texas Republican questioned whether germs on his mask may have in fact caused him to contract the virus.

Health experts have repeatedly called for the public to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Leaders in both parties have advocated for members of their respective parties to wear masks, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthySunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day House Democrats run late ads defending vulnerable DCCC chair The truth, the whole truth about protecting preexisting conditions MORE (R-Calif.) calling for rapid testing to be brought to the Capitol for lawmakers, staff and press.

THE HILL’S CORONAVIRUS REPORT





Welcome to The Hill’s Coronavirus Report. It’s Friday, July 31.

Editor’s Note.

Thursday’s economic news gut punch of a 33 percent contraction is something that can’t be reversed overnight. The repercussions of those numbers — in terms of lost jobs, shuttered businesses, suspended investment and maintenance, collapsed local and state revenue — will be with this nation for a long time. Governments have to hold things together during economically paralyzed times, and the first couple rounds of stimulus packages have done a reasonably good job at that. But TODAY, folks’ federal unemployment benefits stop. The Senate has adjourned for the weekend. According to what Sen. Jeanne Shaheen Cynthia (Jeanne) Jeanne ShaheenTrump makes rare campaign stops in New England in closing stretch GOP coronavirus bill blocked as deal remains elusive Justice indicts two members of ISIS 'Beatles' cell MORE (D-N.H.) shared with me at The Hill’s conference on small business on Thursday, the White House and the Senate GOP caucus are having a hard time understanding one another. Her interview and another with Rep. Steve Chabot Steven (Steve) Joseph ChabotDemocrats seek wave to bolster House majority House Judiciary Republicans mockingly tweet 'Happy Birthday' to Hillary Clinton after Barrett confirmation Democrats, GOP fighting over largest House battlefield in a decade MORE (R-Ohio) are very well worth your time.

But let’s look beyond Washington to what is happening in some corners of the country where people are trying to stay afloat through their own wit and grit. In today’s Coronavirus Report anchor interview, GoDaddy CEO Aman Bhutani shares insights into what is happening with microbusinesses, which he calls ventures, all across the nation. GoDaddy is the largest registrar of internet domain names in the world, and the firm provides a large array of tools and platforms for large and small businesses operating in the e-commerce space. We know that the online commerce sector is booming right now, but not just for Amazon. People who have an idea or obsession and want to give their idea a commercial go, or those creating businesses as “side hustles,” to quote Bhutani, or who are trying to replace their lost job with something else are creating microbusiness ventures, usually online, and with that softening the economic repercussions of these times on their families and communities.

GoDaddy, in partnership with Arizona State University, UCLA Anderson School of Management, and the University of Iowa, have made public a fascinating array of data for a project called Venture Forward. This site, which is free and open to the public to investigate and perhaps learn from, shows which communities have high densities or lower densities of “ventures.” Interestingly, new ventures are being created all around the nation — every corner — in both red and blue states, in rural and urban areas, and by people of every ethnic background and across the socioeconomic spectrum. That’s the good news. The less good news is that very few local, state or federal policymakers understand what this means, nor understand what they can do to help enhance the environment for microbusiness growth.

As Bhutani writes in an op-ed for The Hill, civic leaders in Denison, Texas, get it, as they have pooled their efforts to start an e-incubator supporting new ventures in their communities. In my conversation with Chabot Thursday, he said we need to do more for those microfirms that have fewer than 10 employees, and those firms that just didn’t get up to the table for Paycheck Protection Program support in recent government COVID-19 stimulus packages. So, there’s a start. But the key insight that Bhutani shared and which policymakers need to know is that those communities in America that had the highest density of ventures and microbusinesses were the first in recovering from the 2008-2009 Great Recession. He thinks the same thing will happen today. There is something about the nimbleness of microbusinesses and their resilience in times of hardship that helps people make it to the other side in times of financial crisis. I hope you look at GoDaddy and Bhutani’s material and the human entrepreneurship stories that they highlight and that are out there today if we look for them.

On a separate note, the Coronavirus Report is going on extended hiatus after today. It’s been a daily obsession of ours for four months, and while this pandemic is not going to be done with us for a long time, we are directing our best coronavirus reporting and my occasional interviews over to The Hill’s Overnight Health Report. The good news is that our 3-D journalism online business is coming back strong, and I need to carve out more time for that.

CORONAVIRUS NUMBERS AT A GLANCE





On the last day writing The Hill’s Coronavirus Report, we are going to suspend most of the counting of who is up and who is down. The exception to that is just to share that today there are “officially” 17,334,539 cases of COVID-19 that have been reported worldwide. That is 239,000 more cases globally than yesterday, and the majority of those new official infections came from the United States.

For those of you following the daily trends and reports, not only globally, but also across the United States, we find that the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center is as good as any of the top information sources and commend their hard work and useful analysis. Our colleague Reid Wilson is regularly informing our colleagues of his deep insights into trends, and those will be reflected in The Hill’s ongoing COVID-19 reporting.

House Democrats find administration overspent for ventilators by as much as $500 million. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump has repeatedly touted his administration's supply of ventilators, a critical tool for treating patients with life-threatening respiratory symptoms. But internal emails and documents obtained by Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee suggest that the Trump administration failed to enforce an existing contract with a major medical manufacturer, delayed negotiations for more than a month and subsequently overpaid by as much as $500 million for tens of thousands of the devices — a costly error at a time when officials from some of the biggest states were warning of shortages.

Using an internet survey distributed in the last week of March that sampled 10,368 adults from across the country, researchers have sought to better understand the sociological and psychological effects of the pandemic.

Bill Gates says other nations had better coronavirus responses than U.S. While the United States has historically led the way when it comes to dealing with diseases such as smallpox, polio and HIV, other countries were faster with a coronavirus response, Microsoft founder Bill Gates said Thursday. A number of countries — which he did not name — got going a lot more quickly than the United States, said Gates, whose Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funds multiple health care initiatives. Countries with previous experience fighting SARS or MERS were the quickest and set up strong models, Gates said in a Time 100 talk. (CNN)

Coronavirus Report: The Hill's Steve Clemons interviews Aman Bhutani,"Steve Clemons: To talk to us today about the dynamism and to a certain degree, the resilience, of these microventures, some of which have scaled into very large firms, is GoDaddy CEO Aman Bhutani. Bhutani recently wrote a great op-ed in The Hill titled “The hustle of digital microbusinesses is helping communities survive the pandemic,” where he shares some of the insights from GoDaddy's Venture Forward project. It's open to all of you, for your own perusal, for free. Great to see you again, Aman. As you know, I'm obsessed with data and what's going on out there. And the story of these ventures is running somewhat counter to what we've been seeing with classic small businesses. Tell us about it.

Aman Bhutani: Steve, it's great to be back. And absolutely, the story is different for microbusinesses, and there are a few things, just top-line, that I think everyone needs to think about. One, we've seen three shocks in the last 20 years as a society as an economy, the .com bust, the great recession and now COVID. And the data is clearly showing that the communities that have more ventures — so these are the small microbusinesses, these communities handle those shocks better. What does that mean? It means lower job loss. It's also true in communities with low incomes. So, where it's really, really important, these ventures are making the difference. The second is that communities that have higher density of microbusinesses, which means more microbusinesses per hundred people, tend to do better in terms of prosperity. What does prosperity mean? We have a score for it that includes education, income, all the sort of core metrics that you would want to see, and together we call that prosperity. And these businesses really do better year over year. And the average median income that these businesses create in their communities is a whopping 11 percent higher. As an example, from 2016 to 2018 the average household median income grew about $3,600. But, if you were in a community that had only one highly active venture in it more than the other, so that density was one higher, the difference was another $400. That's real. That tells you that these microbusinesses are the backbone that help support us through the tough times. These businesses are more resilient, which means — you've got the shock, you've got the prosperity — which means they come back out of shocks much better. So, these businesses came out of the great recession much better, or these communities, I should say, came out of the great recession much better. And we're expecting to actually see similar things with COVID.

Clemons: Well, that was one of things I was gonna raise because I went in to kick around your data and look at it. I was interested in the '08-'09 financial crisis and what happened. And it's true that if you kind of map where the communities are that grew out of that more quickly, they were also the places with the densest microventures. So, I'm fascinated by that, and without kind of being overly laudatory, I am fascinated by the fact that I sort of feel like these are new signals that we in the Washington scene haven't really experienced before and seen it. So, I guess here's my zinger question: Is anybody in Washington aware of or know about this or has this just all organically happened? Does D.C. help or hurt, or are we just basically ignorant of what's happening that you have seen?

Bhutani: Broadly, Steve, nobody knows about this data. In fact, one of the legislators, he put it really well for us. He said, you know, we can't put policy in for something we don't see. So frankly, nobody sees this data. And we started working on it a couple of years ago, and now, organically, we've had a few leaders and government leaders and communities step forward, use the data, and there's some fantastic stories already. You know, in the op-ed that you mentioned, I wrote about William Myers from Denison, Texas. He took that data, took it to the local leadership in government and said, “You know what? We, we're going to put a number of offers out there to support businesses. We should have an e-commerce accelerator.” Why have an e-commerce accelerator? Because, look at this data. This data shows that we want to encourage our businesses to go online, and they ended up creating a whole new program, something they would have never done before. You know, we're working with the mayor of Gilbert, Mayor Jenn Daniels, and she's looking at a whole set of programs, and one of the ones that they're very focused on — and it came from the Venture Forward data — is that they want to have a clear program to support e-commerce businesses. And they ended up doing a public-private partnership to support microbusinesses specifically in the marketing arena, because for these microbusinesses the hardest thing is reaching new customers, right? When you take those two examples, that is government at the local level making a difference. But what we need is a set of policies at the center in D.C. that help all layers of government at the city level, at the county levels understand this data and be able to act on it and be encouraged to act on it.

Clemons: You know, one of the other parts of your story that excites me, we recently at The Hill had a very large national online summit on human connectivity on the coming of 5G, of you know, just a very new platform. When 4G came, firms like Lyft and Uber were created. But it occurred to me that when we move into this new world of data, hyper-connectivity, that the very small players, these microventures will possibly be able to achieve a nimbleness and a scale in what they're doing and a reach that may not have happened before. Have you thought a little bit about that element of what is coming ahead as a new platform for the microventures that you're dealing with?

Bhutani: Yeah. Us looking back in terms of what broadband did for these ventures helps us think about 5G in the future. So, broadband has — it's fantastic, it's actually something that we can all benefit from, and more work in D.C. to get broadband everywhere will be super helpful for everyone. But what the data shows us is that if you look at the top 10 percent of communities that did well, you know, through these shocks, through the great recession, you look at the bottom 10 percent, broadband access was about the same. What made the difference was what the venture density was. So, when I think about 5G, I think absolutely, yes, we want support from 5G. 5G can fill gaps where we may not have broadband access. So, it is absolutely needed. But what we're talking about is table stakes, Steve. What we need is the skills training on top of it. What we need is the support programs. What we need is the access to capital. What we need is to lower the threshold and start thinking about microbusinesses as what they are, like the true backbone that is making communities resilient. If I come to D.C. and we talk about small businesses, many people are going to talk about businesses that are 500 employees that have millions in revenue. Steve, I'm talking about companies that have one person. A whole third of GoDaddy's customers are ""solo-preneurs."" They’re alone. How do they even get access to PPP? They don't know where to go. This community needs special attention. And now that we know that they are making this big difference there is just no reason not to do the things we need to do to support them. So that's the thing, in my mind.

Clemons: Well, look, I'm a big believer in show and tell. I sort of feel I'm a show and tell storyteller, bringing people in. And you know, your story about Dennison, Texas — and you and I were on once talking with an incredible entrepreneur in Seattle. I put on my Facebook page, “Hey, who is a client of GoDaddy? And what has been your story during COVID?” And I literally got hundreds of stories back from people. So, I know that is very real, but when you look at all of those stories out there, is there any way to get a sort of clearing house? Because part of what you mentioned with Dennison, Texas, is, what are the replicable policy steps that people took that others might follow to do that? Have you thought about anything along those lines?

Bhutani: Yeah. You know, we're still early in terms of helping leaders define policy and truly understanding how to shape things for them. And what has been great is being able to work with Denison, Texas, or Gilbert or one or two other sort of local leadership. And we're sort of forming a structure on four core pillars, and those pillars tend to be, one, think about access and what access is about. It can be broadband, it can be 5G, it can be the set of things that people just need to be able to get online and the infrastructure to just make that happen. And to us, that is table stakes. That is not the thing that's going to make the true difference that we're seeing in the data. That's table stakes. But governments could do that in spades. They can help everyone have that equal level of access. The second is skills training, and this is an area where I think public-private partnerships could do a fantastic job. Companies like GoDaddy and many, many others should be putting more and more programs forward. We have a program called Empower, where we bring in entrepreneurs from underrepresented minorities and we give them access to not just the GoDaddy toolset, but the GoDaddy exec team. So, for example, last week I did a Q&A session with about 60 entrepreneurs, and they could ask me any question they wanted: how to run their business, what software to pick, how to decide how much to invest in tech, how to go after customers, how to manage an online store. And they had me and our CTO together. And we just took the questions one by one and slide on. We just answered them. That was so helpful for them, like the feedback from them is so personal. It's so real, right? Because it made a difference to them. So, skills training, having a public-private partnership around, can really make a difference. The third is access to capital — loans the PPP. Many of these businesses don't have access to bankers. Many of these businesses may not have the history to get loans. When we do these programs, of course they're super important for the economy. But we need to keep in mind that microbusinesses may not have the same level of access. And then it's just support. It’s support in terms of benefits programs. It’s support in terms of what are the other things that microbusinesses need, like the commerce accelerator-type thing that allow them to just get up and running. And, as Patty told you last time, from Fogue Studios, she told you that it took her two hours to turn her website into an e-commerce store. Two hours, right? Anyone should be able to do that, and we should tell people that they can do that. And they should go do it.

Clemons: I think just finally, Aman, I know you've talked about reaching underserved communities, communities of color, and I think that's really vital. In this time of COVID, what do you think policymakers need to hear about reaching to them? And one other kind of corollary of that is, 'cause you and I have talked about in the past, when you look at those people jumping into microventures who find ability, you know, a lot of them are immigrants. When you kind of look at folks that are new entrants that have recently come into America, they often have, you know, some of the most dynamic, risk-taking ideas, if you will. I'd love to hear a little bit about that as we close.

Bhutani: Yeah, Steve, I think the first step is — and this is the question we ask leaders when we meet them. We ask them, do you know the large businesses in your community? The answer is yes. Do you know the medium-size businesses in your community? The answer is yes. And the small businesses? Yes, many of them I know them. We meet them, you know, they have access to us. And then we ask about the microbusinesses and we say, “Hey, remember, in your community, there are probably thousands, if not tens of thousands of microbusinesses.” Many of these are side hustles. Many of these, like you said, are just the ideas people want to take online, and it's their creativity that they want to sort of put in front of the world. And these people are dynamic, they change businesses. You know, we have so many great stories in COVID where people used to run one type of business, COVID took that away, they completely pivoted, creating something else. These people are truly creative. But our leaders don't know these people. So, the first step is go to GoDaddy.com Venture Forward. Look at the microbusinesses in your community. If we don't get to know them, how are we going to help them, right? And everybody can do that. There's no requirement. You don't have to know something to do it, right? The second thing is, take a look at the data. What you will see in it is that microbusinesses improve the health of communities irrespective of rural, suburban, urban, education level, political leaning. If you control for all the factors, the venture density is what makes the difference. So, realize that, irrespective of what your stand might be, what your community might be, you can benefit, your community can benefit by knowing these people and understanding that data. And then the third step is to do the actions you know, get access for them, get the skills training, get them access to capital and give them support. I truly feel that we have to continue to talk about this. You said this; we have to create a new language. You talked about this the last time. We call it everyday entrepreneur. I love the idea of the hidden entrepreneur because these people are hidden, nobody knows about. Well, let's get to know them. Let's do those four things. If we do it at the local level, we're gonna win. If we can do it in Washington, Steve — and you can help us do that — I think the whole country wins.

Clemons: Well, look, I would just say to my viewers right now, you know, to the hidden entrepreneurs out there, that if you go to the GoDaddy.com/VentureForward site, — I'm a data obsessed guy, so, I love the numbers, but what you'll also see there is a map, and in the map, you can click on various parts of it and you can see real human stories of what's been done, and I just find them extremely inspiring, very, very different and varied. And I really want to tip my hat for you folks realizing there was something there because I'm sure at one point they were just a lot of domain names. And somebody said, “You know, there's something going on that's very, very different and important, and particularly during a time of economic and health crisis.”",2020-07-31 15:37:17-04:00,
White House defends Trump over Atlanta mayor's mask accusations,"The White House on Thursday defended President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE after Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms Keisha Lance BottomsBiden to air 90-minute radio programs targeting Black voters Sunday shows preview: Trump, Biden gear up for final sprint to Election Day Atlanta school board committee recommends renaming Henry W. Grady High School after Ida B. Wells MORE (D) accused him of breaking the law by failing to wear a mask during a visit to the city's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.

White House spokesman Judd Deere told The Hill that Trump was following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) when he attended an event without a mask at the Atlanta airport. Trump's visit to the city was capped by his announcement that his administration would roll back of one of the nation's bedrock environmental laws.

""The President takes the health and safety of everyone traveling in support of himself and all White House operations very seriously,"" Deere said in a statement to The Hill.

""When preparing for and carrying out any travel, White House Operations collaborates with the Physician to the President and the White House Military Office, to ensure plans incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting COVID-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible.""

Footage from Trump's visit to the Atlanta airport showed the president eschewing a face covering as officials around him wore them. Trump never left the airport during his visit.

Speaking on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" Bottoms said that Trump's move amounted to a violation of her executive order requiring people to wear masks amid the coronavirus outbreak.

""I signed an executive order that requires masks in the city of Atlanta and specifically on city-owned property, which Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is. So by not having on the mask, President Trump did violate the law in the city of Atlanta,"" she said.

""I am somehow not surprised that he disregarded our rules and regulations in this city,"" Bottoms, who announced earlier this month that she contracted COVID-19, added. ""But it was encouraging to see others did have some regard for what we’re doing and trying to accomplish in Atlanta, and that’s to slow the spread of COVID-19.""

A recent surge in coronavirus cases in the U.S. has coincided with an aggressive push from federal, state and local leaders for the public to wear masks in public. At least 22 states and Washington, D.C., have instituted measures mandating face coverings.

However, Trump has been reluctant to wear them in public. He wore a face covering in view of cameras for the first time last Saturday during a visit to Walter Reed hospital.

Bottoms signed an executive order on July 8 requiring city residents to wear masks in public. But the decision engendered a dispute between her and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who on Wednesday night issued an order prohibiting local municipalities across the state from mandating that masks be worn in public.

The move effectively voided orders issued by at least 15 local governments across the state, according to The Associated Press . Instead of a mandate, Kemp's executive order says residents and visitors of the state are “strongly encouraged to wear face coverings as practicable” when in public settings.

But that hasn’t stopped members from outlining a number of options.

Here's a look at the competing proposals.

Fix NICS Act

This bill is aimed at bolstering records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and was introduced after a shooting last year in Sutherland Springs, Texas.

It has gained new momentum, but also new opposition, since the shooting in Parkland, Fla.

The bill enforces existing laws by ensuring that authorities report criminal records to the system and penalizing agencies that don't.

Despite its bipartisan origins — it was introduced by Sens. John Cornyn John CornynBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Pollsters stir debate over Trump numbers MORE (R-Texas) and Chris Murphy Christopher (Chris) Scott MurphyBitter fight over Barrett fuels calls to nix filibuster, expand court Democrats warn GOP will regret Barrett confirmation Democrats brace for nail-biting finish to Senate battle MORE (D-Conn.) — Democrats have rejected the bill as too narrow.

Manchin-Toomey

The 2013 background check bill got a burst of new life after President Trump suggested it be used as the base for Congress’s new gun push.

The legislation spearheaded by Sens. Joe Manchin Joseph (Joe) ManchinBitter fight over Barrett fuels calls to nix filibuster, expand court Democratic Senate emerges as possible hurdle for progressives Susan Collins and the American legacy MORE (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey Patrick (Pat) Joseph ToomeyAppeals court rules NSA's bulk phone data collection illegal Dunford withdraws from consideration to chair coronavirus oversight panel GOP senators push for quick, partial reopening of economy MORE (R-Pa.) in the weeks after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting failed to overcome a filibuster, mostly by Republicans.

Five Democrats also opposed it, but only one, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp Mary (Heidi) Kathryn HeitkampWhy it's time for a majority female Cabinet The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by JobsOhio - Showdown: Trump-Biden debate likely to be nasty Senate Democrats want to avoid Kavanaugh 2.0 MORE (D-N.D.), remains in the Senate. She is up for reelection this fall.

The legislation would have expanded background checks for internet and gun show sales, while also including exemptions for friends and family.

Toomey told The Associated Press that he spoke on the phone with Trump, who was supportive of using Manchin-Toomey as the “core legislative vehicle.”

But the bill would likely face an uphill battle.

Twelve Democrats who supported the legislation are no longer in the Senate and half of them were replaced by Republicans.

Background checks:

Senate Democrats are demanding more extensive background checks on gun purchases.

Sen. Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerDemocrats on edge as Biden-Trump fight nears end Reestablishing American prosperity by investing in the 'Badger Belt' House Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education MORE (D-N.Y.), outlining his caucus’s three-part plan, said Trump should “at a minimum” support closing “loopholes” by requiring background checks for all firearms sold at gun shows or over the internet.

“I think the president knows he could show real leadership by bucking the [National Rifle Association], providing cover for his Republicans and getting something actually done,” he told reporters.

Schumer didn’t say if Democrats would offer Manchin-Toomey as their background check legislation or file a separate piece of legislation.

A Quinnipiac University poll released late last month found that 97 percent of Americans — including 97 percent of gun owners and 97 percent of Republicans — support requiring a background check on every gun sale.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Friday that the president is “not necessarily” pushing for “universal” background checks.

“Certainly improving the background check system. He wants to see what that legislation, the final piece of it looks like,” she told reporters.

School safety

Trump has homed in on school safety following the shooting, saying campuses should be “hardened.”

“These include allowing people with a certified training, very talented people, to carry firearms,” Trump said during this week’s White House meeting with lawmakers.

While getting Congress to pass funding for his idea appears unlikely, lawmakers are offering, or preparing to offer, their own school safety legislation.

Republican senators, led by Sen. Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchMellman: What happened after Ginsburg? Bottom line Bottom line MORE (Utah), are expected to introduce legislation that would increase funding for Justice Department school violence prevention grants.

Meanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioIntercept co-founder Jeremy Scahill says long-term damage is already done even if Trump loses Wisconsin GOP says hackers stole .3M Hillicon Valley: Big Tech hearing the most partisan yet | Rubio warns about foreign election interference | Trump campaign site briefly hacked MORE (R-Fla.), arguing federal law “appears to discourage school systems from reporting dangerous students to law enforcement,” said he would introduce legislation to try to cut down on the delay.

Assault weapons ban

House and Senate Democrats are pushing for a ban on assault weapons following the Florida shooting — a move supported by the party’s base but unlikely to pass Congress.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein Dianne Emiel FeinsteinPence seeks to lift GOP in battle for Senate McConnell and Schumer's relationship shredded after court brawl Murkowski predicts Barrett won't overturn Roe v. Wade MORE (D-Calif.) raised the issue during the White House meeting and was openly giddy when Trump appeared open to including it in a broad bill.

Most of the House Democratic Caucus is backing similar legislation.

Minimum age

Sens. Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeWhy it's time for a majority female Cabinet Why Maricopa County will choose the next president Trump fights for battleground Arizona MORE (R-Ariz.) and Feinstein introduced legislation less than an hour after the White House meeting that would raise the minimum age for buying an assault rifle from 18 to 21.

The suspect in the Florida shooting, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, is said to have used an AR-15, which gun control proponents say is a form of an assault weapon. Many gun rights supporters disagree with that view.

Trump encouraged lawmakers to strongly consider the issue, though Sanders acknowledged that Trump “knows there's not a lot of broad support for that.”

GOP Rep. Thomas Massie Thomas Harold MassieHouse in near-unanimous vote affirms peaceful transfer of power Ron Paul hospitalized in Texas GOP lawmaker praises Kyle Rittenhouse's 'restraint' for not emptying magazine during shooting MORE (Ky.) has introduced a bill that would lower the minimum age for buying a handgun from 21 to 18.

Bump stocks

Lawmakers are pushing forward with formal legislation to ban bump stocks even as Trump said he would “quickly” sign an executive order making the gun attachment illegal.

The device allows a semi-automatic weapon to function similarly to an automatic weapon, with multiple rounds fired with the single pull of a trigger.

A bump stock wasn’t used in the Florida shooting. But they came onto the nation’s radar after they were reportedly used during a shooting at a concert in Las Vegas where 56 people were killed.

“Red flags”

Both Rubio and Schumer have pointed to allowing law enforcement or close family members to use a court order to temporarily block an individual deemed dangerous from being able to buy or posses a gun as a priority.

Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamSenate candidates focus closing arguments on health care, experience Sunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day Ocasio-Cortez responds to Lindsey Graham debate swipe: You folded 'like a wet napkin' MORE (R-S.C.) also said they are working on “red flag” legislation. The two senators are expected to introduce their bill next week.

“Our government encourages our citizens that if you see something, say something. We also need ‘do something,’ ” Graham said in a statement.

Straw purchases

Cracking down on straw purchases, when an individual who can pass a background check buys a gun for someone who can’t, appears to have support from across the Senate’s political spectrum.

Rubio said he is working on legislation that would provide more resources for prosecutors to go after the individuals who buy the gun. And Sanders name-dropped the issue during his floor speech outlining how Congress should respond to the Florida shooting.

Election integrity expert: 'This is a 100-year flood of voters',"The U.S. is seeing ""a 100-year flood of voters,"" said Neil Persily, a Stanford University law professor and expert on election law.

Appearing on “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Persily said the voter turnout this year has been astounding.

“If you had asked me six months ago, whether we would have 90 million people who had already voted, and then expected 150 to 160 million voters who would have voted in the election, I would have been shocked,” said Persily. “This is a 100-year flood of voters that we were seeing, and while there's always reasons to be concerned and vigilant, we shouldn't look at Election Day and see isolated instances of problems and assume that that is the story.”

Persily noted there has not been much evidence to suggest widespread chaos around the voting process so far.

“Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd Charles (Chuck) David ToddElection integrity expert: 'This is a 100-year flood of voters' White, non-college voters will play a large part in deciding the election according to polling expert NBC moves Texas to 'toss-up' in presidential race MORE also asked Persily about the litigation surrounding this year's election, particularly around the issue of when mail-in ballots must be received in order to be counted, specifically bringing up Pennsylvania.

“I think that what we've seen in Pennsylvania is that they're trying to take a risk-averse approach -- that they're going to segregate these ballots just to make sure that if they are in doubt after the election, that it doesn't call the final result into question. And I think that, you know, this is because we've had some conflicting signals sent by the U.S. Supreme Court, we've had lots of litigation in Pennsylvania, but it's a pretty prudent move,” said Persily.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that ballots can be counted in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, as long as they are postmarked no later than Election Day, or lack a postmark altogether, and arrive by Nov. 6.

This year has seen the most litigated election in U.S. history, with Persily noting there have been hundreds of lawsuits challenging or defending mail-in ballots.

The Trump campaign has brought lawsuits challenging the ability to accept ballots received after Election Day in battleground states including Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin.

“This is sort of the legacy of Bush v. Gore 20 years ago is that the lawyers are becoming an important part of the campaign, as well,” Persily said.

When asked how this year’s election season should inform the future of national elections going forward, Persily said the current election system needed an “autopsy” to determine how to have the election “ run smoothly.”

He also praised the work of local election officials saying, “I have to tell you, over the last six months, we've had hundreds of thousands of these local, sort of unsung heroes who have been dedicating their time to trying to adapt the election infrastructure to deal with the pandemic and they have done an unbelievable job.""",2020-11-01 14:44:31-05:00,

“But the president is still going to do exceedingly well in what has historically been a Democrat area, the Ohio valley, eastern Ohio” as well as in “all the other rural counties.”

Buttigieg slammed the Trump campaign in an interview with CNN’s “State of the Union,” saying they have “given up” and resorted to voter suppression.

“Unfortunately it seems that Republicans have given up – at least Donald Trump’s campaign has really given up on the idea of persuading voters and is instead turning to the idea of suppressing voters,” he said.

The former mayor of South Bend, Ind., criticized the administration for trying “to disenfranchise” voters, specifically in Texas, and for attempting “maneuvers to try and make it harder to get absentee ballots” particularly for those serving overseas.

“This is especially shocking,” Buttigieg said. “I don’t know what Donald Trump has against soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who are returning absentee ballots from abroad.”

""It is going to be a stain on that campaign forever that they thought part of their strategy to win was to make it harder for American citizens, including patriots serving overseas, to have their voices heard,” he added.

Evers criticized the comments Trump made during a rally in Waterford Township, Mich., on Friday, telling CNN’s “State of the Union” that the allegation is not “the basic issue here.”

“We are in the middle of a pandemic,” he said. “We have hotspots all across the state. People are dying at high numbers, and then Trump is up in Green Bay at the same time talking about the fact that the doctors are … identifying people as COVID-19 deaths when they’re not just so they can make money.”

“Honest to God, it’s just breathtaking,” he continued. “We’re in a very difficult situation here. We should be pulling together.”

The Wisconsin governor countered Trump, who has repeatedly said the virus is “rounding the corner,” by saying “It ain’t over.”

“We have a president that believes the doctors are at fault or are messing with the numbers,” he said. “And he believes that it’s over. It ain’t over.”

Evers said he was not considering imposing another lockdown but noted if the public is concerned about their health they won’t “go spend money.”

“We need to do the basic things in Wisconsin and frankly some people aren’t doing them because they’re listening to Donald Trump,” he said.

“People aren’t gonna go spend money if they don’t have confidence in their health,” he added. “That is the basic issue here. It’s not whether doctors are making more money for not. That is such a stupid thing to say.”

The candidates have been busy on the campaign trail this week in the final push to win over several key battleground states. Trump in particular is hosting a flurry of rallies in the remaining three days to Nov. 3, focusing on Pennsylvania and the Midwest.

On Sunday, he’s holding five rallies in all the states he won in 2016 but where he is now on defense: Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida.

Biden is expected to campaign in Pennsylvania on Sunday, and he and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden begins two-day campaign sprint in battleground Pennsylvania Trump praises Texas supporters who surrounded Biden-Harris bus FBI investigating Biden bus surrounded by pro-Trump cars: report MORE (D-Calif.), will travel across the state together on Monday.

Both Biden and Trump have also focused heavily on Florida, holding dueling rallies there this week. If the president does not win the state of Florida, it will be very difficult for him to win reelection.

A Fox News poll released Friday shows that Biden has an 8-point lead over the president nationally, an increase that is not statistically significant from the 10-point advantage he had earlier this month.

The Sunday shows will be filled with surrogates and associates of both candidates, including Biden campaign adviser Anita Dunn, who will appear on ABC’s “This Week,” and Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiSunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day Giuliani associate Correia pleads guilty to making false statements Spies are trying to influence the election — US spies, that is MORE who will appear on “America This Week” with Eric Bolling.

The Supreme Court on Monday voted 5-3 to deny Democrats’ request to reinstate a 6-day extension for receiving mail-in ballots in Wisconsin. The Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a second request from the GOP to block a mail-in ballot due date extension. The decision means that the court would not hear the case until after Election Day.

Barrett took to the bench of the Supreme Court for the first day on Tuesday, but did not take part in considering the case.

Thursday, the high court denied a Republican bid to fast-track a similar case to block mail-in ballot extensions in North Carolina.

Both rejections are a significant blow for Republicans and Trump.

Biden leads Trump by 8 points nationally: poll,"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE has an 8-point lead over President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE nationally in a new Fox News poll released Friday.

Biden has the support of 52 percent of likely voters in the poll, while Trump trails at 44 percent. Two percent of likely voters say they’re backing a third-party candidate, and another 2 percent are undecided.

Biden’s 8-point lead is statistically insignificant from the 10-point advantage he enjoyed in the same poll earlier this month.

The former vice president has a net-positive favorability rating with likely voters, with 55 percent saying they have a favorable view of him and 43 percent saying they have a negative view. Meanwhile, Trump’s favorability rating is underwater, with just 44 percent of likely voters having a favorable view of him compared with 55 percent who have an unfavorable opinion.

“Biden is holding a substantial lead nationally, many votes are already cast, and there are few undecideds,” said Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducted the survey with Republican Daron Shaw. “It’s hard to see the national race shifting significantly in the closing days, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible for Trump to again thread the needle on an Electoral College victory.”

Biden runs up wide margins among historically Democratic-leaning demographics, including a 56-39 lead among women, an 80-14 edge among Black voters and a 57-39 advantage among voters under the age of 45. Trump holds only single-digit leads among men and white voters, both demographics that came out in force for him in 2016. Biden also has a 53-43 lead among seniors, a stark reversal from when older voters backed Trump four years ago.

A small subgroup of independents back Biden by a 54-32 margin. Trump won independents by 1 point in 2016.

“Biden has the advantage among key groups, especially seniors, suburbanites, and independents,” said Shaw. “Trump needs a few more points out of these groups to win re-election. But the main impediment is the stubborn stability of the race; it hasn’t changed much all year despite pandemics, economic collapses, and massive social unrest.”

The poll comes as surveys show Biden leading the president both nationally and in key swing states, with prognosticators favoring the former vice president to win the White House. The RealClearPolitics national polling average shows Biden up 7.9 percent.

The Fox News poll surveyed 1,246 likely voters from Oct. 27-29 and has a margin of error of 2.5 percent.",2020-10-30 20:13:53-04:00,

They stood on the White House balcony, which was decorated with American flags.

“This is a momentous day for America, for the United States Constitution, and for the fair and impartial rule of law,” Trump, who had just returned from campaigning in Pennsylvania, said in prepared remarks before Thomas administered the oath. “She is one of our nation’s most brilliant legal scholars and she will make an outstanding justice on the highest court in our land.”

Barrett spoke following the oath, thanking Trump and Senate leaders and emphasizing the need for judges to put aside their personal policy views.

“It is the job of a senator to pursue her policy preferences. In fact, it would be a dereliction of duty for her to put policy goals aside. By contrast, it is the job of a judge to resist her policy preferences. It would be a dereliction of duty for her to give into them,” Barrett said.

“The oath that I have solemnly taken tonight means at its core that I will do my job without any fear or favor, and that I will do so independently of both the political branches and of my own preferences,” she continued.

A few hundred individuals, including senators and White House officials, were present for the event. Attendees were required to wear masks and sat in folding chairs distanced from one another to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has this month infected several individuals in the White House, including the president and first lady.

The set up stood in contrast with the Rose Garden ceremony honoring Barrett in late September where individuals were close together and interacted without masks — a gathering later deemed a “super-spreader” event by health experts.

Trump and Republicans pushed forward, however, moving Barrett through confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee and scheduling a vote on her nomination Monday evening. Barrett deflected questions during her days-long hearing on how she might rule on abortion, health care and election-related cases.

Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court just eight days before Election Day. Republicans are hoping that her nomination will energize conservatives at a time when public polling shows the GOP control of the White House and Senate under threat. Democrats, meanwhile, hope that the fight over her nomination will help energize the liberal base.

States across the country are currently seeing a surge in early voter turnout compared with previous years, with data currently favoring Democrats.

Barrett will quickly begin work on high-profile cases. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on Nov. 10 in the Trump administration’s effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act.

Concerns rise over election-related unrest,"Fears of violence and unrest around the 2020 presidential election are on the rise as Americans brace for a host of potential electoral disputes that threaten to worsen political tensions.

The concerns are born out of an already vitriolic campaign season, in which President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE has repeatedly cast doubt on the accuracy of the eventual election results and called on supporters to “go into polls” to monitor the voting process for potential fraud, a move that Democrats fear could result in voter intimidation.

There is also mounting concern among some political observers that growing distrust in the fairness of the election may lead to a post-election backlash by the losing side, especially given Trump’s suggestion that the only way he will lose is if the election is “rigged.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“There’s a heightened level of distrust and there is a significant belief, particularly among Trump supporters, that he is going to win and he’s going to win because the polls are wrong,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.

“If Trump indicates after the election that there was something wrong if he lost, then I’d be worried about what his followers would do,” Murray added. “I don’t know what they would do. There’s so many pieces to that puzzle, but the foundation is already laid there that they would agree with him if that’s something he decides to do.”

A Monmouth poll released last month found that voters on both sides of the political aisle are suspicious of potential foul play by the opposing side. More than three-quarters of firm Trump supporters — 78 percent — said that it is very likely that the campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE, the Democratic nominee, would try to cheat in order to win, while 91 percent of firm Biden supporters said they believe Trump would do so.

“We haven’t seen this in the past — people saying before the election that they're disinclined to believe the results if they don’t turn out the way they want them to,” Murray said. “We certainly have seen quite a bit of unrest over the past year, so that would suggest that you should be prepared for more of it.”

But the concerns about election-related conflict are not limited to any one political group. A poll from YouGov released earlier this month showed that a majority of voters — nearly 56 percent — expect to see an increase in violence in the wake of the Nov. 3 election, including 53 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.

Local and state officials said that they have not yet seen any credible threats regarding post-election unrest. But they are already preparing for potential mayhem on Nov. 3 and in the days and weeks after the election, holding interagency exercises on how to respond to a range of scenarios.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Lori LightfootWalmart reverses decision to remove guns, ammo from sales floors ICE agents told to be ready for unrest in DC on Election Day California governor preparing state for civil unrest following election MORE (D) said that officials recently held an “all-hazards drill” to “really walk through in a logical way” how they might respond to possible election-related threats.

“Given what we experienced over the course of the spring and the summer, we can’t presume that what’s going to happen … is going to be peaceful,” Lightfoot said on a conference call on Tuesday. “We are preparing for the worst. So what we’ve been doing is a lot of drilling, a lot of making sure that we break down barriers, that no one part of election security is operating in a silo.”

Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said that law enforcement is “planning, practicing, creating protocols to deploy our resources before, on and even after Election Day.”

Harrison acknowledged that law enforcement officers will have to tread lightly with respect to their presence at or near polling sites, saying that they “should not be highly visible.” But he noted that his and other police departments are prepared to respond to reports of voter harassment or intimidation, as well as “to de-escalate tensions at the polls.”

2020 has proven to be a year rife with tension in the United States as the coronavirus pandemic, economic turmoil and civil unrest over racial injustice and police brutality divided Americans along political lines.

In what some officials and experts say is a preview of potential election-related conflict, skirmishes broke out between supporters of Trump and counterprotesters in New York City on Sunday, leading to several arrests and serving as a reminder of the heightened tensions around the presidential race.

Adding to the uncertainty around the election is the potential for delayed vote counts that could leave the race for president undecided for days or even longer.

More Americans than ever have opted to vote by mail this year, as states moved to expand early voting options amid the coronavirus pandemic. But a patchwork of state deadlines for officials to receive, process and count mail ballots means that the outcome of the election may not be known on election night, raising concerns that one candidate may try to claim victory prematurely.

Vanita Gupta, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said that given possible delays in the election results and the ultra-polarized political climate, it will be incumbent on public officials to update voters on the election process.

“We do know there’s a lot of anxiety,” Gupta, who led the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under former President Obama, told reporters on a conference call. “We can’t deny that we are in heightened, polarized times. There’s been a lot of talk of threats. So I do think it’s going to be really important to provide the public with information and calming reassurance.”",2020-10-27 19:59:03-04:00,

Trump has only worn a face covering on rare occasions and has periodically questioned the usefulness of face coverings, despite public health agencies saying it is one of the most effective ways to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Trump's outright dismissiveness toward pandemic safety measures comes as the United States sets records for daily coronavirus infections and as Wisconsin, Texas, Utah and others are faced with limited hospital capacity.

""We're still rounding the corner,"" Trump insisted at the Michigan rally on Friday.

FEMA to end funding for cloth face masks for schools,"Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials said Tuesday the agency will end federal funding for cloth face masks in schools around the country.

Recordings of a call between FEMA representatives and state officials obtained by NPR indicated that the new plan will face criticism from officials around the country who questioned on the call why the agency would only fund masks if they were deemed necessary to stop a ""direct emergency.""

""Supporting schools and other functions — courthouses and other related functions – are not a direct emergency protective measures and therefore they're not eligible for [federal funding],"" said Keith Turi, a FEMA official, according to NPR.

ADVERTISEMENT

""There are costs that being incurred and required based on COVID, but they are all not necessarily emergency protective measures, and they're not necessarily all FEMA-eligible,"" he added in a response to one state official who questioned the policy.

FEMA's stance appears to be that masks are necessary to the basic operation of schools in the fall and should not therefore fall under the category of emergency equipment. A request for further comment from The Hill was not immediately returned.

The announcement comes as school districts around the country are returning for fall semester, with many still facing tough decisions over whether in-person learning will return and in what form it will take amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than six million Americans since its beginning earlier this year.

FEMA officials reportedly noted on the call that masks will still be funded by the federal government in some other settings.

The agency said in late July that it was still struggling to adequately provide personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks to front line healthcare workers.",2020-09-01 20:16:03-04:00,

The tug-of-war over the state’s 29 electoral votes included rallies for each candidate in Tampa, Fla., with Biden also making an appearance in Broward County to tell supporters that Florida could put Democrats back in the White House next week.

“You hold the power. If Florida goes blue, it’s over,” Biden said.

The Associated Press: Trump, Biden fight for Florida, appeal for Tuesday turnout.

The Hill’s Campaign Report: What the latest polling says about the presidential race.

With Florida in the spotlight, four new polls of the key contest emerged on Thursday. All four showed Biden holding a lead over the president of 3 to 5 percentage points. According to a Hill-Harris poll, the former vice president holds a 3-point advantage over Trump (The Hill).

The appearances on Thursday also were an opportunity for the former vice president to solidify support among Latino Americans, with questions swirling whether they will come out in the same numbers that did so for Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE four years ago. According to a new Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday, Biden leads overall by 3 percentage points, but that his lead among the key bloc was down to only 16 points. Clinton carried the constituency in Florida by 27 points.

However, a Monmouth University survey found that the former VP is ahead by 5 points in the battleground state and that he matches Clinton’s margin among Latinos.

The Hill exclusive poll: Biden leads in Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina.

The Washington Post: In campaign’s waning days, both candidates seek to shore up support from Latino voters.

Looking ahead, the two presidential candidates will crisscross a number of key battleground states between today and Monday. Today, the president will hold rallies in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota — the last of which will only allow 250 attendees due to state capacity limits — with three appearances slated across Pennsylvania on Saturday as part of his last-ditch effort to hold on to some semblance of his Rust Belt wall that propelled him to the White House last cycle.

Trump is also expected to hold events in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina before Election Day, with his campaign attempting to hammer home an economic message in the coming days (The Associated Press). The renewed economic messaging comes on the heels of news that the economy grew at a record 33.1 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, recovering some of the deep losses driven by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic (The Hill).

As The Hill’s Morgan Chalfant and Sylvan Lane write, the Trump campaign is seizing on record-breaking growth, using the news to make a last-minute pitch to voters that the president is the best candidate to handle the recovery from the coronavirus recession. During his rally in Tampa, Fla., on Thursday, Trump was eager to share the news.

“Did you see the number today? 33.1 GDP. The biggest in the history of our country by almost triple,” Trump told supporters.

The Hill: Weekly jobless claims fall to 751,000 in last report before election.

The Hill: Trump campaign postpones North Carolina rally, citing weather.

Across the aisle, Biden will hold campaign events in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin today. Minnesota was added to his schedule in a rare sign of playing late-game defense (The Washington Post).

As The Hill’s Amie Parnes reports, Democrats are by-and-large feeling optimistic about the Democratic nominee’s chances of defeating Trump in four days. However, that has not stopped them from second guessing some decisions the Biden campaign has made about his travel schedule in the final week of the campaign.

Among the criticisms of Biden’s travel over the final week include the campaign’s decision to send the nominee to Georgia on Tuesday instead of focusing on either Michigan or Wisconsin, which are considered must-win states. Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden begins two-day campaign sprint in battleground Pennsylvania Trump praises Texas supporters who surrounded Biden-Harris bus FBI investigating Biden bus surrounded by pro-Trump cars: report MORE’s (D-Calif.) appearance in Texas later today has also drawn the ire of some Democrats.

“It's definitely a little off-putting,” said one Democratic strategist. “I think the Biden folks are putting themselves at a big risk for being second-guessed. It feels like even if it's only perception, perception is super important at this point in the race … [it’s as] important as much as stoking enthusiasm and confidence.”

Politico: Trump's chances hinge on a polling screw-up way worse than 2016.

The Atlantic: How Trump could shock the world again.

Poll watch: In North Carolina, Biden and Rep. Cal Cunningham (D) hold narrow leads in The New York Times-Siena College survey released on Thursday. Biden’s 48-45 lead over Trump among likely voters is within the poll’s margin of error (The Hill) …. Skeptics insist Trump’s support in surveys is underrepresented and that the election outcome will establish that the polling industry and election analysts missed the president’s 2020 support in key states. Nervous Democrats, haunted by Clinton’s experience four years ago, fear this could yet be true. A Trump reelection would nevertheless be a far greater shock than his narrow win by 77,000 votes in the Electoral College in 2016, reports The Hill’s Jonathan Easley. … Pollsters were closer in 2016 to the presidential outcome than many people assume, but improvements have been made in 2020 to capture late-breaking shifts in key states and to weight for educational attainment, a marker important to gauge support for the presidential candidates (The Washington Post).

More than 82 million Americans have already voted, according to the U.S. Elections Project, representing nearly 60 percent of the 2016 turnout.

LEADING THE DAY

MORE POLITICS: Money: Republicans have watched as Democrats amassed and spent a mountain of cash during the 2020 election cycle, which helped the party move deep-red states into the toss-up column.

IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES

CORONAVIRUS: In the United States and in Europe, new cases of COVID-19 are escalating with a speed that alarms public health experts and leads disease forecasters to offer projections that are downright chilling when weighed against the trajectory of the pandemic experienced in the spring and summer.

The United States set a new weekly record with more than 500,000 cases of COVID-19. In a geographically dispersed pattern, 25 states set records for confirmed cases in the last two weeks, including 17 states with record highs recorded over a matter of a few days. No state has been bending the curve as winter approaches (The Hill).

During a week in which more than 3,000 people have died from COVID-19 in this country, Trump’s spokeswoman divided the U.S. population by age to focus on those who contract the coronavirus, but survive, using exaggerated statistics. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters, “I think what you’re seeing is if you’re under 70, your chances of surviving are upwards of 99 percent and above 70 it’s still very close to that range because it’s a testament to remdesivir, dexamethazone and the president deregulating and making those possible. And we’re still hoping for a vaccine by the end of the year.”

Irwin Redlener of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University concedes some of the pandemic’s new U.S. wave was inevitable, but he tells The Associated Press that at least 130,000 of the nation’s more than 227,000 deaths could have been avoided had the country more widely embraced masks and social distancing. It’s why more governors and local officials are moving toward targeted interventions, such as mask mandates, tighter restrictions on group activities and some trial curfews.

Redlener was referring to a recent study published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine by researchers from the University of Washington's School of Medicine. They predicted that current state strategies surrounding social distancing, phased reopenings and mask mandates could lead to 511,373 deaths by Feb. 28. But the research also projected that nearly 130,000 lives could be saved from the end of September through the end of February if at least 95 percent of the U.S. population wore masks in public. If fewer people cooperated and only 85 percent wore masks, many deaths could still be avoided — nearly 96,000 deaths, according to the data (USA Today).

Medical experts in states with unrelenting surges in COVID-19 cases are alarmed at the strain on hospitals and medical teams, even before winter begins and populations move indoors. Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb warned on Wednesday that the United States is on a trajectory to match the rate of spread in European countries in about three weeks. Illustrating the strain, El Paso, Texas, is setting up a field hospital, and the Utah Hospital Association warned it might need to ration care (The Hill).

Advising states: Deborah Birx Deborah BirxFauci rips White House coronavirus approach The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Pollsters stir debate over Trump numbers The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Trump, Biden set for weekend swing state sprint MORE, a coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, has traveled to 40 states since August and logged more than 20,000 miles to reach small groups of state and local officials to talk about COVID-19, safety and school instruction, preparedness and best practices in an effort to respond to the pandemic under federal, state and local policy options (CNN).

Travel: The Associated Press: JetBlue is the latest airline to retreat from blocking seats as a precaution against COVID-19 transmission, yet another indication of financial pressures as fewer people travel by air.

Stockpiling: Bleak projections of COVID-19’s anticipated spread this winter are leading many Americans to stockpiling essential goods as they did when the pandemic began, while also thinking about hunkering down if the country explodes with tensions and turmoil. “I think that there are plenty of reasons for legitimate concern about disruptions,” said Baruch Fischhoff, professor in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at the Carnegie Mellon University. “Between the pandemic that seems to be surging around the country, without a strong assurance that it's being well controlled, and then there are people that are worried about some sort of unrest after the election” (The Hill).

CONGRESS: As in the movie “Casablanca,” Washington leaders say they are shocked, shocked, shocked that politics are part of the impasse over stimulus spending.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided? Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinDemocrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Trump, Biden set for weekend swing state sprint Mnuchin says he learned of Pelosi's letter to him about stimulus talks 'in the press' MORE engaged in a rare public back-and-forth, which featured the most stinging remarks the Treasury chief has made about his negotiating counterpart since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, as talks once again hit a standstill before Election Day.

The Thursday food fight started with a letter Pelosi sent to Mnuchin early on Thursday, pressing for Mnuchin and the White House to respond to the latest stimulus offer by Democrats warning that Washington's failure to act quickly on another round of disaster aid will only heighten the health and economic fallout as the pandemic surges around the country.

“Your responses are critical for our negotiations to continue,” Pelosi wrote to Mnuchin. ""The President’s words that ‘after the election, we will get the best stimulus package you have ever seen’ only have meaning if he can get [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE to take his hand off the pause button and get Senate Republican Chairmen moving toward agreement with their House counterparts.”

Later in the day, Mnuchin responded with a letter of his own, calling the Speaker’s letter a “political stunt” and criticizing her for refusing to negotiate on multiple provisions of a potential deal.

“Your ALL OR NONE approach is hurting hard-working Americans who need help NOW,” Mnuchin said.

The latest war of words comes ahead of a looming battle over another relief package during the lame-duck session of Congress once lawmakers reconvene after the election, though both parties believe it is more likely that they can strike a deal once election tensions have simmered down.

“The motivation level on both sides will depend on how the election comes out but I think either way we’ll do something. The question is how much,” Sen.

THE CLOSER

And finally … Congratulations to the politics-saturated winners of this week’s Morning Report Quiz! They supplied five correct answers without needing multiple choice prompts.

Here’s who recognized which major candidates and one surrogate evoked some ghosts of former U.S. presidents along with some American history this week: Ki Harvey, Stewart Baker, Hanley Smith, Patrick Kavanagh, Jack Barshay, Frank Hatfield, Don Wolfensberger, Terry Plfaumer, Matthew DeLaune, Donna Minter, Norm Roberts, J. Patrick White, Tom Miller, Pam Manges, David Letostak, Daniel Bachhuber, Enzo De Palma, Catherine Houston, John Donato, Kathy Petersen, Dara Umberger, Luther Berg and Rachel A. Tyree.

They knew that President Trump, while campaigning in Pennsylvania on Monday, said, ""You know we're the party of Abraham Lincoln, a lot of people don't know that. The great Abraham Lincoln, a man that I've always competed against.""

Democratic running mate Kamala Harris told a Nevada audience this week, “Let’s honor the ancestors, when this year we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. … Let’s also, you know, always remember history and facts: Black women couldn’t vote until 1965.”

Former President Obama, with sharp broadsides about his successor, told Florida voters on Monday, “I’ve sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president, and they’re very different people.”

Joe Biden traveled to Warm Springs, Ga., on Wednesday to call for national healing while evoking the 32nd president: “FDR longed to live an independent life, a life that wasn’t defined by his illness. … It was the lessons he learned here that he used to lift a nation.”

Vice President Pence, while in South Carolina on Tuesday, appealed to conservative voters with a pointed comparison to the 40th president: “Trump has signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.”",2020-10-30 06:37:13-04:00,
Finger-pointing picks up in COVID-19 relief fight,"The blame game is heating up as it becomes increasingly clear there will be no new COVID-19 relief deal before the elections.

Even as party leaders inch closer to a deal on another huge package, both sides are girding for the near-certain prospect that it won't be enacted before Election Day.

In a barrage of rhetorical broadsides, both parties are jabbing across the aisle, accusing the other of blocking the compromise that might otherwise bring emergency health and economic relief to millions of Americans before Nov. 3.

Trump and McConnell are firing back, accusing Pelosi of stonewalling to score political points by denying Trump a victory ahead of the election. And both parties are scrambling to protect vulnerable seats by casting the other as callous to the plight of suffering Americans — an eleventh-hour appeal to the sympathies of voters already heading to the polls.

There are risks for both parties. The fierce jockeying arrives as coronavirus cases are spiking around the country, jobless claims are on the rise, and neither side wants to bear the political backlash of inaction.

Pressed during Thursday’s debate why he can’t close a deal on a stimulus package, Trump immediately pointed his finger at Pelosi, whom he accused of playing politics with the victims of the pandemic.

And he predicted that House Democrats would pay a heavy price at the polls on Nov. 3, even though most election handicappers say there is virtually no chance of the GOP flipping the lower chamber.

“Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do,” Trump said during his debate with Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE in Nashville.

“That's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. … Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. … This one she doesn't want.

“It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically,” Trump added.

Pelosi, who’s leading the negotiations on another multitrillion-dollar relief package with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinDemocrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Trump, Biden set for weekend swing state sprint Mnuchin says he learned of Pelosi's letter to him about stimulus talks 'in the press' MORE, has responded in kind. On Thursday she went after McConnell, who has opposed another massive stimulus bill and remains cold to the idea of staging a Senate vote before Nov. 3, even if Pelosi and Mnuchin win a deal.

""I think it is in range for us to pass it before the election,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""But it's not up to me to decide what the Senate does.""

On Friday she voiced a similar sentiment, but blamed Trump for failing to press Senate Republicans to act with greater urgency.

“We're writing the bill and hopefully we'll be able to resolve some of the other differences,” Pelosi said in an interview with MSNBC. “We could do that before the election — if the president wants to.”

Shrouded by the partisan attacks is the politically inconvenient detail that both sides have a reason to delay any stimulus vote until after the election. With Trump trailing badly in the polls, many Democrats simply don't want to lend a boost to his campaign just before most voters cast a ballot.

""The election is less than two weeks away, and I believe we'll be back in Washington a week or two after the elections and we can do something there,” Rep.

For McConnell, who’s fighting to preserve his slim majority, a pre-election vote risks highlighting stark divisions between Senate Republicans — most of whom oppose another huge relief bill out of deficit spending concerns — and their party's standard bearer in the Oval Office, who is pressing for quick passage and retains enormous popularity with the GOP base. At a closed-door lunch in the Capitol on Tuesday, McConnell told his conference that he’d pressed the White House to resist any deal with Pelosi before Nov. 3.

The sum of factors has made it increasingly unlikely that any agreement will reach Trump’s desk before Election Day.

""There could be an agreement, and I wouldn't say that's outside the realm of possibility,” Sen. John Thune John Randolph ThuneSenate battle threatens to spill into overtime On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 MORE (S.D.), the Republican whip, told reporters Friday in the Capitol. “But I think in terms of trying to process it mechanically across the floor of the House and the Senate and get it passed, I'd say the odds would be long of that.""

Pelosi said Friday she’s still “optimistic” and that the two sides are close enough to “put pen to paper.” She’s directed her top committee chairmen to work out specific policy issues with their GOP counterparts. But there is still a wide chasm between Democrats and Republicans on two critical aspects of the package: emergency funding for cities and states, and liability protections demanded by McConnell.

Democrats brace for nail-biting finish to Senate battle,"Democrats are bracing for a down-to-the-wire fight for control of the Senate, with eight days left and a slew of toss-up races.

After getting burned in 2016, when they thought they would win the White House and the Senate majority, Democrats are being careful not to spike the football too early even as political handicappers give them good odds of winning back the chamber for the first time since 2014.

Democrats say they are optimistic, with a wider-than-expected playing field, but warn the battle for the majority is still too close to call in the final stretch.

“I’ve learned to be skeptical of all these polls,” Murphy said. “Obviously the playing field is huge, much bigger than we would have suspected. ... We have more pathways to get to the majority than we would have a year ago.”

A Democratic official involved in the Senate races compared the fight for which party will control the Senate majority to “more of a coin flip than a done deal,” even while Democrats have expanded the map compared to the start of the cycle when Republicans were viewed as the early favorites.

“We just can’t take anything for granted. ... Because of the states that we’re running in, the map is tougher than the presidential race,” the official added.

Democrats need to pick up a net total of three seats and the White House to win control of the Senate. Complicating their math, Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) is viewed as likely to lose his seat, after winning a 2017 special election, meaning they will likely need an actual gain of four seats to break even.

Beyond that, Democrats have also brought states such as Georgia, Montana and Iowa into play, while states like South Carolina, Kansas and Alaska have emerged as competitive races despite their deep red leanings.

“Chuck was feeling really good about having my job. ... He actually called me a day before the election and said he hoped we would have a really good working relationship. I called him up the day after the election and said, ‘I sure hope so,’” McConnell recounted in 2018.

But they aren’t ready to concede and are dropping a mountain of money in the final weeks.

Democrats hammer Trump for entertaining false birther theory about Harris,"President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE on Thursday drew swift backlash after he declined to disavow a baseless and racist conspiracy theory that Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden begins two-day campaign sprint in battleground Pennsylvania Trump praises Texas supporters who surrounded Biden-Harris bus FBI investigating Biden bus surrounded by pro-Trump cars: report MORE (D-Calif.) would not be eligible to serve as vice president.

Trump at a news conference was asked about an op-ed in Newsweek that was shared by an adviser to his campaign that raised the possibility Harris, who was born in Oakland, Calif., to immigrant parents, does not meet the requirements to hold the office.

The president, who spent much of then-President Obama's time in office pushing the racist and unfounded ""birther theory"" that he was not born in the United States, said he had ""no idea"" if Harris was ineligible to run for vice president.

""I just heard that. I heard it today, that she doesn’t meet the requirements,"" he said. ""And by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, talented lawyer.""

""I have no idea if that’s right. I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president,"" he continued. ""I don’t know about it. I just heard about it. I’ll take a look.""

Trump was referencing a Newsweek column by John Eastman, a conservative attorney who called into question the citizenship status of Harris's parents at the time of her birth. The column was retweeted by Jenna Ellis, a Trump campaign adviser.

Harris is eligible to hold the office of vice president. She is the first woman of color to be named to a major party's presidential ticket.

Democrats and some Trump critics were quick to hammer the president for entertaining the conspiracy theory about the senator.

""Donald Trump was the national leader of the grotesque, racist birther movement with respect to President Obama and has sought to fuel racism and tear our nation apart on every single day of his presidency,"" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign. ""So it’s unsurprising, but no less abhorrent, that as Trump makes a fool of himself straining to distract the American people from the horrific toll of his failed coronavirus response that his campaign and their allies would resort to wretched, demonstrably false lies in their pathetic desperation.""

Democratic lawmakers quickly piled on, accusing Trump of trafficking in racism.

Poll: Nearly 70 percent say election a 'significant source of stress',"Nearly two-thirds of Americans say next week's election is a ""significant source of stress,"" according to a survey released by the American Psychological Association (APA) released this month.

Sixty-eight percent of all adults say that the 2020 U.S. presidential election is a significant stressor, up 16 points from 2016, when 52 percent of adults said the same.

The feeling of anxiety surrounding the election does not differ greatly along party lines, with the majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents surveyed saying it is causing them stress.

Seventy-six percent of Democrats, 67 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of independents said that the Nov. 3 election is a ""significant source of stress.""

The survey results come amid a divisive political climate where tensions are high and there are concerns about the safety and validity of the election.

In the APA survey, 77 percent of adults said that the future of the nation was a source of stress, up from 11 points from 2019, when 66 percent of U.S. adults said the same.

Seventy-one percent of adults polled said that this was ""the lowest point in our nation's history that I can remember,"" compared to 56 percent of U.S. adults who said the same in 2019.

The survey was conducted online by the Harris Poll for the APA in the United States in both English and Spanish Aug. 4-26 among 3,409 adults over the age of 18.

It also comes as the U.S. has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected close to 9 million people in the country and killed almost 227,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

The pandemic has disrupted almost every aspect of life in the U.S., forcing children and young adults in many states to switch to online learning in schools and universities. Economic fallout from the pandemic has plunged college seniors and new graduates into uncertainty as they look for jobs.

Eighty-seven percent of Generation Z adults say that the disruption of their education due to the pandemic is a significant source of stress, and 82 percent of the same demographic say that uncertainty about what the 2020–2021 school year will be like causes them stress.

CIA impeachment whistleblower forced to live under surveillance due to threats: report,"The CIA analyst who was the whistleblower in President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s impeachment case was forced to live under strict security measures after receiving multiple threats, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.

The Post reported that the CIA’s Security Protective Service implemented the measures after they noticed violent threats on the internet every time the president mentioned the whistleblower, who has not been identified by the government.

Officials said the threats increased when Trump tweeted about the analyst. The president's allies also sought to reveal the person's identify, with Sen.

Whistleblowers enjoy federal protections against retribution for coming forward.

“The president was tweeting, ‘Where’s the whistleblower? Where’s the whistleblower?’” a former senior U.S. official involved in overseeing the whistleblower’s protection told the Post. The official said the analyst was never in immediate danger, but without security, “there is a strong possibility that grave harm would have come to him.”

Current and former U.S. officials told the newspaper that the analyst was living under CIA security in hotels, and that armed officers drove him to work in an unmarked vehicle. A security team had to make sure his apartment was safe before he was allowed in to get any items.

Officials told the Post that the threats have subsided, and that some measures were pulled back. However, other measures will likely stay in place, as the analyst continues to face online attacks, sources told the Post.

The Hill has reached out to the CIA for comment.

""I mean, we'll have to see if it's a problem, right? People are entitled to say maybe it was a problem, maybe it wasn't,"" he added.

The president had tweeted in April “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” due to Michigan’s coronavirus restrictions.

COVID-19 antibodies see drop in months following infection: study,"Coronavirus antibodies dropped by nearly 26 percent in the three months following infection, according to a new REACT2 study.

The research, published on Tuesday, surveyed a total of nearly 365,000 British adults from June through September. Almost 17,500 people in that group who tested positive for COVID-19 showed a decline in the presence of antibodies across all age groups.

“We know seasonal colds can reinfect people every six months,” Wendy Barclay, head of the infectious disease department at Imperial College London, told Politico, noting that the coronavirus appears to follow a similar trend.

Rates at which the antibodies decreased over time varied, according to Politico. Cases in which the infected person was asymptomatic showed a rapid drop, while younger people had high levels of antibodies and a slower decline and older people had lower levels of antibodies from the beginning.

“We don’t yet know what level of antibody is needed in a person’s blood to prevent reinfection,” Barclay said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) backtracked on earlier guidance that said the coronavirus had a three-month window of immunity following infection.

""People can continue to test positive for up to 3 months after diagnosis and not be infectious to others. Contrary to media reporting today, this science does not imply a person is immune to reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the 3 months following infection,” the CDC said in a press release in August.

Despite this, German virologist Christian Drosten believes that antigen testing could still be useful in combating COVID-19.

""We could develop a working hypothesis in public health,” he said, according to Politico. “A negative result of [an] antigen test predicts a waning of infectability in a patient.”",2020-10-27 10:34:13-04:00,

During a rally for Nick Freitas, a Republican candidate for Congress, in Central Virginia on Sunday, Paul suggested to a crowd that he would make the call himself if he had a restaurant.

""If I owned a restaurant, I’d have a whole wing for senior citizens or for anybody who is worried about getting sick, and I would say, 'All my servers have already had it,'"" Paul told the crowd, according to The Daily Beast. ""If I had a cruise ship ... everybody would have had the infection that works on the boat.""

Paul also referred to his previous coronavirus diagnosis during the rally, saying that once you've had COVID-19, you are immune.

“I’ve had it. I can’t get it again,” Paul said, according to The Daily Beast. “I can’t give it to you, and I can’t get it.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released guidance contradicting Paul's stance. People are not immune to reinfection after recovering from the coronavirus, according to the CDC.

Paul contracted COVID-19 in March. He has publicly maintained that those who have had the virus do not need a face mask.

“I’m not telling you not to wear a mask,” Paul reiterated at the rally, according to The Daily Beast. “The cloth masks … I’m just telling you the truth, they don’t work. Ninety-seven percent of viruses go through a cloth mask.”

President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE and former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE continue their battleground duel as they appear in key swing states in the countdown to Tuesday.

Biden, who remains the favorite to win the White House with six days remaining, made a show of strength as he campaigned in Georgia in a bid to flip the longtime GOP stronghold and carry Democratic candidates for Senate across the finish line.

“There aren’t a lot of pundits who would’ve guessed four years ago that a Democratic candidate in 2020 would be campaigning in Georgia on the final week of the election,” Biden told supporters at a rally in Atlanta. “Or that we’d have such competitive Senate races in Georgia. But we do because something’s happening here in Georgia and across America … people are coming together to transcend the old divides and show what’s possible.”

“We win Georgia, we win everything,” Biden added.

As The Hill’s Jonathan Easley writes, the former vice president is trying to expand his reach into states that have backed GOP presidential candidates for decades, including Arizona and Iowa, where Biden is set to campaign on Friday. Georgia, his destination as the final campaign week began, has not supported a Democrat for president since 1992.

According to the latest RealClearPolitics average, Trump and Biden are in a virtual tie in the Peach State (47.2 percent to 46.8 percent). One GOP operative told the Morning Report that Georgia is “as close, if not closer, than Florida, North Carolina, Arizona” in the late stages and that the Trump-Biden contest is a “deadlock” in the state. A Democratic aide with knowledge of internal polling added that Biden leads by 1 to 2 points.

The Hill: Biden calls Trump a “charlatan,” invokes former President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a speech promising to unite the nation.

While Biden rallied supporters down South, the president looked to lock down his standing in two Midwestern states that fueled his 2016 victory — Wisconsin and Michigan — in an attempt to recapture the magic of four years ago. However, he trails in both states, according to recent surveys.

At an appearance in Lansing, Mich., the president downplayed concerns over his standing in the polls, pointing to polls that show him up 3 points in the state, although it is unclear which poll he was referring to.

“I think we’re up a lot more,” Trump told rally goers. “We’re going to have a great red wave.”

Trump also campaigned in Omaha, Neb., on Tuesday night in an effort to repeat his victory in the state’s 2nd Congressional District and win the single electoral vote it hands out. The appearance doubled as a play for Iowa voters as the Omaha media market stretches into Western Iowa.

This morning’s surprise poll from ABC News-Washington Post: In Wisconsin, Biden leads the president by 17 percentage points (57 percent to 40 percent). The former vice president also holds a 7-point advantage in Michigan (51 percent to 44 percent), according to the newest survey.

The Washington Post: One week out, Biden imagines a post-Trump America and the president launches more attacks.

Aside from the trio of rallies, Trump’s attention was also trained in the direction of former President Obama, who headlined a rally in Florida on behalf of the former vice president.

Speaking to supporters in Orlando, Obama let loose on the president for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and panned White House senior adviser Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerTimes Square billboards featuring Ivanka Trump, Kushner moved to Florida before Election Day Trump says ex-staffer who penned 'Anonymous' op-ed should be 'prosecuted' Kushner told Woodward in April Trump was 'getting the country back from the doctors' MORE over remarks claiming that for Trump’s economic policies to work, Black Americans had to “want to be successful.”

“What's his closing argument? That people are too focused on COVID,” Obama said, referencing what has become a staple of Trump's rallies and Twitter feed. ""He said this at one of his rallies. 'COVID, COVID, COVID,' he's complaining. … He's jealous of COVID's media coverage” (The Hill).

“[Kushner] says Black folks have to want to be successful,” Obama said. “Who are these folks? What history books do they read? Who do they talk to?” (The Hill).

The remarks reprised a familiar role for Obama: as a troll of his successor. Trump reacted to his predecessor’s comments by complaining that Fox News broadcast the 44th president’s remarks (The Hill).

LEADING THE DAY





MORE POLITICS: Call them the shy Biden voters this cycle. Anti-Trump feelings in some communities mean Republicans who have never supported a Democratic candidate are filling out ballots for Biden while keeping that decision mostly to themselves, reports The Hill’s Amie Parnes. In 2016, some pollsters said hidden vows to vote for Trump were not detected in surveys before the election, although focus groups of likely voters talked openly about the phenomenon. “I'm not coming out and saying it,” one Palm Beach County Republican told The Hill recently about his decision to turn his back on his neighbor, the president. ""But I'm allowing people to connect the dots.” The Florida voter, who has never supported a Democratic candidate, said, ""It's not that I'm ashamed to vote for Biden. I know I'm doing the right thing. I just don't want it out there.”

While talking with Ohio suburban women voters this month, The New York Times’s The Daily podcast discovered similar reactions: Republican moms described how their disapproval of the president’s behavior and policies shifted their values along with their decisions to try to put Biden in the White House.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report moved the Senate race from “likely Republican” to “lean Republican” last week (The Hill).

> Election Day safety: Concerns about possible violence and unrest tied to 2020 election outcomes have been voiced by voters who fear the worst and government officials who say they’ll be prepared for demonstrations, reports The Hill’s Max Greenwood.

Worries are not unique to one political group. A poll from YouGov released earlier this month showed that a majority of voters – nearly 56 percent – expect to see an increase in violence after Election Day, including 53 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans. Skirmishes broke out between Trump supporters and foes in New York City on Sunday, leading to several arrests.

On Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to move into five cities ahead of Election Day, including Austin and San Antonio, as a precaution to keep the peace (San Antonio Express-News).

The Associated Press: Voters worry about safety at the polls.

> Wall Street & elections: Investors often prefer known unknowns and get the jitters about situations such as rising COVID-19 infections, recession, failure in Washington to enact legislation to inject more stimulus into the economy and a presidential election that could drag on with legal challenges until January. While Trump has warned that his defeat would bring a total collapse of the stock market, some Wall Street veterans believe markets could cruise under a Biden presidency if there’s a fiscal stimulus bill, low Federal Reserve interest rates and a massive federal investment in infrastructure, reports The Hill’s Sylvan Lane.

> Relief deal?: A stimulus deal is coming, but not until after Election Day. That was the message from the president on Tuesday as progress made in recent weeks has stalled over a COVID-19 testing strategy plan proposed by Democrats that has yet to be approved by the White House.

Speaking to reporters, Trump insisted negotiations will continue and predicted that the two sides will reach a deal.

“Nancy Pelosi is only interested in bailing out badly-run, crime-ridden Democrat cities and states. That’s all she is interested in,” Trump said. “She is not interested in helping the people.”

“After the election, we will get the best stimulus package you have ever seen,” Trump continued. “I think we are going to take back the House because of her” (The Hill).

Trump’s remarks sparked a response from the Speaker, who argued that Trump’s comments were a byproduct of White House chief of staff Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsSunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day Biden and Trump closing arguments diverge sharply on COVID-19 Democrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' MORE’s weekend declaration that “we’re not going to control the pandemic.”

While the Democratic leader kept his troops in line and from going too far in their attacks against the nominee, the simmering tensions with McConnell were fully apparent, with Schumer declaring that Monday, the day of Barrett's final confirmation vote, ""will go down as one of the darkest days in the 231-year history of the United States Senate.""

In response, McConnell returned fire, slamming Schumer for kicking off the judicial wars in the early 2000s and dismissing his complaints over Barrett's confirmation as “outlandish” and “utterly absurd.” Outside of floor debate, the relationship between the two leaders is minimal, as The Hill’s Alexander Bolton reports. The GOP leader has largely shut Schumer out of negotiations at key moments this year, declining to negotiate with him directly on the $2.2 trillion CARES Act earlier this year.

Politics has added to the frosty relationship; Schumer has made no bones about wanting McConnell’s post as majority leader.

Politico: No apologies: McConnell says Barrett a “huge success for the country.”

The Washington Post: McConnell insists his health is “just fine,” declines to explain what appears to be bruised hands.

> Senate: Tensions in the upper chamber are at an all-time high about potentially nixing the filibuster for legislation and expanding the Supreme Court next year if Democrats capture the majority. There are signs of significant shifts within the caucus on judicial reforms, even as Biden has said his approach, if elected, would be to weigh any judicial reforms with help from an independent commission that would represent a broad mix of stakeholders (The Hill). … Legal and congressional experts say packing the court would be a longshot endeavor, at best, and there’s a reason it has not been attempted since former President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s efforts (Bloomberg Law).

Several senators took to the floor on Saturday to discuss Barrett and spar over election interference, immigration, the coronavirus pandemic and voting rights.

Senators are working through the weekend on Barrett’s nomination. The upper chamber is expected to hold a key test vote on her nomination on Sunday, paving the way for her confirmation vote likely on Monday evening.

Republicans have defended their decision to confirm Barrett to the Supreme Court just days before the election, arguing that the political shift between 2016, when a Democrat was in the White House, and 2020, when Republicans control both the Senate and the presidency, is a key distinction.

Schumer, however, argued that the GOP push marked the “most unprincipled, partisan, most hypocritical, and least legitimate Supreme Court confirmation in our nation’s history.”

Though Supreme Court nominees have previously been confirmed during a presidential election year, Republicans will set a new record for how close this confirmation will be to Election Day. Though other nominees have been confirmed in a fewer number of days, they were further away from the election.

Democrats tried at several points during Saturday’s session to shift the Senate away from Barrett’s nomination and toward taking up a litany of legislative proposals, including a House-passed coronavirus bill, a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and immigration, election interference and suicide prevention-related legislation.

Each of the efforts were blocked by Republican senators, who argued that the Senate should focus on the task at hand: Confirming Barrett to the Supreme Court.

“The minority leader is requesting to move to legislation after having repeatedly this week requested and asked for votes to adjourn, multiple times, leave town. Now all of the sudden he wants to legislate. I think there’s a serious question about the sincerity of the minority leader’s request here,” Sen.

Murkowski, part of the chamber’s fledging moderate coalition, was considered a vote to watch because she had previously said that she did not believe a nominee should be brought up before the Nov. 3 election.

""While I oppose the process that has led us to this point, I do not hold it against her as an individual who has navigated the gauntlet with grace, skill and humility. I will vote no on the procedural votes ahead of us but yes to confirm Judge Barrett when the question before us is her qualification to be an associate justice,"" Murkowski said.

In just the past week, the president has shifted from chief cheerleader for a massive deal to principal pessimist undermining any such agreement — only to reverse course yet again on Friday in urging the top negotiators to “go big” in securing a package he can sign before the elections.

“I would like to see a bigger stimulus package, frankly, than either the Democrats or the Republicans are offering,” he said in a two-hour interview with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.

The stunning 360-degree turn has given rise to new hopes that, after weeks of stalled talks, the White House and Democrats can unite to pass emergency relief in the range of $2 trillion to help states, families and businesses being crushed under the weight of a pandemic that’s already killed more than 210,000 people in America and left millions more unemployed.

Yet Trump’s message is not only at odds with statements he made just days ago, but also contradicts those from Senate Republicans and some of his own White House aides, who are warning that any new spending package would have to come in lower than the Democrats’ $2.2 trillion proposal — and certainly won’t be higher, as Trump pitched to Limbaugh.

“We are willing and eager to make a deal and we’re willing to come up on the levels that we’re giving in terms of direct payments to the American people, potentially PPP loans, as well as airline aid,” White House communications director Alyssa Farah told reporters Friday afternoon, referring to the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides loans to small businesses. “We want to keep that number below $2 trillion.”

It’s not unusual for Trump to play a wildcard role in Washington policy debates, but his hot-and-cold approach to the stimulus negotiations has confused all sides.

Trump is hoping to restore an image of strength and dealmaking prowess, after spending three days in the hospital being treated for COVID-19, providing clear motivation to secure a big victory ahead of the election. But top Republicans in both chambers have been cool to the idea of piling trillions of dollars more onto the federal debt, and they’re busy tamping down expectations that an enormous new spending package is possible less than four weeks from Nov. 3. Their comments have raised questions about whether Congress can pass such a bill even if a deal with the White House is struck.

Another factor likely driving Senate Republicans is this: Trump is down in the national polls — trailing Democratic nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE by double digits, according to some new surveys — and GOP operatives appear increasingly willing to buck his demands as the days tick closer to the elections.

“I got the sense from them that there’s a ‘let’s cut him loose' [attitude],” a former Democratic aide now working in a bipartisan consulting shop said in an email. “I strongly believe that if Pelosi and Munchin cut a deal it may not get the Senate [support]. Weird, but it’s the first time that [Trump’s] lap dogs may be getting some backbone or better yet self-preservation when they see him tanking.”

Amid the turmoil, negotiations have continued. Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided? Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinDemocrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Trump, Biden set for weekend swing state sprint Mnuchin says he learned of Pelosi's letter to him about stimulus talks 'in the press' MORE held a 30-minute phone call Friday afternoon on which the Treasury secretary offered a $1.8 trillion package, up from $1.6 trillion a week ago. From Democrats’ perspective, that was a step in the right direction and a sign that Trump is extremely eager to cut a deal this month.

But Pelosi has continued to insist on a $2.2 trillion package like the one House Democrats passed last week, and there was no indication from the Speaker on Friday that she was prepared to accept the White House’s counteroffer. The Friday phone call was shorter than previous calls between the two negotiators, and a top Pelosi aide said Democrats were still waiting for the administration to address specific concerns, including assurances that funding allocated for testing is actually spent on that purpose.

“Today, the secretary returned to the table with a proposal that attempted to address some of the concerns Democrats have,” said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill. “Of special concern, is the absence of an agreement on a strategic plan to crush the virus. For this and other provisions, we are still awaiting language from the administration as negotiations on the overall funding amount continue.”

In addition to his own plummeting polls, Trump is feeling growing pressure from moderate House and Senate Republicans facing tough reelection bids. Rep. John Katko John Michael KatkoWarren, Porter to headline progressive fundraiser supporting seven swing state candidates Trump fuels and frustrates COVID-19 relief talks Trump says talks on COVID-19 aid are now 'working out' MORE (R-N.Y.), whose race top election handicappers moved into the “toss up” column this week, told Trump on Twitter to “rethink his move” after the president walked away from talks earlier in the week.

And Sen. Joni Ernst Joni Kay ErnstOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress MORE (R-Iowa), who’s trailing Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield in the polls, personally pleaded with Trump on Friday to get a deal done on a relief package.

“Spoke to @POTUS and relayed to him what I’ve heard from folks across the state: Iowans need additional COVID-19 relief,” Ernst tweeted. “I’m hopeful Congress can come together once again — Rs and Ds — and provide more support to hardworking Americans.”

In its $1.8 trillion offer, the White House made new concessions to Pelosi and the Democrats. The proposal includes $300 billion in emergency aid for cities and states, up from a $250 billion offer last week (though still well below the Democrats’ $436 billion ask). The White House is also throwing in more money for airlines, restaurants, small businesses, unemployment insurance, food stamps and additional food aid for low-income women and children, according to a GOP source familiar with the offer.

Republicans are also offering direct payments of $1,000 per child — up from their initial $500 offer — in addition to the $1,200 stimulus checks for individuals, to give immediate relief to families rather than rely on future tax credits outlined in Pelosi’s plan.

“I don’t know what there is to say no to,” the GOP source said.

Pelosi, for her part, has not weighed in directly on the Republicans’ new offer. And it’s unclear that, with Trump on the ropes, she’s ready to come down from her firm demand of $2.2 trillion.

“You know the devil and the angels are in the details,” Pelosi told MSNBC shortly before her conversation with Mnuchin. “So, part of it is about money and part of it is about policy.”

“Now that the negotiators are back at the table, let’s get a bipartisan deal across the finish line.

Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.), who for weeks has downplayed the chances of reaching an agreement, was offering a more bullish tone Friday.

“I'm trying to figure out here whether I should predict another bill quickly or not. But the talks have speeded up in the last couple of days,” he said during an event in Kentucky. ""I think we're closer to getting an outcome.""

Not everyone is so confident. House lawmakers raced out of town on Friday for a six-week recess without reaching a bipartisan agreement on any new stimulus, and many were pessimistic that, after weeks of stalled talks, any such deal will materialize before the Nov. 3 elections.

“I don't think this changes anything,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.).

Trump's diagnosis, announced in the early hours of Friday, has sent shockwaves across the country, upending the presidential election, rattling Wall Street and creating new waves of jittery Americans racing to get coronavirus tests. On Friday afternoon, the president was ushered to Walter Reed Medical Center in Maryland for treatment via Marine One.

For some of those advocating the loudest for a bipartisan agreement, the president’s illness sparked new hopes that the sides will reach an elusive deal.

“Time will tell, but I think if anything, it might actually be that final dose of inspiration necessary to bring both sides together and ensure something gets done,” said Rep.

Upping the pressure on Pelosi, the moderate Blue Dog Democrats sent a letter Friday urging her “to continue the discussions over the weekend until a deal is achieved.”

“By definition, this compromise bill will contain provisions we as Democrats do not like and omit provisions we want,” the group wrote. “But our country is in crisis, and we must not let the perfect become the enemy of the good.”

In many respects, the business and rhetoric of Capitol Hill appeared to be unchanged, as the partisan clashes that have prevented an agreement continued to define the debate — and to undermine it.

Democrats sought to use Trump as an example of how disdain for preventative measures — masks, avoiding crowds — can spread the virus. Republicans raced to Trump's defense, rejecting any notion that the president had acted irresponsibly. And House lawmakers headed home without voting on emergency legislation that can win Trump’s signature.

The Trump diagnosis capped a wild week of bipartisan negotiations on a relief package. Pelosi and Mnuchin held a flurry of phone calls, including a lengthy 65-minute call on Friday afternoon — a sign that the two sides were still working toward a deal even as lawmakers dashed down the Capitol steps to catch flights home so they could return to the campaign trail.

“I’m optimistic. I’m always optimistic,” Pelosi told MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle. “We always have to find a path. That is our responsibility to do so, and I believe that we will.”

On Thursday, House Democrats had approved a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill, though it was rejected by every Republican and 18 moderate Democrats frustrated to be voting on legislation with no chance of being enacted. Mnuchin has offered a $1.6 trillion counter-proposal, but even that figure is likely to scare away Republicans in the Senate, where McConnell has warned that a White House endorsement is no guarantee the bill will be considered.

Friday’s conversation between Pelosi and Mnuchin followed a pair of calls Thursday and a 90-minute in-person meeting in the Capitol on Wednesday that raised questions about whether the key negotiators may have been exposed to the virus since Mnuchin frequently sees Trump. But spokespeople for both Pelosi, who is second in line to the presidency, and Mnuchin, who is fifth in line, said Friday that both had tested negative.

Still, the new outbreak touched all aspects of the nation’s capital on Friday. Around noon, the normally quiet COVID-19 testing site outside the National Building Museum had about 50 people standing in line for a nasal swab. At least three journalists who work at the White House tested positive for COVID-19, according to the White House Correspondents Association.

Complicating the pathway to a deal, neither side seems to trust the other to be an honest broker. Republicans have hammered Pelosi throughout the talks, accusing her of consistently changing the goalposts in order to prevent billions of dollars from going out the door, which could help Trump’s reelection bid.

Across the aisle, Democrats fired back, noting that Trump has taken a decidedly hands-off approach to negotiations, deputizing Mnuchin to haggle the details even as polls show the pandemic — and the president’s response to it — have threatened his reelection bid.

A handful of other Democratic voices, however, joined Pelosi in saying the national focus on Trump’s condition could give a fresh boost of momentum to the sputtering talks.

“I think this puts more into focus the importance of getting a deal to help people to fight COVID.

“He made his statement prefaced by ‘this will probably be on Twitter in a few minutes,’” said a GOP senator recounting Tuesday’s meeting.

A majority of Republican senators oppose a bigger coronavirus relief package, even as Trump pushes for one.

“Mitch understands his troops,” the senator said. “He’s made the calculation that it’s not helpful to bring it to the floor because it would show we’re not on the same page as the president. There would be a lot of Republican no's.""

It’s just one of the emerging differences between the two pillars of GOP power in Washington.

Republican lawmakers also have concerns about the management of Trump’s reelection campaign, ranging from his performance during the first debate, to its cash shortage, to the president’s tendency to highlight politically divisive topics instead of focus on the issues.

Trump’s campaign has had increasing trouble raising money as donors have started to shift their resources to saving the Senate GOP majority and building a firewall against the possibility of a Democratic-controlled White House and House. Trump’s grass-roots fundraising arm is working harder and spending more on every dollar it raises compared to earlier this year.

There’s no real question of McConnell’s loyalty to Trump.

He has publicly predicted that Trump will win reelection and has pulled out all the stops to confirm Trump’s nominee, Amy Coney Barrett Amy Coney BarrettThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law If it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Pittsburgh newspaper backs Trump in first GOP presidential endorsement since 1972 MORE, to the Supreme Court before the Nov. 3 election, something the president wanted.

McConnell also told reporters Tuesday that he would likely put a Trump-backed coronavirus-relief deal on the Senate floor, even though it is likely to draw significant opposition from members of his conference.

At the same time, GOP senators say the dynamics also illustrate a reality that many of them aren’t sure Trump, who is trailing Democratic nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE in polls two weeks before Election Day, will be around after Jan. 20.

“There is this growing sense that if it’s more likely that Republicans retain the majority and the president is not reelected, then obviously McConnell becomes the most powerful Republican in Washington,” said a second Republican senator.

McConnell is also up for reelection this year and has been a top Democratic target, but GOP senators feel confident he’ll win reelection. A new Mason-Dixon poll published Wednesday showed McConnell leading his Democratic challenger, Amy McGrath, by 9 points.

Trump’s position is much more precarious as polls show him trailing in a slew of key battleground states including Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

“The leader’s been very helpful. Obviously, we continue to stay engaged with the leader on a regular basis. And so I don’t know that there’s any blame to be put on Leader McConnell or the administration in terms of our discussions together,” he told reporters.

“He knows where the votes are. As much as we all want to get a deal, a deal that would pass in the Senate with all Democratic votes and a handful of Republicans is not an outcome the leader would like to make happen. He’d like to see a deal where you get a majority of Republicans in support of policies that we actually think are good in terms of addressing the virus,” he said.

Thune has said on several occasions recently that he doesn’t think there are even 13 Republican votes to pass a package along the lines of what Mnuchin and Pelosi are currently discussing.

Democrats control 47 seats in the Senate and would need at least 13 Republicans to pass a package packed full of their priorities, such as Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, which are under discussion.

Republican senators warned Meadows during a lunch meeting Wednesday not to chase a deal with the Democrats if Pelosi continues to ratchet up the price tag of the package.

McConnell has publicly checked Trump in other ways.

The GOP leader admonished the president a few weeks ago for not condemning white supremacist groups such as the Proud Boys after Trump’s first debate with Biden.

He also was quick to put out a statement late last month pledging “an orderly transition of power” after Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost the presidential election.

With control of the White House and Senate at risk, some Senate Republicans are putting their own political livelihoods ahead of Trump’s, making a case that donors should prioritize building a firewall in the Senate.

The second Republican senator said it’s “the sense among my colleagues” that Republicans have a better chance of keeping control of the Senate because “that’s something we can somewhat control,” while they have little control over how Trump runs his campaign.

“Maybe Republicans are kind of promoting that possibility because then our money becomes more of a priority,” the senator added, referring to the importance of a Senate GOP firewall if Biden wins the presidency.

Some Republican donors also see a Senate GOP majority as a better bet than a Trump second term.

Dan Eberhart, a major Republican donor, told NBC News last month that “big donors are increasingly focused on the Senate.”

Democrats on edge as Biden-Trump fight nears end,"Democrats are on edge going into the final days of the general election campaign, but say they believe Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE has been doing enough to win the White House and defeat President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE.

“We’re all f---ing nervous as shit,” one Democratic strategist said. “But the stars aligned for us, I think. And I think that’s good enough. I think we’ll have a different outcome this time around. I hope so, anyway.”

Much of the apprehension for Democrats is rooted in the shocking defeat by Trump in 2016, when they expected their nominee, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE, to win but she fell short.

There have also been grumblings about Biden’s light travel schedule and the campaign’s organizing and door-knocking operation beginning later than usual due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Still, as the Democratic strategist said, “I think it’ll be enough to put us over the finish line.”

They also say that while they are nervous, this cycle feels different than 2016.

Biden has been campaigning in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the three states that cost Clinton, and most polls show him with a durable lead.

He is also contending in Iowa, Ohio and Florida, along with states seen as long shots for Democrats, such as Texas and Georgia.

All of those states are seen as toss-ups, as is Arizona, another state won by Trump in 2016.

Wins in any of them could give Biden some breathing room.

“After 2016, Democrats will never again feel confident about where they stand, even when the data paints a clear picture,” said Democratic strategist Mike Morey, who served as a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerDemocrats on edge as Biden-Trump fight nears end Reestablishing American prosperity by investing in the 'Badger Belt' House Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education MORE (D-N.Y.).

“That said, the map is as wide as it ever has been and the polling has shown remarkable consistency, with little-to-no fluctuation. Vice President Biden has approached the final weeks of this campaign with the kind of balance that we need –and have been missing –in the White House.”

Biden, who will turn 78 next month, spent much of the general election sidelined because of the pandemic, which Democrats say was both positive and negative for the Democratic nominee.

It would set the tone of his campaign, telegraphing to voters that Biden and his team believed in following science and social distancing at rallies. It also intentionally served as a contrast to Trump, who defied guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and held rallies with thousands of jam-packed supporters. At the same time, it kept Biden off the campaign trail, where he could make headlines and draw cable news commentary.

Because of the pandemic, Biden’s campaign was also late to traditional organizing including door-knocking and in-person interactions. At the start of the fall, they surprised Democrats — including former aides to former President Obama — by saying they would run an all-virtual organizing operation. After seeing the consternation it had caused, Biden’s camp quickly reversed course.

But some say they wonder if it was all enough.

“Biden ran the campaign he was comfortable running,” Democratic strategist Michael Trujillo said, adding that he still has some doubts about the outreach to Hispanic voters.

“I believe given a pandemic he has done everything he could do to get voters to vote, but we all know the gold standard is door knocking, let’s hope they knocked on enough doors to win,” he said.

That is a sentiment echoed by other Democrats who for months have openly wondered about how Biden could keep up with an opponent who was constantly on the move.

As recently as this month, as Biden sought to run out the clock with leads in most battleground states, Democrats privately opined that he should be doing more.

“Staying in the basement or even in Delaware wasn’t an option,” said one mega donor at the time. “They knew they had to do more.”

ADVERTISEMENT

This week, that donor was feeling more optimistic. “I’m glad he is going to all the swing states,” the donor said earlier this week.

Democratic strategist Joel Payne said he thinks “Democrats are set up to have a good night on Tuesday, from Joe Biden all the way down the ballot.”

Still, Democrats are bracing for the unknown, Payne said, including the possibility of voter suppression.

“We know the president is going to restrict ballot access and try to throw out votes,” Payne said. “There must be no back down from the get out the vote efforts and the fight to protect voters from Republican efforts to suppress and disenfranchise.”

Jon Favreau, who served as a chief speechwriter to President Obama during his administration and on both of his presidential campaigns, said he was “hopeful” about the election during his “Pod Save America” podcast.

“I’m not optimistic or pessimistic because optimism is guessing what might happen. I am hopeful,” he said. “Because hope is about believing that you can make something happen.”",2020-10-31 17:00:06-04:00,

During a rally in West Bend, Wis., she accused the Democrats of working with the media to “attack the administration” rather than “unifying our country and coming together in this time of need.”

“It was Joe Biden who accused President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE of xenophobic hysteria for putting the American people first and closing travel from China and parts of Europe,” she said. “Now, they are saying we didn’t do enough.

“Our actions say otherwise,” she added.

Since COVID-19 first hit the country earlier this year, the United States has recorded more than 9 million confirmed cases and more than 230,000 deaths a result of the virus, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

The first lady in her remarks Saturday compared her husband to his Democratic rival, arguing, “President Trump isn’t a career politician like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,” prompting boos and chants from the crowd of supporters.

“He’s a president with proven results, not empty words and broken promises,” she continued. “I watch Donald continue to work hard to keep people informed and calm, to protect our economy and make hard and unpopular decisions to do all he could to keep us all safe.”

“Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the rest of the Democrats and the media have spent almost the same amount of time and energy attempting to impeach my husband as we have spent fighting COVID-19,” she claimed. “Yet Joe Biden says he could do a better job leading our great nation.”

The first lady then joked, “When you hide in a basement, you feel safe communicating your wishful thinking,” referring to the Biden team opting for a focus on social media campaigning earlier this year as the former vice president remained at his home in Delaware because of concerns about spreading the coronavirus.

Her appearance in Wisconsin follows her remarks alongside President Trump at his campaign rally in Tampa, Fla., on Thursday.

""In a time when hate, negativity and fear are the messages the media streams into our homes and the large tech companies are protecting political censorship, we need to remember what is really important,"" she said at Thursday's rally. ""My husband’s administration is focused on the future.""

The president at one point mocked Biden as ""a touchy-feely guy,"" and the crowd broke into a chant of ""Creepy Joe."" President Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women.

""Our incredible first lady is sitting here right now, and she’s saying to herself, 'I wonder if all rallies are like this,'"" he joked.

The president narrowly won Wisconsin in 2016, flipping a state that had not gone for a Republican presidential nominee since 1984. Biden currently holds a single-digit lead in the Badger State in recent polling.

The first lady's appearances come after she remained largely absent from the campaign trail for months, even as the president has continued to trail Biden in national polls.",2020-10-31 14:57:30-04:00,

Speaking at the drive-in rally — a format that has become popular with Democrats during the coronavirus pandemic — Obama delivered a scathing assessment of President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s tenure in the White House, hammering the incumbent’s “reality show” style of politics and accusing him of focusing more on self-glorification than on the duties of his office.

“He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself or his friends or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show to give him the attention that he craves,” Obama said. “But unfortunately, the rest of us have to live with the consequences.”

By contrast, Obama cast Biden as an empathetic and hardworking public servant who had helped guide him through some of the biggest decisions of his eight years in the White House.

“I can tell you that the presidency doesn’t change who you are. It shows who are you. It reveals who you are,” Obama said. “And for eight years, Joe was the last one in the room when I made a big decision.”

The rally in Flint, the first of two in Michigan scheduled for Saturday, marked Obama’s first joint appearance with Biden since the former vice president formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in August.

The former president maintained a relatively low profile throughout much of the 2020 race, only endorsing Biden in April after he had all but clinched the Democratic nomination. But Obama has ramped up his appearances on the campaign trail in recent weeks, stumping for Biden in key battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Florida and now Michigan.

Biden’s campaign announced earlier Saturday that Obama would appear at events in Georgia and Florida on Monday.

Nearly four years after leaving the White House, Obama remains one of the most popular and influential Democrats in the country. His star power was on display on Saturday, with rallygoers honking their car horns frequently and several shouting “I love you” at the former president.

While Obama used his speech in Flint to talk up Biden’s character and qualifications, he took particular aim at Trump, at times criticizing his successor in personal terms. He cast Trump as concerned only about his own ego and mocked the president’s longtime obsession with the size of the crowds at his events.

“What is his obsession, by the way, with crowd size? You notice that?” Obama said. “This is the one measure he has of success. He’s still worried about his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine. It really bugged him. He’s still talking about that.”

“Did nobody come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Is he traumatized?” the former president continued. “What’s with crowds?”

Obama also slammed what he called Trump’s “closing argument” — that the media and American voters are “too focused” on the coronavirus pandemic, which has now infected more than 9 million people in the U.S. and killed 230,000.

“‘COVID, COVID, COVID,’ he’s complaining. He’s jealous of COVID’s media coverage. And now he’s accusing doctors of profiting off of this pandemic,” Obama said, referring to Trump’s baseless claim on Friday that doctors had profited off of the coronavirus pandemic by intentionally inflating the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

“He does not understand the notion that somebody would risk their lives to save others without making a buck,” Obama said.

Obama is slated to appear alongside Biden in Detroit later Saturday. The back-to-back rallies in Michigan are designed to rally last-minute support for Biden’s presidential bid in a state that Trump carried narrowly in 2016 and that Democrats see as a critical part of their path to the White House.

Most recent polling out of the state shows Biden leading Trump by high single digits, with a survey from The New York Times and Siena College released just this week putting the former vice president 8 points ahead of his Republican rival.

“I think that people are looking at the security issues if you live in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs,” Thune told The Hill.

He thinks Trump’s law-and-order message will play well with suburban voters concerned about the rioting and looting in the city after the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis in late May.

Paul Goren, a professor of political science at the University of Minnesota, said Trump “came really, really close” to winning Minnesota four years ago.

“Minnesota has a long history of this kind of independent streak and support for populism,” he said, pointing to former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura’s surprising win in the 1998 gubernatorial race. “In a normal election cycle, that sort of populist streak and anti-incumbent tendency — that’s always kind of a wild card.""

“I think it’s less of a wild card in the current election environment because Trump has been the incumbent, he has a record to run on,” he added.

A Survey USA poll conducted from Oct. 23 to 27 for KSTP-TV in the Twin Cities showed Biden with a 5-point lead, 47 percent to 42 percent.

Trump is unlikely to win a second term without winning the Sunshine State, a richly diverse mix of peninsula and panhandle that he put in his column with a margin of just 113,000 votes four years ago. Polls suggest he has the barest whisper of a lead against the former vice president in a state with 29 electoral votes.

Biden also will campaign today in heavily Democratic Broward County in South Florida, considered key to his chances to capture the “half-percent state.” The former vice president was there on Oct. 13, and former President Obama stumped for the Democratic ticket in Central and South Florida in the past few days, working to increase turnout among young and minority voters.

Trump will rally supporters in Fayetteville, N.C., this evening, returning to another toss-up state he desperately wants to win. Cumberland County is considered the bellwether in North Carolina for the president’s ambitions to lock up 15 electoral votes (Citizen Times).

Friday will see the two candidates jetting around the Midwest. In addition to Wisconsin, Trump is scheduled to return to Michigan and Minnesota, and Biden will make his third visit to the Badger State and dash into Iowa to try to expand his map. On Saturday, Biden will also return to Michigan, where he leads Trump in polls and will be accompanied by Obama (The Hill).

The Hill: No one gets under Trump’s skin like the 44th president.

Trump’s campaign team is concerned that a combination of shifting demographics, an anti-Trump upswell in some Midwestern suburbs and the impact of COVID-19 in parts of the Rust Belt have altered the political landscape compared with 2016. Biden has not let a day go by without hammering Trump over his response to the pandemic, gaining traction with college educated and minority voters in battleground states where infections have been soaring.

Wisconsin officials and public health experts say the state is in serious trouble with the coronavirus. The state has seen an average of 4,221 cases per day over the past week, an increase of 46 percent from earlier this month. Hospitals are buckling under the strain of packed ICUs and exhausted clinicians and staff.

A recent Marquette University poll found that only 40 percent of likely voters in Wisconsin approve of Trump’s handling of the pandemic while 57 percent say they are very worried or somewhat worried about contracting COVID-19 (Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel).

During a campaign stop in Flint, Mich., on Wednesday, Vice President Pence reminded supporters that the state will “play an outsized role in deciding this election, make no mistake about it.” When the crowd started chanting “Vote for Trump,” the vice president said, “We just got to make sure Michigan comes through.”

In Michigan over the past week, there have been an average of 2,334 cases of coronavirus infections each day, an increase of 83 percent from the average recorded just two weeks ago.

Poll watch: Biden maintains a 5-point lead over Trump in Wisconsin, according to a poll of likely voters conducted by Marquette Law School (The Hill).

Biden — whose campaign travel schedule has been described by some as prudently measured during a pandemic and others as too Delaware-rooted — spent part of Wednesday talking remotely to health experts about COVID-19, to local interviewers in Florida and Nevada, and to Oprah Winfrey Oprah Gail WinfreyThe Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Trump, Biden blitz battleground states NYT security guard who went viral for interaction with Biden will have prominent role at convention: report Louisville Breonna Taylor billboard erected by Oprah Magazine vandalized with red paint MORE during a Zoom event to encourage people to vote in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio (Deadline).

The Hill: Campaigning on Wednesday in GOP territory in Arizona, the president promised swift economic recovery and boasted the country is making headway against the virus. “We will deliver record prosperity, epic job growth, and a safe vaccine is coming very quickly,” Trump told supporters in Bullhead City. “We are rounding the turn regardless, you know that.”

Unprecedented turnout: More than 16 million voters who did not cast a ballot in 2016 have already voted this year, a sign that record-high enthusiasm in November’s elections will lead to an unprecedented turnout across the country. Already this year, more than 4 million people between the ages of 18 and 29 have cast ballots, suggesting the surge is partly fueled by younger voters who have been targets of turnout operations funded by Democratic groups, and by minorities who are motivated to turn out in large numbers (The Hill).

More than 76 million Americans have already voted, according to the U.S. Elections Project, representing nearly 56 percent of the 2016 turnout.

NPR: Election officials on Wednesday urged voters to use alternatives other than the U.S. mail to return ballots, noting that in many states, it is now too late to mail absentee ballots and be confident of receipt on time. They encourage voters to deliver their ballots by hand to appropriate elections offices or to cast ballots in person by Nov. 3. Absentee ballots must be received on Election Day in more than two dozen states, including a handful of key swing states such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin.

The Supreme Court late Wednesday declined to block lower court rulings that allow six extra days for accepting ballots sent by mail in North Carolina.

> Lone Star revamp?: Texas Republicans tell The Hill that even if Trump wins next week, the party has to rethink its direction as Democrats make inroads in Texas districts, particularly in suburban areas that have seen eye-popping growth during the past decade.

The Morning Report’s Al Weaver, reporting from Bulverde, Texas, says that while Trump is expected to win “ugly"" in Texas next week (as Dave Carney, a top adviser to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), put it), the coming years represent a make-or-break stretch for the Texas GOP to get its act together, party leaders say, with the Democrats expected to flip more U.S. House and state House seats next week.

“The party's got some work to do, and the reason they've got work to do is when you win the national championship every year — year after year after year — you get complacent,” former Texas Gov. Rick Perry Rick PerryThe Memo: Texas could deliver political earthquake The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Trump, Biden blitz battleground states Texas Republicans sound post-2020 alarm bells MORE (R) told The Hill in an interview.

“I think the Republican Party in Texas over the last 1- years … got complacent,” Perry continued, taking some responsibility for the situation, as he was governor from 2000 to 2014. “You didn't build the structure that you need. You didn't go recruit the bench that you need to continue to be a strong team.”

> Election night: Television projections of election winners and losers soon after polls close is a modern construct, not an expectation that all ballots are scanned, tallied and certified on Election Day. Elections experts are worried that Trump’s insistence on results on Nov. 3 is a ploy to disenfranchise voters, and they were surprised and disturbed when Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughIf it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Vermont secretary of State says Kavanaugh's correction still unsatisfactory Kavanaugh corrects opinion in voting case following Vermont official's objection MORE referred to states that ""want to be able to definitively announce the results of the election on election night” (The Hill). In fact, no state definitively announces results immediately after polls close, and each state by law complies with deadlines by which they must certify their election results, varying from a day to two days after Election Day to weeks later in December (Ballotpedia list). Political scientists and election law experts counsel patience this year, pointing out that presidential election results were in suspense in 2000 until Dec. 12 and in 2004 until the morning after election night because of a close outcome in Ohio.

Anonymous footnote: Back in September 2018, an unidentified Washington opinion writer inside the Trump administration caused a media stir with a New York Times piece in which the person, cast as a “senior official,” claimed to be part of a “resistance” to the president inside the government, working to “thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.” The federal employee remained hidden (some would say forgotten), even after enterprising publishing agents turned the political intrigue into a book deal (The Washington Post). “We took a meeting with a senior Trump official not sure about the meeting’s purpose, and when they informed us they were Anonymous, our jaws hit the floor,"" one of the wheeler-dealer agents gushed in 2019. Fast forward to Wednesday, and the “senior official” turns out to be farther down the anonymity ladder than imagined, sparking outrage from Trump supporters and shrugs from those who bought into the suspense. The official turned out to be former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor, who endorsed Biden this summer and previously denied writing either the opinion article or the book, titled “A Warning.”







IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES





CORONAVIRUS: Bad and getting worse … The United States and Europe face new rounds of shutdowns and restrictions amid frightening surges of COVID-19 infections and rising hospitalizations in nearly all states (The Associated Press). “I’m just coming from a place with ventilators and people are just going to an indoor restaurant,” said David Letzer, an infectious diseases specialist who doubles as chairman of the Wisconsin Medical Society’s COVID-19 task force. “Those are the things that are frustrating and take their toll.”

European nations moved to reimplement lockdowns amid grim coronavirus case numbers and to prevent hospitals from being overrun with COVID-19 patients needing intensive care. More than 2 million new confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported globally in the past week, the shortest time ever for such an increase, and 46 percent of those were in Europe, The Associated Press reported.

French President Emmanuel Macron Emmanuel Jean-Michel MacronPriest in France shot and injured, two days after knife attack in church UK's Boris Johnson considering new lockdown amid rising COVID-19 numbers Third person taken into custody after attack at French church MORE announced a partial nationwide shutdown would be implemented starting Friday. The lockdown will be reexamined every 15 days, with schools remaining open. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel made a similar move, instituting an emergency month long lockdown that shutters restaurants, gyms and theaters (Reuters).

Walt Disney World on Wednesday laid off 720 actors and singers as the theme park has not resumed live shows and entertainment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The news comes weeks after Walt Disney Co. announced that it was laying off 28,000 people at theme parks in Florida and California (The Associated Press).

The NFL is planning on capping capacity at Super Bowl LV at 20 percent, with roughly 13,000 to 15,000 fans expected at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, fans will be in pods 6 feet apart and masks will be mandatory (ESPN). ...The University of Wisconsin was forced to cancel Saturday’s football game against the University of Nebraska due to an outbreak of COVID-19 cases, with Wisconsin reporting 12 cases, including head coach Paul Chryst, on Wednesday. The game will go down as a “no contest” (ESPN).

➔ CONGRESS: Chief executives of Silicon Valley’s most influential tech companies took on partisan complaints at a high-profile hearing on Wednesday, facing concerns that content moderation decisions have become a campaign issue.

At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing purportedly to discuss a federal statute that provides a liability shield for internet companies for content posted on their sites by third parties and lets them make “good faith” efforts to moderate content, GOP lawmakers instead used the opportunity to question company heads about perceived political bias.

As The Hill’s Chris Mills Rodrigo writes, Wicker questioned why Twitter has attached labels to the president’s tweets instead of those by Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As Dorsey noted, unlike Trump, some of Khamenei’s tweets have been removed.

Dorsey also acknowledged that Twitter mishandled a recent New York Post story about Hunter Biden with dubious sourcing. Twitter initially prevented the spread of the article on its platform, sparking particularly harsh criticism from conservatives.

""What I'd tell you is this is a tough fight. It could go either way. We're optimistic we can hold on,"" he said during a Fox News interview when asked how he would handicap the battle for the Senate.

McConnell said there are approximately eight Senate races that he would compare to ""a knife fight in an alley. They are tough challenges.""

""This was always going to be a tough cycle for us,"" he said, adding that there is ""a lot of exposure around the country.""

Republicans are still viewed as favored to win back a Senate seat in Alabama, where Sen. Doug Jones (D) is running for a full six-year term.

Republicans won the majority in 2014 and currently have a 53-47 margin in the Senate. If Democrats win the White House, they would need a net gain of only three seats to control the chamber because the vice president could break a 50-50 tie. They would need a net gain of four seats to have a simple majority outright.

The stops overlap with key presidential battlegrounds, but aides view it as an opportunity to boost senators who were pulled off the campaign trail for stretches of October as they held hearings in Washington, D.C., to push through Barrett's confirmation.

“After making such a sacrifice, Vice President Pence wanted to ensure voters in their states knew how much their respective senators contributed to not only [Barrett's] confirmation, but also the administration's many policy accomplishments,” a senior Pence aide said.

When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Ruth Bader GinsburgThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law Ginsburg's granddaughter cuts election ad for progressive group: 'Make her voice heard at the ballot box' The truth, the whole truth about protecting preexisting conditions MORE died late last month, Republicans viewed the opening of a Supreme Court seat so close to Election Day as a motivating factor for staunch conservatives and base supporters who prioritize judicial appointments.

Experts and strategists have noted that the push to replace Ginsburg has likely been just as motivating for Democrats, who have sounded alarms about Barrett’s potential impact on the Affordable Care Act and who have been incensed by the rush to fill Ginsburg's seat. But they acknowledged the possibility that the Supreme Court fight could make a difference in razor-thin down-ballot races.

“I would say generally speaking that overall the Barrett confirmation has done as much for Democrats as it has done for Republicans,” said David Holian, a political science professor at University of North Carolina-Greensboro.

Holian doubted that Barrett’s confirmation would significantly sway the presidential election or tip a race where one candidate has a lead of 5 percentage points or more in the polls. But in a closer race, such as the Senate contests in North Carolina and Iowa, it could make a difference, he said.

The issue of the judiciary has been further elevated in Senate races given the debate among Democrats over whether to expand the Supreme Court should they take control of the chamber.

President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE typically mentions Barrett's confirmation during his campaign rallies, but his remarks are usually less focused than Pence, who delivers a similar stump speech at each of his stops. Those speeches this week have paid particular attention to candidates who played a role in getting Barrett’s confirmation across the finish line.

Pence has also played up Barrett’s faith in his remarks in an appeal to evangelical voters. While Democrats largely avoided Barrett's religion in her hearings this month, Pence has still turned Sen.

The vice president held two rallies in North Carolina on Tuesday, one in Greensboro and one in Wilmington, and he was joined both times by Tillis. The senator is seeking reelection in a race against Democrat Cal Cunningham, whose campaign has been racked by an admission that he had an extramarital affair.

Tillis, a member of the Judiciary Committee, faced his own setback when he tested positive for COVID-19 after attending a White House event to celebrate Barrett’s nomination. Pence spoke warmly of Tillis on Tuesday, highlighting how they rode together on Air Force Two.

“Having President Trump and Vice President Pence in North Carolina on the heels of a historic Supreme Court confirmation that Sen. Tillis was instrumental in is certainly a boost to our campaign,” said Andrew Romeo, communications director for the Tillis campaign.

“North Carolinians want a senator who will continue to confirm well-qualified judges that don't legislate from the bench and will reject Cal Cunningham and his radical agenda to pack the Supreme Court with liberal activist judges,” he added.

Pence also stopped Tuesday in South Carolina, where Graham is running in a closer than expected race against Jaime Harrison, who has captured the national spotlight with staggering fundraising hauls.

Graham’s allies have been hopeful that his prominent role in Barrett's confirmation proceedings would be a boon to his own fundraising and stabilize his standing before Election Day, and Pence made the senator's role on the Judiciary Committee a key theme of his remarks in Greenville.

The vice president praised Graham's efforts to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch Neil GorsuchThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law Chief Justice Roberts is right on election decisions — except when he's wrong How recent Supreme Court rulings will impact three battleground states MORE and Barrett, but he paid particular attention to the senator's memorable role in the contentious hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughIf it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Vermont secretary of State says Kavanaugh's correction still unsatisfactory Kavanaugh corrects opinion in voting case following Vermont official's objection MORE, where Graham lashed out at Democrats in the middle of testimony about sexual misconduct allegations against the judge.

“You know, I just heard Lindsey say that his opponent’s saying he ran because of the way you handled the Brett Kavanuagh hearing, but I agree with Lindsey,” Pence said. “Lindsey Graham is going to win because of the way he handled the Kavanaugh hearing.”

Pence will be in Des Moines, Iowa, on Thursday, where he's expected to appear alongside Ernst. The Iowa senator is another Judiciary Committee member who finds herself in a close race against Democrat Theresa Greenfield.

“Elections come and go. Political power is never permanent, but the consequences could be cataclysmic if our colleagues across the aisle let partisan passion boil over and scorch the ground rules of our government,” McConnell said, adding that “elections have consequences.”

“We can stand loud and clear that the United States Senate does not bow to intemperate threats. Voting to confirm this nominee should make every single senator proud,” he said.

She argued that any nomination should have been made by the winner of next week’s election.

The move also marks a month of Democratic complaints that the GOP sprint to fill the vacancy was illegitimate, an accusation McConnell rejected. Last week, Senate Democrats boycotted the Senate Judiciary Committee’s vote to advance Barrett’s nomination, handing her a unanimous vote out of the panel as part of her fast track to the Senate floor

At the time, McConnell said that Democrats would regret the move “a lot sooner than you think,” with Schumer changing a couple of words aimed at the GOP.

“My colleagues may regret this for a lot longer than they think,” Schumer said (The Hill).

Monday’s vote served as the final major pre-election plank in the Senate GOP agenda this year. The majority confirmed Barrett and approved $500 billion in coronavirus relief last week. Senate Democrats opposed both.

Vice President Pence had been prepared on Monday to come off the campaign trail to preside in the Senate, but Republicans and the White House decided he was not needed (The Hill). Although members of his senior staff were diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, Pence tested negative once again on Monday. The vice president will campaign today in North Carolina and South Carolina.

The Hill: Trump ripped Biden during his scramble to capture Pennsylvania votes on Monday with his trademark rallies. “We win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” he said. The Keystone State has 20 electoral votes.

The Associated Press: Trump drew thousands of largely mask-less supporters on Monday as he began a final charge through nearly a dozen states ahead of the election. “It’s a choice between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown,” the president claimed at a rally in Allentown, Pa., focusing on the economy and the possibility of lost jobs.

Reuters: Biden appeared near Philadelphia in the city of Chester, Pa., on Monday, meeting with about a dozen campaign volunteers and speaking with reporters. Biden said he was “not overconfident about anything” and that “with the grace of God” he would win Pennsylvania, the state where he was born. “I think we’re going to win Michigan. I think we’re going to win Wisconsin. I think we’re going to win Minnesota. I think we have a fighting chance in Ohio. I think we have a fighting chance in North Carolina. We have a fighting chance in Georgia,” Biden added.

Democrats and Biden’s team are eager to paint Georgia blue (an ambition the party has held for years), according to The Washington Post and The Associated Press.

Niall Stanage: The Memo: Florida and Pennsylvania hold keys to victory.

The Hill: Biden said he will campaign in multiple swing states this week, and he defended the pace of his schedule, which Trump frequently mocks.

LEADING THE DAY





MORE POLITICS & CONGRESS: White House chief of staff Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsSunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day Biden and Trump closing arguments diverge sharply on COVID-19 Democrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' MORE is in the spotlight with gaffes and missteps at a tough political time for Trump, according to The Hill’s Scott Wong and Mike Lillis. On Monday, Meadows, the former North Carolina congressman, repeated his view that COVID-19 will eventually be stopped as a result of treatments and vaccines, not administration efforts to control transmissions, which made headlines over the weekend.

“We're going to defeat the virus; we're not going to control it,” Meadows told reporters outside the White House. “We will try to contain it as best we can, but ... we need to make sure that we have therapeutics and vaccines” (The Hill).

The Washington Post: Meadows is under fire as Trump’s chief of staff for his handling of pandemic and other crises.

Messaging about the coronavirus pandemic by Trump, Pence and Meadows this week stirred confusion and uncertainty about the trajectory of COVID-19 and federal guidance to combat it, reports The Hill’s Brett Samuels. In the final weeks of the campaign, the White House has decided to press on with little regard for the ongoing public health crisis that has killed more than 220,000 Americans. Pence has kept up his campaign schedule, with stops today in North Carolina and South Carolina, and the president has told supporters at rallies that the country is ""rounding the turn"" even as the U.S. sets records for infections reported in a single day.

“Today, we are waiting for an important response on several concerns, including on action to crush the virus. Ten days after Secretary Mnuchin went on CNBC to declare that he was accepting our testing plan, the Administration still refuses to do so,” Pelosi wrote.

Pelosi’s comments come after weeks of negotiations between her and Mnuchin on a nearly $2 trillion package, which would likely include another round of stimulus checks to individuals, renewed enhanced unemployment insurance, tax credits and funds for the airline industry, in addition to a testing plan. As The Hill’s Cristina Marcos notes, House Democrats have called for $75 billion for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing as part of their relief proposal.

CORONAVIRUS: The United States has now established its third peak of daily new cases of COVID-19, with no signs of letting up. Local hospital systems are under stress, the average number of new daily cases of the coronavirus is at a record high and the seven-day average is up more than 22 percent compared with a week ago. The country is in trouble in communities where the weather remains hot and where the autumn chill has arrived (CNBC).

> Curfews: As observed in European countries with high rates of transmission, communities in the United States are opting for new restrictions short of ordering total economic lockdowns. For example, El Paso, Texas, and Newark, N.J., have imposed night time curfews. El Paso residents are urged to stay home after 10 p.m. until before dawn for two weeks as a record spike in coronavirus cases overwhelms hospitals, prompting the state to dedicate part of the city’s civic center as a makeshift care center and officials to describe a “crisis stage” (The Associated Press). Newark, which is New Jersey’s largest city, announced an 8 p.m. daily closing time for all nonessential businesses beginning today. One part of the city had a seven-day average rate of 25.3 percent positive coronavirus tests (The New York Times). … Meanwhile, some Italians in Milan and Turin on Monday broke windows and started trash can fires to protest the curfews there.

Barrett’s nomination marks a new record for how close to the presidential election the Senate has confirmed a Supreme Court nominee. She’ll also be the first justice in modern history to be confirmed without bipartisan support, underscoring Democratic frustration with the GOP push to confirm her and misgivings about her judicial philosophy.

Despite the high stakes of her nomination fight, there was little doubt that Republicans would fill the seat. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.) vowed within hours of Ginsburg's death to give whomever Trump nominated a vote, and GOP senators quickly coalesced behind the strategy.

McConnell, speaking to Republicans on the Senate floor, touted Barrett’s nomination as a long-lasting legacy of the past four years.

“We made an important contribution to the future of this country. A lot of what we’ve done over the last four years will be undone sooner or later. ... They won’t be able to do much about this for a long time to come,” he said.

In many ways, Barrett’s confirmation caps off a generations-long goal for Republicans of a top-down overhaul of the federal judiciary.

Barrett will lock in a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, but beyond that, Trump has appointed a total of 220 judges, including 53 to the influential circuit courts and 162 district court judges. That puts him behind only former President Carter for the most judges confirmed at this point in his White House tenure.

McConnell, who is facing his own reelection bid, gave two thumbs up as he left the Senate chamber after the vote.

Democrats dialed down the temperature for Barrett’s nomination fight, compared with Kavanaugh’s, and stayed away from Barrett’s Catholicism after a controversial hearing for her 7th Circuit nomination in 2017.

Instead, they’ve warned that Barrett, if she’s confirmed, would have negative consequences for health care and reproductive rights, including reining in Roe v. Wade and striking down the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Court watchers believe the Supreme Court could hear an abortion-related case this term if it decides to take up a review of Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban, which was struck down by a federal court. The Supreme Court is also expected to hear a case the week after the election that could determine the fate of ObamaCare.

Mazie Hirono Mazie Keiko HironoOvernight Defense: Dems want hearing on DOD role on coronavirus vaccine | US and India sign data-sharing pact | American citizen kidnapped in Niger Senate Democrats want hearing on Pentagon vaccine effort FCC reaffirms order rolling back net neutrality regulations MORE (D-Hawaii).

Barrett has been critical of the 2012 ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act, but Republicans are quick to note that she hasn’t ruled on the health care law. She also hinted during her confirmation hearing that she thought the law could survive the individual mandate being struck down — a key issue in the case coming before the court next month.

Barrett sidestepped several questions during her days-long hearing, refusing to weigh in on the looming election and whether she would recuse herself from election-related cases. Trump has said he wanted to fill the seat quickly so that his pick could be on the court to help resolve election-related matters.

“The oath that I have solemnly taken tonight means at its core that I will do my job without any fear or favor, and that I will do so independently of both the political branches and of my own preferences,” she continued.

Democrats, if they are in the majority, will also need to decide what they will do with a series of precedents they upheld in the Obama years, including the blue slip, a piece of paper that has been used to allow home-state senators to block a nominee. Republicans have done away with honoring the blue slip for circuit court judges, while keeping it intact for district court picks.

Well, of course, Article 3 of the Constitution doesn't establish how many members of the Supreme Court there should be,” King said. “I don't want to pack the court. I don't want to change the number. I don't want to have to do that. But if all of this rule-breaking is taking place, what does the majority expect?”

McConnell, during a lengthy speech ahead of Monday’s vote, laid the blame for the escalating judicial wars at the feet of Democrats and urged them not to “scorch the ground rules of our government,"" in an apparent hat tip to the discussion about nixing the legislative filibuster and expanding the court.

“I understand my Democratic friends seem to be terribly persuaded by their version of all of this. All I can tell you is: I was there, I know what happened. And my version is totally accurate,” he said.

Schumer warned that the GOP majority was “lighting its credibility on fire.”

Republicans argue that the political shift from 2016, when a Democrat was in the White House, to 2020, when Republicans control both the presidency and the Senate, is a key distinction that's in line with precedent.

“The Senate is doing the right thing. We’re moving this nomination forward. By tomorrow night, we’ll have a new member of the United States Supreme Court,"" McConnell said earlier Sunday on the Senate floor.

But Republicans will set a new record for how close to a presidential election a Supreme Court nominee is confirmed. Previously the closest a Supreme Court nominee was confirmed was July.

""I agree with Mitch McConnell [who said] on the 13th of February, 2016, 'The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,' "" said Sen.

""He said that eight months before the election. This confirmation if it takes place tomorrow, will be eight days before the election. It doesn't pass the straight face test,"" he added.

Several Democrats warned about the impact a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court could have on health care. Democrats worry that Barrett would vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act as part of a case set to be heard by the court on Nov. 10.

“The career scientists at the FDA set strict standards for safety and efficacy for COVID-19 vaccines,” Alexander said in a press release. “Every day Americans take the word of these scientists’ approval of safety and efficacy when we purchase 3.8 billion prescriptions each year.”

“Undermining the FDA’s gold standard of safety and efficacy by setting up state vaccine review panels could delay approval, discourage Americans from taking the vaccine, and cost lives,” Alexander continued.

The senator added in his statement that he hopes “these Democratic Governors would instead focus their time and resources on planning to distribute the vaccine, and improving testing and contact tracing with the resources Congress has provided, rather than second guessing the efforts of FDA scientists.”

The statement comes after Newsom announced in a press conference Monday that California is planning to review federally approved coronavirus vaccines independently before distributing them to residents.

""The question I often get is 'Are you going to take someone’s word for it?' Of course, we don’t take anyone's 'word for it,'"" Newsom said. ""We will do our own independently reviewed process with our world-class experts.""

Last month, Cuomo announced plans for a similar New York board that would independently review FDA-approved vaccines.

Michigan, West Virginia and Washington, D.C., are also in the early stages of creating independent vaccine boards amid concerns that President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE may be politically interfering with the FDA vaccine approval process as the administration pushes to get a vaccine ready as soon as possible with its Operation Warp Speed.

“The White House did exactly what I had urged,” the senator argued. “They respected those decisions and did not change a word. The governors of New York and California should show the same respect to the FDA career scientists that the White House did.”

This comes as several pharmaceutical companies are conducting late-stage trials for coronavirus candidate vaccines.

On Friday, AstraZeneca announced that the FDA had allowed the company to restart its phase three COVID-19 vaccine trial in the U.S. just days after a volunteer in the company’s Brazil trial died.

Johnson & Johnson also announced on Friday that it is preparing to restart its trial following consultation with the FDA.

The company became the second to pause its trial earlier this month after a person suffered an “unexplained illness,” although it said in a statement that there was ""no evidence that the vaccine caused the event.""

While Trump suggested in Thursday’s presidential debate that a COVID-19 vaccine could be available in a matter of weeks, experts have said one likely will not be available for public use until well into 2021.",2020-10-24 16:18:52-04:00,
Democratic Senate emerges as possible hurdle for progressives,"A Democratic-controlled Senate is looming as a potential roadblock for the party’s base if it wins the majority in November.

Progressives are urging their party to go big if it is in power next year with a trifecta, arguing that four years under President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE and six years of a GOP-controlled Senate have illustrated the need for broad systemic reforms.

But Democrats, if they win, are predicting they will have a slim margin fueled in part by victories in red and purple states that would boost the chamber’s fledgling moderate faction, putting a spotlight on the gap between the ideas being discussed by activists and the likely size and political makeup of the caucus come January.

“I think there is a disconnect to some extent. But my heart is with the progressive side. I want to achieve as much we can. I'm realistic and realize we can't achieve everything,” said Sen. Dick Durbin Richard (Dick) Joseph DurbinSenate battle threatens to spill into overtime Democrats warn GOP will regret Barrett confirmation Democrats brace for nail-biting finish to Senate battle MORE (Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, when asked about the ideas being discussed among progressive activists and where the caucus is likely to be in January.

Sen. Chris Murphy Christopher (Chris) Scott MurphyBitter fight over Barrett fuels calls to nix filibuster, expand court Democrats warn GOP will regret Barrett confirmation Democrats brace for nail-biting finish to Senate battle MORE (D-Conn.), a member of the party’s progressive wing, acknowledged that there would likely be conflicting views within the caucus, even if the party is in the majority next year.

“It’s always hard, especially in a diverse caucus like ours ... to keep everybody on the same page,” Murphy said. “We’re a boisterous caucus with lots of different opinions in the minority, and we’ll be the same way in the majority.”

The likelihood of a fierce public fight next year comes as progressives have largely held their fire against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE, an institutionalist who came up in the centrist wing of the party, uniting behind him as they’ve sought to defeat Trump.

But they are pledging to push hard for their top priorities, including democracy reform and ""Medicare for All,"" if Democrats control both chambers in Congress and Biden wins the White House and are warning that they, and their supporters, are ready to apply pressure after the election.

“There is no excuse for inaction or a failure to deliver by this Senate if we have all three branches of government,” said Charles Chamberlain, the chairman of Democracy for America.

Mary Small, the legislative director of Indivisible, added that the Senate should ""fully wield the power that voters have given them, and that means being pretty bold and ambitious,"" including taking up the House-passed democracy reform package, voting rights and D.C. statehood.

“The caucus will have to struggle. ... There’s wings of the party in the Senate, and there’s going to have to be negotiations and discussions there. This is where the clear role for the outside groups, but also constituents, comes in to try to direct and influence the shape of those negotiations,” Small said.

One of the first battles Senate Democrats will need to work out is if they nix the 60-vote legislative filibuster, with opponents of the procedural tool warning it could scuttle their chances of passing top priorities such as health care, voting rights and even coronavirus relief.

A growing number of Democratic senators have appeared open to nixing the filibuster, though it’s unclear if they’ll have the votes to do so with a small majority. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerDemocrats on edge as Biden-Trump fight nears end Reestablishing American prosperity by investing in the 'Badger Belt' House Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education MORE (D-N.Y.), who will become majority leader if Democrats win the Senate, has vowed that “nothing is off the table” as he tries to keep his caucus united ahead of Nov. 3.

Progressives are keeping a close eye on Schumer, who is up for reelection in 2022.

“I think that the entire movement and the entire country is going to be interested in making sure Chuck Schumer Chuck SchumerDemocrats on edge as Biden-Trump fight nears end Reestablishing American prosperity by investing in the 'Badger Belt' House Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education MORE delivers or that he gets primaried,” Chamberlain added.

But even if Democrats defang the filibuster, it’s far from clear that some of the biggest ideas being discussed in the Democratic Party, including expanding the Supreme Court, ""Medicare for All,"" the Green New Deal and D.C. statehood, would have the 50 votes needed to ultimately pass.

“I can pretty much guarantee that some of what they’re asking for is never going to happen, for a variety of different reasons, especially that for a lot of them the votes aren’t there in the Senate,” said Jim Manley, a top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidMcConnell and Schumer's relationship shredded after court brawl The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Justice Barrett joins court; one week until Election Day GOP Senate confirms Trump Supreme Court pick to succeed Ginsburg MORE (D-Nev.).

“What some of these groups don’t understand is if you eliminate the filibuster, there’s still not going to be the majority votes necessary for some things like the Green New Deal, for instance, because there’s going to be a whole bunch of Democrats who aren’t willing to go down that path. ... It’s a brutal truth,” Manley added.

Complicating the calculations for progressives is that the Senate math could give them little room for error if Democrats find themselves in the majority but with their seats capped in the low 50s.

FiveThirtyEight casts the most likely outcome of the Senate battle as Democrats holding a 51-49 majority, a razor-thin margin that would give little leeway in big policy and political battles that deeply divide the caucus.

That could also, in a filibusterless world, give a lot of sway to just a small number of senators about where the caucus goes even if the party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House.

The caucus has members from red and purple states, including Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.)

And candidates in states such as Arizona and North Carolina, who Democrats need to win in order to regain the majority, are viewed as more moderate.

Manchin, for example, is expected to be the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Asked how he views his role next year, as one of the chamber’s few moderates, Manchin replied, “Everybody needs balance. It’s a balance.”

But Durbin, while appearing hopeful that more moderates could be joining the caucus, acknowledged that it would be a “real challenge” to balance the competing factions.

White House hoping for COVID-19 relief deal 'within weeks': spokeswoman,"White House communications director Alyssa Farah said Tuesday that the White House is hoping to reach an agreement with Democrats on coronavirus relief that can be voted on “within weeks,” indicating such a deal is unlikely until after Election Day.

Farah cited continuing disagreements with Democrats on what she termed “bailouts” to state and local governments and direct funding to American workers.

“We are hoping within weeks. I don’t want to get too ahead of any announcements,” Farah added when pressed on whether a deal would be reached before Nov. 3.

Negotiations between the White House and Democratic leaders have dragged on for months without yielding an agreement on new stimulus for businesses and workers impacted by the coronavirus. White House officials expressed hope last Wednesday that some kind of deal could be reached in 48 hours, but that window came and went with no breakthrough.

Still, Mnuchin and Pelosi have continued to have near-daily conversations, and there has been optimism about the prospect of a deal.

Drew Hammill, a Pelosi aide, tweeted Monday afternoon that the Speaker “remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached before the election” but said Democrats were still waiting on the Trump administration to accept their language on a national plan for COVID-19 testing. Hammill also noted that progress depends on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.) agreeing to a comprehensive bipartisan package.

McConnell, who pushed back on a price tag at or above the White House’s $1.8 trillion offer, has said he would put an agreement to a floor vote but did not commit to doing so before the elections. The GOP leader also reportedly told Senate Republicans that he warned the White House about agreeing to a deal with Pelosi before the elections because it could disrupt Barrett’s confirmation. She was confirmed Monday evening.

Trump, who has pushed for a comprehensive deal despite Republican objections to the price tag, also appeared to diminish expectations for a deal Tuesday morning, tweeting that Pelosi is “only looking to Bail Out badly run Democrat Cities.”

Democrats have sought funding for cash-strapped state and local governments impacted by the pandemic, though Trump has regularly accused Pelosi of seeking to “bail out” jurisdictions whose funds have been mismanaged by Democrats.

“She has little interest in helping out the ‘people,’” Trump tweeted.

If the result is even close, the Lone Star State will be flashing a bright warning sign for the GOP, especially when it comes to the electoral downside of Trump’s approach, including his hard-line rhetoric on immigration.

But if the president coasts home comfortably, it will be a sign that many important parts of the country remain out of reach for Democrats.

Texas is more competitive at the presidential level this year than it has been for a generation, according to opinion polls.

A new poll Thursday, from UMass-Lowell, showed the race effectively tied, with 48 percent of likely voters backing Trump and 47 supporting Biden. The Cook Political Report classifies Texas as a toss-up. Trump had a 2.3-point edge in the RealClearPolitics polling average in the state as of Thursday evening.

Early voting figures from the nation’s second most populous state have been at an all-time high.

More than 8.6 million Texans had voted through Wednesday, according to a tally maintained by the Texas Tribune. The early-voting period continues through Friday, and most experts believe the early-vote total is likely to exceed the total number of people who voted in the 2016 election. Early votes in 2016 amounted to about 6.6 million, and the final tally was just under 9 million.

The result is anyone’s guess.

“It’s going to be tight as bark on a tree,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, a professor of political science at the University of Houston.

The fact that Biden is in serious contention to win the state is startling in itself. The last Democrat to carry Texas in a presidential election was Jimmy Carter Jimmy CarterA wave election?

It’s virtually impossible to see a path to an Electoral College win for the president without the state’s 38 votes. In any event, a Trump loss in the state would likely mean he is having a bad day across the nation and is on course to lose other crucial battlegrounds.

Texas has been shifting politically for years, albeit slowly. Former President George W. Bush rolled up margins in excess of 20 points over his Democratic challengers in 2000 and 2004 — perhaps no surprise given he had been the state’s governor. Former President Obama lost Texas by double-digits in 2008 and 2012, before Clinton narrowed things down to 9 points in 2016.

The shifting ground revealed itself again in 2018, when then-Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) drew huge national attention as he sought to oust incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzIt's time for a universal charitable deduction Twitter changes policy, unlocks New York Post account after standoff The Memo: Texas could deliver political earthquake MORE (R-Texas). Cruz held on, but the margin of victory — 2.6 percentage points — was uncomfortably narrow for the incumbent and his party.

A Biden campaign source contended that Democrats in the state were energized by O’Rourke’s performance — and that Biden is continuing to benefit.

“Even though Beto fell short in the end, what he did was awaken a new kind of electorate into thinking ‘My vote matters,’” this source said. “And that is what is going on this year.”

Many analyses of Texas focus overwhelmingly on the Latino population, which has been growing for years. But experts in the state say it’s important not to ignore other ingredients in a more Democratic-friendly blend, including an influx of new arrivals from other states and a growing, liberal-leaning Asian vote.

“We have added 2 million or so registered voters since the last presidential election,” said Texas Democratic strategist Keir Murray. “Latinos will soon make up a plurality of the state’s population, and we have a large number of college-educated professionals whose politics are simply not as reliably red as Texas used to be.”

Murray stopped short of projecting a Biden victory, saying instead that the state was “quite competitive.” But he asserted that the demographic changes, coupled with the polarizing nature of President Trump, was a potent combination.

“These trends were already happening,” he said. “But the Trump presidency has turbocharged them.”

The Trump campaign is scathing about any suggestion that the president could lose Texas.

ADVERTISEMENT

He has not seen the need to visit the state during the peak of campaign season. A campaign spokeswoman, Samantha Zager, said: “With no ground game and no data, Joe Biden’s campaign is left to fabricate narratives and waste money on states he can’t win, like Texas.”

The Trump campaign buttresses its case by noting the enormous money O’Rourke expended on his losing Senate bid — around $80 million. The president’s backers also recall that there were predictions from some quarters that Clinton could win Texas in 2016.

But not all Republicans sound so bullish. Sen.

One question for the GOP in the state — and nationwide — is whether it is Trump’s policies or his rhetoric and abrasive personality that have put Texas in peril. The question is vital because were Texas to ever become solidly Democratic, nationwide wins for the GOP would become next to impossible.

A Republican strategist in Texas, Brendan Steinhauser, said that the state’s voters had not suddenly abandoned conservative policies en masse.

ADVERTISEMENT

Even Texas swing voters, he said, “want lower taxes, they don’t like massive government spending, they are open to a lot of conservative ideas. But it’s how you talk to people and make people feel.”

Trump, he added, “is losing them on personality and character.”

Right now, the only thing that experts are predicting with confidence is a tight race.

“Very close, very close,” said the University of Houston’s Richard Murray, asked for his assessment of the state of the race in Texas. “I would be surprised if the difference in the end was more than 2 percentage points.”

Dobbs on Friday expressed incredulity that conservatives are backing Graham’s reelection, criticizing him for not using his position as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate allegations made by Trump that the Obama administration improperly investigated his 2016 presidential campaign.

“I don’t know why anyone in the great state of South Carolina would ever vote for Lindsey Graham. It’s just outrageous,” Dobbs said.

Dobbs's salvo comes at a time when Graham is trying to rev up conservative support to win a fourth Senate term.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, a respected handicapper, moved the South Carolina Senate race into the “toss-up” category earlier this month. It was previously rated a “lean Republican” race.

The Senate is scheduled to vote after 1 p.m. Sunday to advance Barrett’s nomination to a final vote.

The Democratic leader criticized Pence on Sunday for not following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for self-quarantining, despite heading the White House coronavirus task force.

“The Vice President is maintaining his campaign schedule and, inexplicably, intends to preside over the Senate chamber tomorrow evening. Their carelessness with the health and safety of their colleagues and Capitol employees mirrors their carelessness with the health and safety of Americans during this crisis,” Schumer wrote in a “Dear Colleague” letter.

Schumer said that “we have seen a number of reports of Republican staff testing positive for COVID-19” over the past couple of days, including “members of a senator’s staff” and members of Pence’s team.

Biden pushes into Trump territory,"The late offensive underscores Biden’s polling strength, with his comfortable leads in core battleground states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin affording him the opportunity to go big across the map.

Biden on Tuesday made campaign stops across Georgia, a state that hasn’t gone for a Democratic presidential nominee since 1992. Georgia is also home to two hotly contested Senate and House races this year.

Beginning in the small, rural town of Warm Springs, Biden laid out his closing message, saying he would mold himself after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and unite the country after what he described as Trump’s divisive leadership.

Biden later hit a get-out-the-vote event in Atlanta, where he’ll need to run up the score to have a chance to win the state.

Later this week, Biden will swing through Iowa, a state Trump carried by 9 points in 2016 but where polls now show tight presidential and Senate races. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden begins two-day campaign sprint in battleground Pennsylvania Trump praises Texas supporters who surrounded Biden-Harris bus FBI investigating Biden bus surrounded by pro-Trump cars: report MORE (D-Calif.), has stops planned in Texas, where a half-dozen House seats are up for grabs.

Flush with cash, the Biden campaign is going on the air with new television ads in Texas, Georgia, Iowa and Ohio, another state that few believed would be in play for Democrats when the 2020 cycle began.

Whether he wins or loses the right-leaning states, Biden’s margins will matter as Democrats seek to flip the Senate and pick up House and statehouse seats in Republican strongholds.

Democrats would also like to repudiate Trump, not just beat him narrowly.

“It’s pretty clear the Biden campaign is in a much stronger position going into this final week,” said Joe Trippi, a veteran of nine Democratic presidential campaigns.

“There is a lot of Democratic angst because people are still haunted by the ghosts of 2016. But Biden’s leads are strong and stable in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and they’re not skimping on the airwaves anywhere, so it makes sense for Biden to be aggressive in this final week. Whether you win these states or not, maybe you help Democrats pick up a statehouse or a House seat or a Senate seat somewhere by visiting these places.”

There are some risks.

Biden does not need to win Texas, Georgia, Ohio or Iowa, as Trump does.

While the overall polling is abysmal for Trump, wins in Pennsylvania and Florida would help him piece together the unlikely combination of states he needs for an Electoral College victory.

Biden’s campaign will have a lot to answer for if it spends the final hours before Election Day reaching for a blowout but fails to seal the deal in the core battlegrounds that he must win to have a chance.

“I invite Joe Biden to expend his limited campaign travel on states he’s not going to win in 2020,” Trump campaign manager Bill StepienBill StepienBiden pushes into Trump territory The Memo: Florida and Pennsylvania hold keys to victory Biden's polling lead over Trump looks more comfortable than Clinton's MORE told reporters on a conference call this week.

Biden told reporters he’s “not overconfident about anything.”

“Fortunately, we’re able to compete in a way we haven’t been able to compete before in all of these states,” Biden said, referring to his fundraising advantange.

Georgia looks like a pure toss-up at the moment, although many analysts say Democrats need to first prove they can win statewide before pushing it into the perennial swing state column.

A new CBS News-YouGov survey released this week found Trump and Biden tied. A WSBTV-Landmark poll put Trump ahead by 4 points, and an Atlanta Journal-Constitution survey put Biden ahead by 1 point.

Trump suffers in Georgia from the same phenomena that is dogging him everywhere: Moderates and independents are flocking to Biden, and the Democratic nominee is seen as the better candidate to manage the coronavirus pandemic.

Trump’s management of the coronavirus will be a key part of Biden’s closing message.

“Think about all those who have died,” Biden said Tuesday in Warm Springs. “They were giving their all while their president was giving up.”

Of Biden’s offensive plays, Texas is the heaviest lift. Trump leads by 3 points in the RealClearPolitics average.

But after a new string of jarring numbers, some Republicans are beginning to fear that voters hesitant to say they will back Trump are not coming home and that the few remaining undecided voters are breaking decidedly against him — and the Republican Party as a whole.

“The conventional wisdom among Republican strategists and pollsters was that a natural tightening tends to occur post-Labor Day,” said Ken Spain, a longtime Republican strategist. “The events over the course of the last few days have thrown that into chaos.”

In just the last two weeks, Trump has suffered a steady drumbeat of bad news: The New York Times reported he paid just $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the White House and during his first year as president.

The number of Americans who have died from the coronavirus topped 200,000.

Trump has refused to say he would peacefully cede power in the event he loses the election.

In the midst of it all, Trump blew his opportunity to change the trajectory of the presidential contest with a bombastic, haranguing performance on the debate stage with Biden in which Trump declined to denounce white supremacy.

In what has been a remarkably stable political environment, polling is beginning to show substantial movement away from the GOP.

A poll conducted for CNN, released on Tuesday, showed Biden leading Trump by a 57 percent to 41 percent margin. An NBC-Wall Street Journal survey released over the weekend showed Biden ahead by 14 points. Even Rasmussen, the Republican-leaning pollster that Trump so often touts, found Biden ahead by 8 in their most recent survey.

Virtually every battleground poll is breaking against Trump as well. Recent surveys put Biden well ahead in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire. Trump leads by small margins in usually solidly Republican states like Texas, Missouri and South Carolina. Internal Republican polls show Trump only narrowly leading in states like Montana and Kansas.

“These last three weeks have just felt terrible,” said Jai Chabria, a Republican strategist in Ohio. “It feels like the Democrats have momentum going into this last month, certainly, but I don’t think anyone knows what that means.”

Most Republicans pointed to Trump’s debate performance as the final straw in many voters’ minds. While his core supporters may have loved Trump’s fiery attacks on Biden and his family, those who were anxious or undecided about backing Trump decidedly did not.

“People don’t want him in their living room for four more years,” said one prominent Republican strategist, who ask for anonymity to candidly assess Trump’s standing. “They just are tired of him.”

There are growing signs that Trump’s dismal polling is beginning to impact down-ballot Republican contests. Voters increasingly see little difference between national party figures and their local elected officials.

"Democrats, GOP fighting over largest House battlefield in a decade","GLENDALE, Ariz. — Democrats and Republicans battling for control of the House are bombarding television sets across the nation with hundreds of millions of dollars in paid advertising in the closing weeks before Election Day, across what strategists say is the broadest playing field in a decade.

The four most prominent groups paying for advertising in House races are targeting 31 seats held by Democratic incumbents and 30 seats held by Republicans, according to the nonpartisan firm Advertising Analytics. Those seats stretch from the Alaskan tundra to the beaches of South Florida, from Orange County to rural Maine and seemingly everywhere in between.

“The Democrats wiped us out in areas that have been trending against us but are still friendly terrain for Republicans. They’re defending 31 seats that President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE won in 2016. That’s a big battlefield,” said Rob Simms, a former executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee.

The advertising onslaught is being funded by wealthy donors and small-dollar givers alike, who have funneled an unprecedented amount of money into campaign coffers and outside groups.

Just this week, the four largest of those groups — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the allied House Majority PAC, and the National Republican Congressional Committee and its ally the Congressional Leadership Fund — will spend $66 million on television spots.

“We started the cycle with over 30 seats that Democrats represent that Trump won in 2016, and I think that a lot of folks assumed that is where all the action would be,” said Abby Horrell, who heads the House Majority PAC. “Republicans are playing in a lot of seats that they did not think that they were going to have to worry about defending. I think they find themselves in a much more difficult position.”

Democrats have spent $3.7 million defending Rep. Tom O’Halleran (D), who represents a sprawling district that reaches from the Four Corners to the Phoenix suburbs. Republicans have dropped $1 million on behalf of their candidate, attorney Tiffany Shedd, in a district Trump narrowly carried in 2016.

If the scope of the battlefield is broader than any since 2010, the scale of the spending is larger than any cycle ever. The two parties have committed a combined $10 million or more to television ads in 10 races. Democrats have blocked off more than $5 million in airtime in each of a dozen seats, and Republicans have reserved more than that in nine seats.

The heart of the battlefield remains suburban districts that Democrats won in the 2018 midterm elections, or where Republicans narrowly held on.

But veterans of previous election contests say the amount of money available, to both candidates and outside groups, is funding ad blitzes in districts that have long been tantalizing but where competitive races have not materialized for one reason or another — districts like King’s and Rep.

“Money is the biggest factor. If you have money — the committees and candidates — you can go places you wouldn’t otherwise think about,” Simms said.

Candidates for Congress raised a whopping $433 million in the third quarter of the year, a review of Federal Election Commission filings shows. Since the beginning of 2019, those candidates have combined to raise $1.3 billion. The two party committees have raised almost $450 million between them, and the two super PACs have added about $225 million more.

During the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, there was a shortage in blood donations due to social distancing measures and shelter in place orders. At the time, the FDA reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused ""unprecedented challenges"" to the national blood supply.

Therefore, a revised guidance was published in early April recommending a three-month deferral for gay men to donate blood. The April guidelines were to remain throughout the pandemic.

Demmings, in the announcement said that a blood donation could be ""the difference between life and death,"" noting that the current policy is based on ""fear, stigma, and prejudice, not science.""

""Expanding the donor pool by hundreds of thousands of healthy Americans would save lives every day in emergency rooms and hospitals around the country,"" she said.

Quigley, who said he was proud to take the lead on the issue, said that though Congress had made significant headway to allow men who have sex with men to give blood, it still was not enough.

""Over the course of many years, we have made significant progress in rolling back an indefinite ban on blood donations from MSM, to a 12 month deferral to the current 3 month deferral. This is still not enough. Our work will not be complete until FDA approves a non-discriminatory, science-based policy that properly addresses individual risk assessment, as we’ve seen countries across the world adopt,"" Quigley said.

During the 1980s, gay men were the first known demographic to experience an outbreak of AIDS — a condition caused by HIV. The AIDS epidemic that followed prompted a ban of gay men from giving blood.

The news comes as prominent TV show host Andy Cohen, a gay man, was unable to give plasma during the beginning of the pandemic. At the time, Cohen said the FDA's policy on HIV prevention through blood or blood products was ""discriminatory,"" and that he was HIV negative.",2020-09-04 15:34:04-04:00,
On The Trail: The fallacy of a conclusive election night,"President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s hostility toward mail-in voting in the midst of a global pandemic and a new Supreme Court decision blocking extended ballot deadlines in a battleground state have elections officials worried that two branches of government are undermining confidence in an election Trump is poised to lose.

Trump has increasingly demanded on Twitter that results be known on election night, a ploy apparently designed to exclude millions of people who vote by mail and whose ballots may not be counted immediately even if they arrive long before the polls close.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled that Wisconsin could only count absentee ballots that arrive by Election Day, spurning a Democratic request to extend the deadline.

Elections experts caution that counting millions of ballots, especially in a year in which turnout is projected to set a modern record, takes time. Established rules are in place to ensure a count that favors accuracy over speed, and recent history shows those rules take time.

“We’d rather get it right than fast,” California Secretary of State Alex Padilla (D) told The Hill in an interview Tuesday. “We shouldn’t confuse election night with results night.”

What’s more, some polling places are likely to remain open even after midnight, especially in underserved and minority communities where reducing the number of vote centers — a favored trick of those who hope to disenfranchise voters — has led to longer lines. Every state allows polling places to stay open to accommodate anyone who has joined the line by the posted poll closing time.

“Mail ballots are being blamed for some sort of delay, but what people are completely forgetting is that polling place results cannot come in until polling places are closed,” said Amber McReynolds, chief executive of the National Vote At Home Institute.

The concept of a conclusive result emerging on election night itself is an entirely modern construct, one that has occurred only a few times in recent years.

Trump’s own victory four years ago wasn’t assured until 2 1/2 hours after midnight, when The Associated Press concluded he would become the nation’s 45th president. Sen.

Bush in 2004.

Bush had to wait even longer in 2000. He only knew he would be president on Dec. 12, 36 days after Election Day, when the Supreme Court ruled a recount in Florida should not continue.

Only in blowout elections have media outlets like The Associated Press been able to call races over on election night itself.

Ronald Reagan knew he would be president, and then that he would win reelection, before 9 p.m. in both 1980 and 1984, two contests in which he routed his Democratic opponents. Media outlets later agreed to wait to call races until polls closed in West Coast states, which meant Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaA wave election?

What’s more, even when the outcome is certain, no election becomes final until state elections officials — not the media companies with which Trump has so often feuded — certify results. No elected official takes office, no elector casts their ballot for president, because The Associated Press gives them permission.

“The simple fact that NBC calls it doesn’t mean the ballots are all counted,” said Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice’s Democracy Program. “The counting is never done on election night. There are always provisional ballots, there are always military and overseas ballots.”

In a state like California, the formal certification process can take a month. Counties have 30 days to finish processing ballots, and Padilla’s office conducts a post-count audit.

And California has a reputation for well-run elections. New York this summer took more than a month to certify primary election results that showed Rep.

This year, states are dealing with a deluge of early and absentee votes, driven by the coronavirus pandemic and the record-high enthusiasm among both Democrats and Republicans. All those votes take hours, sometimes days, to count; many states bar elections administrators from even beginning to count mail-in ballots until the polls have closed, even if those ballots were received weeks before Election Day.

Elections experts were alarmed, then, when Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughIf it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Vermont secretary of State says Kavanaugh's correction still unsatisfactory Kavanaugh corrects opinion in voting case following Vermont official's objection MORE seemed to dismiss votes that are not immediately counted on election night. Writing in concurrence with the conservative majority’s decision to block extra time for Wisconsin ballots, Kavanaugh seemed to conflate early results with final results.

“States want to avoid the chaos and suspicions of impropriety that can ensue if thousands of absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election,” Kavanaugh wrote, even though many states allow ballots postmarked on Election Day to be counted if they arrive after polls have closed.

“Those States also want to be able to definitively announce the results of the election on election night, or as soon as possible thereafter,” he wrote, even though no state definitively announces results of an election on election night.

Kavanaugh is one of three members of the Supreme Court, along with Chief Justice John Roberts and newly minted Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett Amy Coney BarrettThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law If it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Pittsburgh newspaper backs Trump in first GOP presidential endorsement since 1972 MORE, who worked on Bush’s legal team in Florida during the 2000 recount — when they asked courts to accept military ballots that had come in after Election Day.

“If we don’t have Supreme Court justices who are accurately citing election laws in states, we’re in for a pretty tough time,” McReynolds said.

To elections experts and administrators, the demand for immediate results is a fig leaf covering a deep insecurity about a full and complete count.

“Anybody who’s demanding final results on election night is clearly trying to spin the results, and possibly results that they may not like. Anybody who knows anything about elections knows it takes a little bit of time to get the count right,” Padilla said. “Those seeking to undermine confidence in our elections, including but not limited to foreign adversaries, would love nothing better than chaos and conspiracy theories on Nov. 3 and 4.”

As unhinged as the conspiracy is, it has gained steam in conservative circles and several Republicans running for the House this year have backed the theory, including Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is expected to win her general election race this November.

Greene has been praised effusively by Trump and backed by Republican leadership despite her supportive comments about QAnon and a history of racist and anti-Semitic comments.

""QAnon and other conspiracy theories and movements that dehumanize people or political groups, incite violence or violent threats and destroy faith and trust in our democratic institutions must be identified, condemned and exposed through facts,” Riggleman told The Hill.

“The First Amendment is a powerful weapon. Turning that weapon on those who use fantasies as a menacing grift is the responsibility of reasonable citizens, legislators and executives.”

The QAnon theory is considered a serious threat, and has been tied to multiple instances of criminal activity.

Besides Greene, several other House GOP candidates have also expressed openness to the QAnon theory, including Lauren Boebert in Colorado, Burgess Owens in Utah, Mike Cargile and Erin Cruz in California, and Illinois's Theresa Raborn.

The Freedom Caucus-affiliated House Freedom Fund, for example, has endorsed and directed funding toward Greene, Boebert and Owens.

Greene and Boebert have both attempted to distance themselves from the theory since winning their primaries. Experts studying QAnon have said while those walk-backs are expected, they'll do little to convince the theory’s adherents that the candidates aren’t on their side.

While most Republicans have clearly condemned the theory, they have also sought to distract from it by pointing to allegations of violence by left-wing activists.

An amendment offered by Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) to include language in the measure condemning violence committed by antifa was voted down in the House Rules Committee.

Antifa, short for anti-fascist, refers to a loose collection of primarily leftist activists. The movement has been a preferred target of Trump as the source of violence and property destruction at anti-police brutality protests despite no evidence linking the two.

FBI Director Christopher Wray in a hearing earlier this month pointed out that the term refers to an ideology, not an organization. QAnon, on the other hand, has been directly linked to violence.

The resolution adopted Thursday cites numerous examples of violence and criminal activity seen from QAnon supporters and calls for federal law enforcement and the FBI to allocate more resources toward countering conspiracy-driven extremism.

The FBI has labeled the conspiracy theory a potential domestic terrorism threat, and it has been linked to kidnapping, terrorism and murder.

The news of Kemp’s exposure comes as Georgia, which was hit hard in the first coronavirus wave, finds itself in the middle of a new rise in cases.

Kemp faced criticism early on for his aggressive reopening plan, including even from President Trump, though Trump has now emerged as a chief cheerleader of reopening businesses despite spikes in cases nationwide.

The U.S. on Thursday hit a record for a single-day increase in coronavirus infections with nearly 90,000 new cases, an alarming spike before the cold winter months, when cases are expected to increase even further.

McConnell has been adamant about the Senate returning this week, despite pushback from fellow senators. The House, which was also supposed to return the Capitol this week, pushed back its return date after consulting with Capitol physician Brian Monahan.

Monahan told Republican aides on Thursday that he didn't have enough COVID-19 tests to test every lawmakers slated to return and that he didn't have access to the 15-minute tests that are used by the White House. He said that he will only test lawmakers who have exhibited symptoms connected to the virus: cough, fever, difficulty breathing, runny nose and fatigue. Asymptomatic lawmakers will not be tested.

Most polls show Trump lagging with women behind Democratic nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE, particularly in suburban areas — a voting bloc largely responsible for the so-called blue wave that helped Democrats regain control of the House in 2018.

A survey in September found suburban women cited Trump's mishandling of the coronavirus as a key reason they plan to vote against him in this year's presidential contest.

The Trump campaign is betting that a law and order messaging blitz will help the president's popularity among women in purple districts such as Oakland and Kent counties.

During a rally last month, Trump joked about his lagging poll numbers with women, who were among the blocs that helped him win the White House in 2016.

“Suburban women, will you please like me?” Trump said. “I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?”

In August, the Detroit News reported the state had recovered more than half the jobs it lost during the pandemic. By late April, Michigan reported 1.2 million jobless claims since March 15, when the pandemic shut down most of the country, according to Crain's Business Detroit.

Trump makes appeal to suburban women at rally: 'Will you please like me?',"President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE on Tuesday made an appeal to suburban women to support his reelection bid amid polls showing his campaign cratering among that particular group of voters in the final sprint to Election Day.

At a campaign rally in Johnstown, Pa., Trump touted his repeal of an Obama-era regulation meant to expand low-income housing in suburbs in an attempt to quash racial discrimination and his support for law enforcement as reasons suburban voters should flock to his campaign.

“They talk about the suburban women. And somebody said, ‘I don’t know if the suburban woman likes you.’ I said, ‘Why?’” Trump told the crowd, though he did not clarify to whom he had spoken. “They said, ‘They may not like the way you talk,’ but I’m about law and order. I’m about having you safe. I’m about having your suburban communities. I don’t want to build low-income housing next to your house.”

“Suburban women, they should like me more than anybody here tonight because I ended the regulation that destroyed your neighborhood. I ended the regulation that brought crime to the suburbs, and you’re going to live the American dream,” he added. “So can I ask you to do me a favor? Suburban women, will you please like me? I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?”

The plea comes amid GOP hand-wringing that Trump’s flagging poll numbers in the suburbs and in crucial battleground states will doom his reelection campaign.

A Washington Post-ABC poll released in August showed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE winning the suburbs by 8 points and suburban women by 13 points.

Trump has based his attempts to regain ground in the suburbs on his opposition to fair housing regulations and his support for law enforcement amid a national reckoning over systemic racism and police brutality, railing against Black Lives Matter and casting protesters as anarchists and communists.

However, observers note that his remarks about the suburbs typically reflect the neighborhoods as they existed in decades past and not today.

“This is an imaginary suburb that Trump is talking about,” Brookings Institution demographer William Frey told The Hill in August. “Today, the suburbs are just like the rest of America. They’re rich and poor and Black and white and Hispanic.”

In a pivot, Trump noted the diversity of today’s suburbs, suggesting he was trying to help Americans of all stripes, claiming that 29 percent of suburbanites are people of color.

Still, the polls flash a warning sign for Trump in the final three weeks to Election Day. No Republican has won the White House without winning the suburban vote by at least 4 percentage points since 2004.",2020-10-13 21:17:42-04:00,
GOP sees chance to take out Democratic House campaign chief,"Rep. Cheri Bustos Cheryl (Cheri) Lea BustosHouse Democrats run late ads defending vulnerable DCCC chair Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority GOP sees chance to take out Democratic House campaign chief MORE (D-Ill.), the head of House Democrats’ campaign arm, is facing an increasingly competitive reelection bid to represent Illinois’ 17th District.

Bustos, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), represents a congressional district that then-candidate Donald Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE narrowly won in 2016. And while she trounced her GOP competitor in 2018, winning by more than 24 percentage points, Bustos is now facing what may be her most expensive and heated battle yet against GOP candidate Esther Joy King.

The Cook Political Report on Wednesday moved Bustos’ race against King from likely Democrat to a lean Democrat district. And internal GOP polling has also elevated Republican hopes that they can win the seat from the woman leading the House Democrats’ campaign effort.

ADVERTISEMENT

Bustos, in a Zoom call with reporters on Wednesday, projected confidence heading into the final stretch, while also acknowledging that she has always expected tough races with her Trump-leaning district.

“We are well prepared to finish strong and I live the advice that I give to all of our frontliners and red to blue candidates, which is run your race like you’re running for mayor…everything is hyperlocal,” Bustos said in part. “You show up, you listen, you fight for the people at home, and everything you do is for the people you represent.”

Asked why the race was tightening, Bustos said it is a “Trump district” and noted that her campaign has had to figure out ways to campaign in her district’s 14 counties amid the pandemic.

“I show up in all of them. Even during a pandemic, we’ve figured out ways to show up,” Bustos said.

Bustos’ campaign has attacked her GOP opponent for wanting to repeal the Affordable Care Act and for only living in the district for about a year, claiming King filed to run in the election shortly after moving.

“[H]er opponent, who supports the lawsuit that would raise health care costs and take away protections for people with preexisting conditions, just moved to the district from Chicago right before filing to run for Congress,” said Bustos campaign manager Tom Bryant.

“We're confident in our strategy heading into November.”

Some reports have also raised questions about King's claims about starting various social media and media-focused companies, which have little presence online. King, in response, has blasted Bustos for the scrutiny, claiming she is attempting to distract from her record representing the district.

""This is what Washington politicians like Cheri Bustos do when voters have had enough of them - they attack and distort their opponent's record as a distraction from the fact that Bustos is helping create jobs in China, not here Illinois,"" King said.

King’s campaign has also dismissed accusations of being a carpetbagger, noting she moved for military training and opted to remain in the area.

“Esther has been in the district for nearly two years. She came here for Army training at the Rock Island Arsenal, and fell in love with the area, and the people who live here. Esther is involved in the community, and has made this her home,” a King campaign spokesman said in a statement.

King and other GOP critics, meanwhile, are claiming that Bustos is absent from the district, which is helping her campaign gain traction.

“It's a commonly known thing that Miss Bustos is not representing us well,” King told The Hill in an interview on Thursday. “For example, last night I spent some time talking with a group of union guys and they're like, ‘Man, she only comes around when she needs a picture with us.’ So there is this sense that we deserve better representation.”

King, a reserve captain in the U.S. Army’s Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps and former aid worker in Afghanistan, has also credited the tightening of the race to her campaign’s grassroots efforts.

King said that her operation has knocked on more than 100,000 doors since she launched her bid, and despite some pollsters indicating that Trump could have a negative impact on candidates down ballot, she argues the president remains popular in the district.

Rodney Davis Rodney Lee DavisGeorgia Republican Drew Ferguson tests positive for COVID-19 Lawmakers say infrastructure efforts are falling victim to deepening partisan divide The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Trump, Biden blitz battleground states MORE (R), who represents Illinois’s 11th District, says he has been telling colleagues in the Beltway for months that the Illinois 17th District is in play for Republicans this election cycle.

“It just shows you that you can't forget about your home district -- thinking about what your next step is in Washington — because it may be a surprise if you've got to come spend millions to defend yourself against a very good candidate like King,” added Davis, who himself is facing a highly competitive reelection race.

The Cook Political Report shows Davis in a toss-up race, and it moved the Davis race to toss-up this week from lean Republican. It was one of 12 races that Cook shifted this week. Eleven of those races shifted toward Democrats, underscoring how the political winds appear to be moving in their favor. Bustos’s race was the exception, as Cook moved that race toward the GOP.

The Tarrance Group, a GOP polling company, sent King and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) a survey last week that found King was within five points of Bustos, with Bustos at 49 percent, King at 44 percent, and 7 percent undecided.

“The race for the 17th Congressional District of Illinois is close,” a memo the NRCC provided to The Hill stated.

Should King beat Bustos, it would be a significant win for Republicans, particularly as some polling groups are projecting that the House GOP may sink deeper into the minority after the election.

Bustos’ campaign is challenging the GOP narrative that she has lost touch with her district.

“Cheri's focus has always been on listening to the people she serves and delivering real results that matter to them — that's why she's continued to earn their support,” Bryant said in a statement to The Hill.

Bustos’ campaign has already spent more than $1.5 million on the race, while King has spent about half that, at roughly $810,000, according to Federal Election Commission filings.

“I feel good going into Nov. 3.” Bustos said on the Wednesday call.

"Hoyer lays out ambitious Democratic agenda for 2021, with health care at top","House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton HoyerDemocrats seek wave to bolster House majority Hoyer lays out ambitious Democratic agenda for 2021, with health care at top Top Democrats introduce resolution calling for mask mandate, testing program in Senate MORE (D-Md.) on Tuesday outlined a broad and ambitious legislative agenda for 2021, predicting Democrats will have unified power to move the party's priorities on issues as varied as health care, infrastructure, climate change and gun reform.

""I think we're going to deal with all of those — and more,"" he said on a call with reporters.

First on tap, Hoyer said, would be another round of emergency coronavirus relief, which has stalled this month amid partisan differences over the size and scope of the next aid package.

ADVERTISEMENT

Hoyer, echoing comments from President Trump just hours earlier, said he's hopeful the sides can unite in the post-election session to adopt another massive stimulus bill.

""It may not be as much as we want, but [a] comprehensive bill,"" he said.

Yet Hoyer also suggested the coronavirus relief effort will spill into the next Congress, noting that no vaccine is expected before then. Democrats have pressed for assurances that distribution of the vaccine, if and when it arrives, will be free and equitable, without disadvantaging lower-income families and minorities.

""The president's right: the only way we're going to solve this ultimately is the vaccine,"" he said. ""The problem is the president said it was going to happen months ago or weeks ago or whatever, and deluded the American people.""

Hoyer, who is expected to return as House majority leader next year, said Democrats will also elevate efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, an issue of particular urgency to party leaders because the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Nov. 10 — just a week after Election Day — in a suit seeking the law's full repeal.

""Obviously, Coney Barrett's going to be hearing that case,"" he said. ""Obviously they rushed her through for that reason.""

Hoyer also ticked off a host of other issues Democrats plan to tackle next Congress, pointing as a template to the scores of bills Democrats passed over the last two years under Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided? Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.).

That extensive list includes efforts to adopt massive infrastructure spending, reform police practices, tackle climate change with a shift to green energy, expand background checks on gun purchases and revamp the campaign finance system, including the elimination of dark money. Virtually all of those proposals were disregarded, after House passage, by the Republican-controlled Senate.

""Much of what bills we passed I think we'll look at them again,"" Hoyer said. ""Because again, it's not as if they were defeated in the Senate, they were just ignored in the Senate.""

Even if Democrats win both chambers of Congress, they would not have free rein to move their legislative wish list given the filibuster power of the minority party in the Senate. But Democrats are banking that the popularity of their various agenda items — most of which enjoy broad public support — would force the hand of Senate Republicans in the next Congress.

""If some of the issues we passed they felt were unpopular, they'd be going after those,"" Hoyer said. ""They're not going after the Affordable Care Act anymore, as they did in 2016 and 2018.""

A week before Nov. 3, Hoyer's remarks represent both a legislative forecast and an eleventh hour campaign pitch to voters of all stripes, who are highly energized and already heading to the polls by the millions around the country.

With Trump trailing badly in the polls, Hoyer voiced confidence that Democrats would pick up numerous seats in the House — he put the net gain near 15 — flip control of the Senate and secure the White House with a Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE victory.

""I think it's pretty well cooked,"" Hoyer said.

The House is scheduled to return to Washington on Nov. 16, with lawmakers facing not only pressure to move more coronavirus relief, but also a Dec. 11 deadline to fund the federal government and prevent a shutdown.

Hoyer said he's already advising members to be flexible beyond Dec. 11, in the event that negotiators need more time to secure a deal on the spending bill.

The two Democrats introduced a resolution Wednesday that would call for the enforcement of social distancing requirements either in the Senate office buildings or the Senate-side of the Capitol and a contact-tracing program.

“Senate Republicans must join us here in reality and acknowledge that through their inaction, they are creating a truly dangerous situation,"" Schumer said in a statement.

Klobuchar added that the resolution includes ""common sense measures our government must have in place to protect the Senate community, including our staff, and to fully function during this pandemic.""

The resolution would throw Senate support behind the chamber following public health guidelines and call the lack of a ""coordinated and comprehensive COVID–19 strategy in the Senate ... a threat to the legislative branch.""

The two Democratic senators are also calling for a ban on a person going to the Senate floor or to a committee after a positive coronavirus test and until a person tests negative, and that any person who has either had the coronavirus or has been exposed to it get two negative tests on separate days before returning to the Capitol. Neither of those details are specifically included in the resolution.

The resolution comes after three GOP senators tested positive for the coronavirus and another three are quarantining due to exposure to their colleagues.

House GOP campaign arm touts fundraising figures in tight races,"The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is touting new fundraising numbers in its effort to flip several swing districts in November, pointing to GOP challengers who raised more than Democratic incumbents during the third quarter, according to an internal memo shared with The Hill.

Political forecasters have painted a grim picture for the House GOP come November, with some projecting the party could lose between five and 15 seats. The prospects for Republican gains were dealt another blow by so-called Democratic front liners largely outraising GOP challengers in the past quarter.

But Republicans are hopeful that 16 of members of its Young Guns program are better positioned than they were earlier after edging out their opponents in terms of fundraising during the third quarter of 2020.

Some of the GOP candidates mentioned in the memo include Young Kim, who narrowly lost her race against Rep. Gil Cisneros Gilbert (Gil) Ray CisnerosMORE (D-Calif.) in 2018. Kim brought in $1.8 million to his $872,000 and has a cash on hand advantage of $542,635, according to the NRCC.

“These candidates are having powerful fundraising quarters and everyone ought to be taking them seriously down the home stretch,"" NRCC spokesperson Chris Pack said in a statement.

On Thursday, the House Democratic campaign arm announced it had raised $70 million during the third quarter and entered September with $35 million more cash on hand than the NRCC. The NRCC has not yet publicly released its September fundraising.

“Democrats have outworked, outhustled, and outraised Republicans all cycle long,"" said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Robyn Patterson in a statement. ""Our candidates will keep using the resource advantage they have built over the last 22 months to push deep into Republican territory and hold Republicans responsible for trying to rip away Americans’ health coverage during a deadly pandemic.”

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which has outraised the House GOP campaign arm by more than $57 million this cycle, is up with new ads in districts that Trump won by 10 points or more in 2016 in Arizona, Minnesota, Montana, Michigan, Missouri and Colorado.

All told, the DCCC is on the airwaves in 11 of the 18 “red to blue” districts they’ve targeted where Trump won by double-digits in 2016.

The DCCC says least 32 of the 38 candidates in their “red to blue” program outraised their GOP rivals in the third quarter — some by huge margins. In a shocking development, the DCCC has slightly more cash on hand than the Trump campaign.

It’s not all offense for House Democrats, who are defending more than 30 seats in districts Trump won in 2016. That includes Rep.

“We’ve built a strategy positioning us to win deep into Trump Country,” Bustos said.

Trump won Montana by 20 points. He won Hagedorn’s district by 15 points, and he carried the Schweikert and Amash districts by 10 points each.

The Cook Political Report has the Arizona, Montana and Michigan districts rated as toss-ups, with the Minnesota district still leaning Republican.

The DCCC is hitting Schweikert over ethics violations pertaining to his campaign spending — one of its few attack ads that does not focus on health care.

Schweikert won reelection by 24 points in 2016 but his margin was reduced to only 10 points in 2018, as suburban Phoenix voters began to gravitate away from the GOP.

“We are competing with and outperforming Republicans … primarily in suburban districts,” said DCCC executive director Lucinda Guinn. “Suburban America, women in suburban America, the growing diversification in suburban America, they are fleeing the Republican Party.”

A recent poll found Trump leading Biden by only 1 point in Arizona’s 6th Congressional District, with Schweikert ahead by 3 points over his Democratic challenger, Hiral Tipirneni. However, Tipirneni outraised Schweikert by almost $2 million in the third quarter alone.

The DCCC ads in the red districts in Minnesota, Montana and Michigan attack the GOP candidates on issues pertaining to health care, which Bustos says will be the primary focus of the party’s closing message.

In Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District, Democratic nominee Dan Feehan outraised Hagedorn in the third quarter by more than $1.3 million. In Montana’s at-large district, Democrat Kathleen Williams outraised Republican Matt Rosendale by about $1 million this quarter.

A DCCC-sponsored poll from over the summer in Indiana’s 5th Congressional District found Democrat Christina Hale leading by 5 points over Republican Victoria Spartz. The same poll found Biden ahead by 13 points in the Indianapolis-area district.

Some Republicans are dismissive of Democratic investments in the districts Trump carried easily.

“These are of course seats Republicans want to protect but we always knew Democrats would challenge us for open seats and in districts with a lot of suburban voters, this isn’t new,” said one GOP strategist who works with House campaigns.

And the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) pointed to instances in which Democrats are on defense.

Democrats running in rural areas, such as longtime Rep. Collin Peterson Collin Clark PetersonTrump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Democrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority MORE (Minn.), face tough battles as the rural-urban cultural divide deepens.

When asked about the DCCC investments in districts Trump won easily in 2016, NRCC spokesman Chris Pack responded: “Does that include Cheri Bustos’s own district where her opponent Esther Joy King is nearly within the margin of error?”

Trump narrowly carried Bustos’s downstate Illinois district in 2016 after it went for former President Obama in 2012. Bustos has won her past two elections by more than 20 points but Republicans have high hopes for Esther Joy King, the 34-year-old member of the U.S. Army JAG Corps who is challenging Bustos. The DCCC is not spending in the race.

“I’m one of 30 Democrats serving in a district Trump won,” Bustos said. “I go into every single race I have knowing it’s a tough district and this election cycle is no different. We’re well prepared to finish strong.”

The DCCC says its polling indicates Trump has shed 5 to 10 points of support in many of the districts he won in 2016 because of his handling of health care and the coronavirus pandemic.

“I’d certainly rather be a Democrat running for Congress right now than a Republican,” said Bustos.

“The fact that we are well positioned as we go into Nov. 3 in these districts Donald Trump won by 10 or more points just one presidential cycle ago is pretty remarkable,” she added.

Republicans acknowledge the bleak polling data but are hopeful Democrats are reading too much into surveys suggesting Trump will lose big.

“It’s something Republicans have to be aware of because the suburbs are a tough place right now if you’re a Republican, no matter where you are on the ballot,” said the GOP strategist. “If that bleeds into rural or exurban areas that could have additional effects, but I’d throw cold water on the idea that Democrats are moving into Trump Country.”",2020-10-22 06:00:20-04:00,

The first-term congressman is up against Wendy Davis, a former state senator, in what has become one of the most hotly contested House races on the map. But it’s Trump who is the dominant figure in the campaign — as has been the case for much of the past four years — in the ethnically diverse and politically evolving 21st Congressional District.

Roy believes it is both a blessing and curse for his prospects.

ADVERTISEMENT

""He is mobilizing the hell out of a core group of supporters throughout the district, and he's mobilizing the hell out of a core group of opponents, and what that means is you've got a lot of intensity on both sides of that debate,"" Roy told The Hill in an interview. ""We're trying to figure out how to grow and build that coalition around that intensity, and then figure out how these last two weeks go with respect to those who haven't decided.""

""This district is very reflective of the national situation. Why? We're highly suburban in two parts of it. We're urban, suburban and rural,"" Roy added. ""We're all of it in a significant way.""

Texas's 21st Congressional District stretches from downtown Austin, through the city's suburbs, to the rural Hill Country, all the way down to north San Antonio, with the fight over undecided voters centered on the latter portion of the district.

According to an internal poll, conducted on Oct. 11 and 12 by the Club for Growth, Roy leads by 5 points over Davis, 47-42, with 8 percent undecided.

But most expect whoever wins to do so narrowly.

""She's got so much money. Her ads are on my TV more than the car wreck trial lawyers. Back-to-back,” said one Austin GOP political operative. “He has a narrow path. He's just gotta put the right coalition together, but I don't know.”

Notably, Roy is outpacing the president, who, despite winning the district by 10 points in 2016, is running even there against former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE, according to the poll. Despite the contest being viewed on both sides as being about base turnout, the Texas conservative has been forced to seek out elusive Biden-Roy voters, who he says are those who have “grown a little tired of all the noise in D.C. and just can’t” vote for the president.

""What it's coming down to is a choice on what metric to use in making your decision,” said David McIntosh, head of the Club for Growth, laying out the question in the mind of voters. “Do I do it on personality? Or do I do it on the agenda?”

While Roy is known as one of the most conservative members in the House GOP conference, he does not fall in line with his party all the time. The former chief of staff for Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzIt's time for a universal charitable deduction Twitter changes policy, unlocks New York Post account after standoff The Memo: Texas could deliver political earthquake MORE (R-Texas) received scorn from both sides of the aisle and within Texas for single-handedly temporarily blocking a $19.1 billion disaster aid package for damage caused by Hurricane Harvey in May 2019, though he is unapologetic to this day for doing so (“I’ll do that every day, twice again on Sunday,” he says).

Unlike many House Republicans, Roy also isn’t a knee-jerk defender of Trump, and is more than willing to point out where he disagrees with the president, including on the message currently being sold. Namely, he wishes Trump’s campaign would focus on the actions of the administration rather than continue to rattle on about Hunter Biden, the Democratic nominee’s son.

ADVERTISEMENT

""If I were advising the campaign ... I would say your closing argument needs to be a closing argument about what this administration's done for the country, and nothing more. Focus on that like a laser,"" Roy said, noting that he’s had “strong conversations” with Trump world about this recently. ""Own it. Get out there and fight. Gollee.”

While Roy and Davis are both viewed as being on the political extremes in their respective parties, the two candidates have pitched themselves to voters as bipartisan bridge-builders who can get stuff done for the district, all the while casting their opponent as extremists.

Both sides are spending big to get the message across. Davis is the best-funded House challenger this cycle, having posted a haul $3.4 million in the third quarter and raised $8 million this cycle, and is backed up by the House Majority PAC and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which have spent $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. As for Roy, he raised a respectable $1.6 million in the third quarter, with the Club for Growth providing backup in both the Austin and San Antonio media markets to the tune of $6 million.

For months, Democrats have pummeled Roy over health care and for not taking the pandemic seriously enough as he held in-person events dating back to May. While Roy disputes the attacks, his campaign played into them last week as he hosted a veterans event at an outdoor pavilion in Bulverde on Wednesday where more than 100 attendees rarely adhered to social distancing and very few wore masks. At the conclusion of the event, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry Rick PerryThe Memo: Texas could deliver political earthquake The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Trump, Biden blitz battleground states Texas Republicans sound post-2020 alarm bells MORE (R), who was the final speaker at the event, called for all of the veterans present, including some who had served in World War II, to pack in near the stage.

“There’s a lot of you in here. Come on up,” Perry said as they moved toward the stage. “I like it when there’s not enough room.”

Davis, who spoke to The Hill over Zoom last week, only recently resumed in-person campaigning.

“I also take very seriously that we in roles like the one I’m in and Chip Roy is in, we have an opportunity to model good behavior, and I’m proud of how my campaign has conducted itself in that regard,” Davis said.

Democrats have grown bullish over their chances to flip the district, especially as early voting has shown a massive turnout since it kicked off on Oct. 13. As of Tuesday, 7.8 million Texans statewide — 46 percent of the state’s registered voters — have voted, with the numbers in the district equally as eye-popping. Over the weekend, Hays County, roughly half of which resides in the 21st congressional district, became one of the first counties across the U.S. to eclipse its total turnout in 2016. And in Travis County, home to Austin, total turnout stands at 52 percent.

The anniversary of sorts underscores the historic level of dysfunction and discord between two of the most powerful people in Washington.

Almost every occasion where Pelosi and Trump have crossed paths since Democrats won the House majority in 2018 has shown how much they can’t stand each other, let alone attempt to strike any legislative deals together like other past presidents and Speakers of opposing parties.

Their last extended conversation, during a sit-down meeting at the White House on Oct. 16, 2019, resulted in the two sides unable to agree on whether Trump called Pelosi a ""third rate"" or ""third grade"" politician and her telling reporters afterward that “we have to pray for his health.”

Their relations have only worsened since then.

We're seeing the evidence of that right now.”

Pelosi has said that it's difficult to negotiate with someone as unpredictable as Trump, who in the last 10 days alone has changed positions at least three times on a long-stalled coronavirus relief package that at times even put him at odds with Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Trump abruptly called off the bipartisan talks early last week, only to hours later call on Congress to pass standalone measures like stimulus checks and aid for the airline industry. And on Thursday, Trump said that he’d be willing to go higher than his administration’s current $1.8 trillion offer.

“I don't speak to the president. I speak to his representative,” Pelosi told CNN earlier this week.

""Quite frankly, my experience with the president has been that it hasn't been on the level. You know, he'll say something and then it doesn't really happen. So in the interest of time, we'll work with who he sends over,"" she said on MSNBC last month.

It’s not unusual for presidents and congressional leaders of different parties to clash publicly or delegate aides and Cabinet officials to hammer out specific details of legislation. But they typically have been at least on speaking terms and at times even had warm personal relationships behind the scenes.

Pelosi herself has managed to work with a Republican president before. During her previous stint as Speaker, Pelosi collaborated with former President George W. Bush and members of his administration on issues like bailing out the financial industry during the 2008 crisis despite her party’s fierce opposition to the Iraq War and Bush’s Social Security reform plan.

Pelosi has since expressed nostalgia for his presidency compared to Trump, in stark contrast to when she called Bush a “total failure” in 2008.

Pelosi and Trump’s interactions, meanwhile, have often ended in disaster.

They were last in the same room together in early February at the National Prayer Breakfast, where Trump said he doesn’t like people “who say ‘I pray for you’ when they know that’s not so” as Pelosi sat five seats away.

That came two days after Trump appeared to snub Pelosi’s attempt at a handshake at his State of the Union address and she ripped up a copy of his speech before the cameras afterward.

Trump and Pelosi’s last extended conversation a year ago was focused on Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria. It ultimately devolved into Trump telling Pelosi that “I hate ISIS more than you do,” while she told him that “all roads with you lead to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.”

That wasn’t the first meeting where one of them left abruptly. In May 2019, Trump walked out of a meeting with Pelosi and other Democratic leaders on infrastructure legislation because she had accused him earlier in the day of engaging in a “cover-up.” It marked a sharp turn of events from less than a month earlier, when Trump and Democrats emerged from a meeting at the White House agreeing to pursue a $2 trillion infrastructure package.

And in December 2018, during a televised Oval Office meeting about funding the government, Trump tried to taunt Pelosi — who was locking down votes in her caucus for Speaker at the time — by saying that “Nancy’s in a situation where it’s not easy for her to talk right now.”

“Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory,"" Pelosi shot back.

Despite the lack of progress on any legislation after those heated encounters, the political combat offered both Pelosi and Trump opportunities to score points with their respective bases.

After their meeting a year ago, Trump tweeted out a photo of Pelosi standing up with her finger pointed at him, captioning it as “Nervous Nancy’s unhinged meltdown!”

Pelosi responded by making it her header photo on social media, and the image of the Speaker standing at a table surrounded almost exclusively by seated men quickly went viral. And after ripping up Trump’s State of the Union address in February, Pelosi received a standing ovation during a closed-door House Democratic Caucus meeting.

Since then, Pelosi called Trump “morbidly obese” while criticizing his decision to take an unproven coronavirus treatment in May and has repeatedly suggested that White House advisers and family members should stage an “intervention.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Trump, who often refers to her as “Crazy Nancy,” responded by calling Pelosi a “waste of time” and a “sick woman” with “a lot of mental problems.”

Pelosi has been able to score some bipartisan deals with the Trump administration, like previous coronavirus relief measures, a budget agreement, funding the government and a new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, even while House Democrats were moving to impeach the president last year.

But those agreements were primarily brokered between Pelosi and Mnuchin, not Trump.

“Especially when you're in a leadership position, you should have the ability to set aside those political differences and recognize we have a job to do. And that means we need to talk to each other, we need to know each other, and we need to respect and trust each other that in our roles we can communicate firsthand, face to face,” Reed said.

“But then also you don't have miscommunications and you do not have staff or third parties translating critical exchanges of information that only can be delivered accurately face to face.”",2020-10-16 06:00:09-04:00,

LEADING THE DAY:

New polling data released on Wednesday finds presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE widening his lead over President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE.



The surveys show Biden ahead by landslide margins and are certain to set off alarms among Republicans, who could lose both the White House and the Senate if the president’s numbers don’t improve.



A new national poll from Quinnipiac University found Biden ahead by 15 points, 52 percent to 37 percent. That’s a 7 point jump over the same poll from last month.



The survey found Trump’s approval job approval rating falling by 6 points to 36 percent, against 60 percent who disapprove.

“Yes, there’s still 16 weeks until Election Day, but this is a very unpleasant real time look at what the future could be for President Trump. There is no upside, no silver lining, no encouraging trend hidden somewhere in this survey for the president,” said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy.

A Monmouth University survey found Biden leading Trump by 13 points in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump carried the state by less than 1 point in 2016 and it is a key piece to his reelection strategy.

Republican Rep. Mike Kelly George (Mike) Joseph KellyGeorgia Republican Drew Ferguson tests positive for COVID-19 Working together to effectively address patient identification during COVID-19 Michigan Republican isolating after positive coronavirus test MORE (Pa.) said this week that polls in Pennsylvania can’t be trusted because they don’t take into account Trump’s support from those who turned out to vote for the first time ever in 2016.

ADVERTISEMENT

Kelly argued that “likely voter” models used by many pollsters are not sampling those first-time voters.

But Trump actually does better in Monmouth’s “likely voter” model than he does when Monmouth tested all registered voters in the state.

When Monmouth considered a high-turnout election of likely voters in Pennsylvania, Biden leads by 10 points. When Monmouth considered a low-turnout election of likely voters, Biden’s lead narrows to 7 points.

“Even taking into account any polling error from four years ago, Biden is clearly doing well in swing areas. The Democrat has roots in this region which may be helping him, but there seems to be an overall erosion of support for Trump compared to 2016,” said Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray.

A CNBC-Change Research survey found Trump’s job approval rating hit a record low of 45 percent among likely voters in the six core battleground states of Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.

And a new analysis from the pro-Biden super PAC Priorities USA found Biden ahead in all six battleground states. If the election were held today, Priorities USA projects that Biden would win 278 Electoral College votes, compared with 143 for Trump, with 56 leaning toward Biden and 61 leaning toward Trump.

FROM CONGRESS AND THE STATES:

And in Alabama, Tommy Tuberville, the Trump-backed former Auburn University football coach, vanquished Jeff Sessions, who had been trying to win back his old Senate seat.

Colin Allred (D-Texas) in 2018, won a GOP primary runoff in the state’s 17th District on Tuesday as he tries to get back to Washington.

One race that remains unresolved is the Republican runoff in Texas’s 23rd District, where Tony Gonzales, who’s backed by Trump, and Raul Reyes, who’s endorsed by Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzIt's time for a universal charitable deduction Twitter changes policy, unlocks New York Post account after standoff The Memo: Texas could deliver political earthquake MORE (R-Texas), remain separated by only seven votes. There are still some mail-in ballots and provisional ballots that need to be counted, but the ultra-close margin has left the race undecided for the time being.

MONEY WATCH:

One month after she lost in the Democratic primary for Georgia’s 7th District, Nabilah Islam is launching a new PAC with the hope of providing support to other progressive contenders.



ADVERTISEMENT

The group, known as the Progressive List, launched on Wednesday and will help get money to candidates in the early stages of their primary campaigns. Islam says the group will also give candidates the proper tools and resources to fundraise and reach out to voters.



“This is something that didn’t really exist when I was a candidate,” Islam told The Hill. “It would have been really helpful had an organization really listed my candidacy earlier on rather than waiting until the last month or two.”



“We’re going to be certainly targeting transformational candidates, progressives [who] we believe that look like their districts, are working class, running on progressive policies, but being on the ground with them day one,” she continued. “Making sure they have a check list--do you have a good campaign manager? Do you have progressive consultants that are good? Set the stage for them so that they have the tools to be successful.”



Meanwhile, the former Republicans running the Lincoln Project say they raised $16.8 million in the second quarter of 2020 as the group ramps up its anti-Trump efforts ahead of the general election. Tal reports.

President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE on Tuesday used a steamy Rose Garden event to assail former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE as his political opposite on everything from China trade to illegal immigration and from taxes to energy.

Rambling on and off a teleprompter, Trump riffed for an hour in front of journalists sweltering in the 90-degree heat. He glanced at his notes, skewered policies Biden supports and scanned the famous expanse of green where summer insects buzzed around his face.

“We could go on for days,” Trump said during a lengthy pitch for reelection during an event billed as a White House news conference (he fielded three questions). “There's probably never been a time when candidates are so different,” he added (The Hill).

The Washington Post: Trump uses Rose Garden event for campaign-like attack on Biden.

Early on Tuesday, Biden, who leads Trump in key polls and whose campaign has been outraising the incumbent, rolled out the second part of his economic plan: a $2 trillion proposal to combat climate change that includes a goal to set a 100 percent clean energy standard by 2035.

According to The Hill’s Jonathan Easley, Biden’s approach seeks to correct racial economic disparities. Speaking from a gym in Wilmington, Del., the former VP argued that communities of color have been especially victimized by corporate polluters, saying they have taken on “environmental and health burdens but shared none of the profits.”

The New York Times: Biden announces $2 trillion climate plan.

The president will visit Georgia today, venturing to a 2020 battleground state where he has a narrow edge over Biden, according to the RealClearPolitics average.

Biden is ahead in a number of states Trump carried four years ago and holds a 9-point lead nationally, according to the latest RCP average. But the president dismissed a question about whether he’s an “underdog,” arguing his campaign’s internal polls show him in fine shape to win. He predicted a “silent majority” of voters would give him a second term and reject Biden and his policies as too liberal.

“We won a race where it was the same thing: 2016,” Trump said, recalling the naysayers who were surprised when narrow margins in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan helped him win the Electoral College while Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE captured the popular vote. “I think that the enthusiasm now is greater, and maybe far greater, than it was in 2016” the president added.

Adding to the president’s issues are decisions by states to institute a second wave of shutdowns in response to the spread of COVID-19. As Niall Stanage writes in his latest memo, shutdowns in California, Texas and Florida will have a significant economic impact, which could prove to be politically crushing for Trump as he banks on an economic rebound in the fall to propel him to reelection. The White House encouraged the president’s trade adviser to attack in an Op-Ed the expertise of the president’s leading infectious disease adviser, a sign the president is rattled by his slide with voters during the pandemic.

The New York Times: U.S. and China drift toward a cold war. Trump said on Tuesday he has not spoken recently with President Xi Jinping and has “no plans” to do so.

South China Morning Post: Trump signs Hong Kong Autonomy Act and ends the city’s preferential trade status. China, in reaction, vows retaliatory sanctions (Reuters).

The Associated Press: Trump signs bill, order rebuking China, and slams Biden.

The Hill: Trump, U.S. officials praise United Kingdom ban on China’s Huawei after pressure campaign.

Fox News: Trump vows to sign a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive order, which he called a “big merit-based immigration action.”

The Hill: Trump stirs controversy with race remarks defending “white people” during media interviews on Tuesday.







A MESSAGE FROM ARGENTUM











LEADING THE DAY





CORONAVIRUS & CONGRESS: Regions around the country continued on Tuesday to struggle with rising COVID-19 caseloads and concerns about surges in patient hospitalizations. In Florida, for example, the state hit a one-day record in deaths (The Hill). In Arizona, officials reported 4,273 confirmed coronavirus cases on Tuesday and an all-time high in hospitalizations (The Associated Press).

To slow the spread of COVID-19, officials in Philadelphia are expected to announce that large public events will not be permitted through the end of February (The Philadelphia Inquirer). … Hawaii extended its quarantine order until Sept. 1 (USA Today). … New York added to its list another four states from which visitors must self-isolate for two weeks. It removed Delaware, bringing the total to 22 states (The Hill).

Oklahoma and Nevada are reporting record numbers of new coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths, according to data tracked by The Washington Post.

During a time in which reliable data are essential for researchers and clinicians, the White House on Tuesday began to move the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is part of the Health and Human Services Department, out of the loop as the recipient of COVID-19 case information. Instead, the administration wants governors to deploy the National Guard to enter hospitals to collect disease information (The Washington Post).

Perhaps the most upbeat development on Tuesday were some favorable preliminary results from at least one vaccine clinical trial (The Associated Press). Anthony Fauci Anthony FauciSenior adviser points to vaccine when pressed on Trump's comments about 'rounding the corner' on pandemic Davis: 5 questions for Trump voters Fauci rips White House coronavirus approach MORE, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said there was “good news” to reveal this week. The experimental vaccine, developed by Fauci’s colleagues at the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., will start its most important step around July 27: a 30,000-person study to prove if the shots really are strong enough to protect against the coronavirus. Trump on Tuesday said, “We’re doing very well on the vaccines … many of which are looking really good.”

> Young people: Smoking and vaping render teens and young adults more vulnerable to the coronavirus, according to a new University of California study (New York Post) .

> Testing takes too long: A dramatic slowdown in testing turnaround times is undermining the U.S. response to the coronavirus. Quest Diagnostics, one of the major companies processing tests for COVID-19, said Monday that its average turnaround time for results is now at least seven days. That means by the time people receive test information, it is too late to quickly alert their contacts if results are positive (The Hill).

> Masks: The United States could control the spread of COVID-19 in one or two months if everyone would wear a mask, said CDC Director Robert Redfield (CNBC). He said he believes Trump and Vice President Pence should wear face coverings in public to set examples. Pence has donned masks regularly at recent events, while the president has done so once, last Saturday (The Hill).

> Congress & next stimulus measure: Lawmakers are laying down markers as they prepare for negotiations on another massive coronavirus relief package ahead of Congress’s return next week.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.) said on Monday that he is having ongoing discussions with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinDemocrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Trump, Biden set for weekend swing state sprint Mnuchin says he learned of Pelosi's letter to him about stimulus talks 'in the press' MORE on the next package and predicted that the Senate GOP conference will be brought into the mix next week (The Hill).

According to CNN, the GOP proposal is expected to include $1.3 trillion in relief, with McConnell again reiterating that liability protection for businesses, schools and hospitals will be included in any proposal, calling it a “must” for any final bill. The proposed liability period would last from December 2019 until December 2024.

“It must have, must, no bill will pass the Senate without, liability protection for everyone related to the coronavirus,” McConnell said. “Nobody should have to face an epidemic of lawsuits on the heels of the pandemic that we already have related to the coronavirus.”

The Hill: GOP coronavirus proposal takes shape.

In response, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerDemocrats on edge as Biden-Trump fight nears end Reestablishing American prosperity by investing in the 'Badger Belt' House Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education MORE (D-N.Y.) said that Senate Democrats will take part in negotiations only if House Democrats have a seat at the table (Politico).

Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.) indicated on Tuesday that she is prepared to delay the House’s planned August recess if additional time is needed to reach a deal on the next phase of legislative action regarding COVID-19.

“We absolutely have to. We also have to come to an agreement. The timetable is the timetable of the American people,” Pelosi told CNN. After they return to work on Monday, lawmakers will have three weeks to put a bill on the president’s desk before they are scheduled to leave for the month-long August recess (The Hill).

Bloomberg News: McConnell says GOP will pitch its own stimulus plan next week.

The Associated Press: Trump team eyes school funds boost in next virus aid bill.

The Hill: Joseph Dunford withdraws from consideration to chair coronavirus oversight panel.

> Protests: House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) said Tuesday that protesters should be more diligent when choosing which historical monuments to challenge. He defended the records of George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant, two historical leaders whose monuments have been targeted by racial justice protests.

However, the No. 3 House Democrat railed against other historical figures, including John C. Calhoun, arguing that they do not deserve ""a place of honor"" among American heroes.

Clyburn made the comments in an interview with The Hill’s Rafael Bernal, the first installment of “Reflections,” a series of digital interviews being conducted by The Hill on systemic racism and implicit bias in the United States.







IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES





CAMPAIGNS & POLITICS: Former Attorney General (AG) Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsGOP former US attorneys back Biden, say Trump 'threat to rule of law' Biden fact checks Trump on 545 families separated at border, calls policy 'criminal' Harris walks fine line on Barrett as election nears MORE lost his bid for a second life in the Senate on Tuesday night, falling in the Alabama GOP primary runoff to Tommy Tuberville after the president’s repeated body blows crippled his chances of winning the nomination.

Sessions faced a steep uphill climb to win back the Senate seat he occupied for two decades after his recusal from Russia investigation, which he continued to stand behind on Tuesday night while addressing supporters.

“I followed the law,’’ Sessions said. “And I saved the president’s bacon in the process.’’

With 100 percent of the vote counted, Tuberville won 60.7 percent to just 39.3 percent for the former AG. The loss also marked the unceremonious end of a political career only four years after it hit its apex with Trump’s 2016 victory when Sessions became the first lawmaker to support his campaign, turning into one of his most influential backers.

Shortly after the race was called, Trump danced on Sessions’s political grave in a celebratory tweet, noting that Tuberville “WON big.”

The result also left Tuberville, a political neophyte, to take on Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) in November. Jones is the most vulnerable Senate Democrat up for reelection this fall (The Hill).

The New York Times: Sessions pays the price for incurring Trump’s wrath, losing Alabama Senate race.

The Hill: Sessions defends recusal: “I leave elected office with my integrity intact.”

The Alabama contest was the most noteworthy result on Tuesday night, which also featured contests in Texas and Maine. In the Senate Democratic runoff in the Lone Star State, M.J. Hegar locked down the party’s nod to take on Sen.

As of early this morning, the two were separated by only seven votes after more than 24,000 ballots were counted.

The Hill: Mark Kelly raises $12.8 million for Senate bid against Sen. Martha McSally Martha Elizabeth McSallyMore veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress Senate candidates focus closing arguments on health care, experience Senate battle threatens to spill into overtime MORE (R-Ariz.).

> Convention: Republicans should plan to pack more lightweight togs in preparation for the party’s national convention in Jacksonville, Fla., next month, as most of the event will take place outdoors.

The New York Times reported Tuesday that Republicans are planning to move three nights of the quadrennial confab from an indoor arena to outdoor stadiums, including the final night, when the president is slated to accept the Republican nomination.

The Associated Press: Rep. Steve Watkins Steven (Steve) Charles WatkinsEthics panel opens probe into Rep.

THE CLOSER





And finally … he just felt lucky.

A man in suburban Detroit was given the wrong lottery ticket. But there was no mistake about the result: a $2 million winner.

The Michigan Lottery on Tuesday said a 57-year-old man stopped at a gas station in Eastpointe, Mich., to put air in a tire. He needed change for the air machine and also asked for a $10 Lucky 7′s scratch-off ticket.

“The clerk handed me the $20 ticket by mistake. He offered to exchange it for me but something told me to keep it. I am sure glad I did!” the man said in a statement released by the Lottery.

The name of the winner wasn’t released. He opted to take a lump sum of about $1.3 million instead of $2 million spread over years, the Lottery said (The Associated Press).

Trump federal salary adviser resigns over order stripping worker protections,"A top appointee to the panel that advises the government on employee compensation resigned Monday over a recent order from President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE that would strip some federal workers of their employment protections.

Ronald Sanders, a Republican who has served under administrations of both parties, said he could not continue as chair of the Federal Salary Council when the president’s new order “seeks to make loyalty to him the litmus test for many thousands of career civil servants.”

Trump's order, issued Wednesday, is being criticized by unions as the biggest change to federal workforce protections in a century, converting many federal workers to “at will” employment.

ADVERTISEMENT

The order targets policy-oriented positions, creating a new class of employment that makes it easier to fire employees for performance reasons without the opportunity to contest the decision or rely on union representation.

It also makes it easier to hire new employees outside of the competitive process — something critics say could be used to hire policy employees without appropriate experience.

Trump argued in his order that it will give agencies “the flexibility to expeditiously remove poorly performing employees from these positions without facing extensive delays or litigation.”

But Sanders joined others in arguing that it could be used to push out employees not seen as friendly to the administration. The council he leads advises the White House, and its members are appointed by the president.

“It is clear that its stated purpose notwithstanding, the executive order is nothing more than a smokescreen for what is clearly an attempt to require the political loyalty of those who advise the president, or failing that, to enable their removal with little if any due process,” Sanders wrote.

“I simply cannot be part of an administration that seeks to do so … to replace apolitical expertise with political obeisance. Career federal employees are legally and duty-bound to be nonpartisan; they take an oath to preserve and protect our Constitution and the rule of law … not to be loyal to a particular president or administration.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The order gives agencies 90 days to determine which employees would be moved into the new Schedule F category, a timeline that could coincide with a change in administration.

Unions representing federal workers, such as the American Federation of Government Employees, have argued the order could have broad implications affecting public health, the environment and defense.

""Coming at this time, the dangers posed by the directive are particularly alarming. We rely on the judgement of civil service experts to lead responses against the pandemic, inform the public, drive research, update guidance and review data supporting the use and distribution of vaccines and treatments to address the impacts of COVID-19,"" the Infectious Diseases Society of America wrote in a statement.

""Replacing our scientists and public health experts with politically motivated staff will reduce our ability to respond, and reduce public confidence in our response, to COVID-19 and other public health crises.""

Some Democratic lawmakers have said they will be working on legislation to reverse the order.

“It is particularly noteworthy that President Trump introduced this measure as he publicly feuds with medical and scientific experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci Anthony FauciSenior adviser points to vaccine when pressed on Trump's comments about 'rounding the corner' on pandemic Davis: 5 questions for Trump voters Fauci rips White House coronavirus approach MORE. Trump seeks to blame others for his incompetent failures on the pandemic at every turn, and this order shows the lengths to which those around him are willing to go to appease his Nixonian sense of paranoia,” Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), who represents the largest number of federal workers of any member of the House, wrote in a statement the day the order was signed.

Sanders said his resignation was designed to show that federal workers should not fear speaking truth to power.

“To some, requiring that loyalty may seem entirely appropriate. After all, shouldn’t all employees do what the boss and his lieutenants tell them to do?” Sanders wrote. “I say no, at least not when it comes to career civil servants. The only ‘boss’ that they serve is the public, and the laws that their elected representatives enact.”

""Peaceful transfer? I absolutely want that. But ideally, I don’t want to transfer, because I want to win,"" Trump said during an NBC News town hall.

But he then went on the attack, accusing Democrats of failing to participate in a peaceful transfer when they ""spied heavily on my campaign"" and ""tried to take down a duly elected sitting president."" The Obama administration did investigate members of Trump's campaign team over concerns about potential ties to Russia.

ADVERTISEMENT

""And then they talk about, 'Will you accept a peaceful transfer?' "" Trump said. ""The answer is yes, I will. But I want it to be an honest election. And so does everybody else.""

Trump had previously refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, drawing rebukes from Republicans.

The president has for months railed against mail-in ballots, which are becoming increasingly preferred during the pandemic, suggesting the election will be ""rigged"" or ""fraudulent"" because of them.

Trump repeated some of those claims on Thursday, citing a vague case where ""thousands of ballots [were] dumped in a garbage can"" and referencing a case in Ohio where roughly 50,000 voters received inaccurate absentee ballots.

Experts have repeatedly said there is no evidence of meaningful voter fraud involving mail-in ballots, and Trump's own FBI director has said there is no evidence of a ""coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election whether it’s by mail or otherwise.""

Trump's repeated attacks on the integrity of the election have raised alarms among lawmakers and watchdogs. He escalated his rhetoric last month when asked if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power.

“We’re going to have to see what happens, you know, but I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots. The ballots are a disaster,” Trump told reporters at a White House briefing.",2020-10-15 20:48:54-04:00,
McCarthy faces pushback from anxious Republicans over interview comments,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthySunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day House Democrats run late ads defending vulnerable DCCC chair The truth, the whole truth about protecting preexisting conditions MORE (R-Calif.) is facing pushback after claiming in a recent interview that he is likely to keep his job as the top Republican in the House even if the GOP conference loses seats in November.

Multiple Republican lawmakers, pointing to poll projections that Democrats could gain between five and 15 seats in November, say it’s possible a viable challenger emerges for the top role.

They expressed frustration over an interview McCarthy gave Politico in which he said he would not be at fault should the GOP fall further into the minority. Critics accused him of having misplaced priorities for talking about leadership races when he should be solely focusing on the fight to take back the House.

“Everybody is in the middle of the race for their lives, and he's worried about gathering votes to be minority leader,” a Republican lawmaker said of whipping leadership votes in the weeks leading up to the election. “I think that's telling.”



Rep. Chip RoyCharles (Chip) Eugene RoyDemocrats seek wave to bolster House majority Texas Republicans sound post-2020 alarm bells The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Smart or senseless for Biden to spend time in Georgia, Iowa? MORE (R-Texas), who is in a neck-and-neck race against Democrat Wendy Davis for Texas’s 21st Congressional District, suggested the interview was tone-deaf, particularly for those facing competitive races back home.



""All Republicans should be focused on nothing more than making sure we win every race,” Roy said in an interview with The Hill. “When I'm reelected, we're going to wake up on the 4th, and I'm going to be demanding some conversations about where the party's heading, and then we can talk about who and how.""

Others argued that McCarthy’s closeness to President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE may be a liability to moderates in swing districts Trump lost in 2016. They say the minority leader hasn’t provided enough cover to break party lines to survive in their districts.



McCarthy, though, argues that he has delivered on his promises.



“If you think we lose seats, it’s based upon my job as minority leader, I don’t think that’s the case,” McCarthy told Politico. “Let's sit back and say, just like anybody running for office, ‘What did you promise you would do?’ and ‘What did you achieve?’”



Some lawmakers feel differently, and they worry McCarthy may be gearing up to cast the blame on other members of leadership, including National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer Thomas (Tom) Earl EmmerMcCarthy faces pushback from anxious Republicans over interview comments 3 congressmen on Air Force One with Trump took commercial flight after president's diagnosis House Democrats' campaign arm reserves .6M in ads in competitive districts MORE (R-Minn.) in the event of a sweeping loss.



“Leadership is earned. It’s not given. And I think it's critical that we at least gain seats in this upcoming election in the House, and if we're not able to regain the majority, we at least need to gain seats,” another senior GOP lawmaker told The Hill. “If leadership does not accomplish that, we need to reconsider that.”



But multiple Republican lawmakers also came to McCarthy’s defense, dismissing the criticism as misguided. They said the California Republican has done a strong job as minority leader, particularly with fundraising and campaigning amid unforeseen difficulty. And even if they lose seats, they argue, the blame shouldn’t fall on McCarthy because voters are responding to Trump and the coronavirus pandemic.



“The bottom line is he's exceeded expectations when it comes to fundraising. We have more money to spend on incumbents and candidates than we've ever had to spend, even when we're in the majority,” said Rep. Rodney Davis Rodney Lee DavisGeorgia Republican Drew Ferguson tests positive for COVID-19 Lawmakers say infrastructure efforts are falling victim to deepening partisan divide The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Trump, Biden blitz battleground states MORE (R-Ill.), who is facing a competitive reelection race.



“It is a presidential environment, and he's done the best job he could in the minority, on the political side and the governing side too.”



Sources close to McCarthy noted that he has had widely successful fundraising numbers, racking in $103 million this cycle as well as campaigning across the U.S. for GOP candidates, and will continue those efforts in the days leading up to Nov. 3.



They also noted he has helped lead successful procedural tactics on the House floor, such as the motion to recommit, providing additional fodder for members and candidates looking to attack their opponents’ voting records.



GOP lawmakers said he has been able to unite various factions of the conference from the moderates to the ultraconservatives, which they noted is an impressive feat.



“I think he is widely supported in the conference. He's done a good job bringing the left and the right of the conference together, so I don't foresee him having an issue. ... I think he's done as good a job you can do right now,” said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.).



One clear example of this is Rep. Jim Jordan James (Jim) Daniel JordanHouse Judiciary Republicans mockingly tweet 'Happy Birthday' to Hillary Clinton after Barrett confirmation Sunday shows preview: Trump, Biden gear up for final sprint to Election Day McCarthy faces pushback from anxious Republicans over interview comments MORE (R-Ohio), a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, who challenged McCarthy for minority leader just two years ago. Now, Jordan, who lost to McCarthy in 2018 in a 159-43 vote, is an ally who is pledging not only that he will not run against McCarthy but also that he will support him next year, whether or not they lose seats in November.



“No, he will not challenge the leader,"" spokesman Russell Dye said in a statement to The Hill last week. ""Mr. Jordan thinks Kevin McCarthy is doing a tremendous job for the Conference.”



Still, the Politico interview seemed to touch a nerve for some because they viewed McCarthy’s comments as a white flag in the midst of the battle. Some GOP lawmakers groaned that his comments indicated a sense of unnecessary pessimism about their odds of picking up seats in the final stretch.



“I will say that that's the thing that ticked me off about the whole thing is that he implied that we are going to lose seats,” another lawmaker said. “I don't believe we are going to lose seats. I believe if we keep working hard we're going to take seats.”



The discussion of leadership races led some GOP lawmakers to point to House Minority Whip Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph ScaliseOvernight Health Care: House Dem report blasts Trump coronavirus response | Regeneron halts trial of antibody drug in sickest hospitalized patients | McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 Democrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' House Republicans slated to hold leadership election on Nov. 17 MORE (R-La.) and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney Elizabeth (Liz) Lynn CheneyHouse Republicans slated to hold leadership election on Nov. 17 McCarthy faces pushback from anxious Republicans over interview comments Steve King defends past comments on white supremacy, blasts NYT and GOP leaders in fiery floor speech MORE (R-Wyo.) as possible contenders, though the two have not made any public indications that they are vying for such a position.



Scalise previously weighed a bid for Speaker after former Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanMcCarthy faces pushback from anxious Republicans over interview comments Pelosi and Trump go a full year without speaking Jordan vows to back McCarthy as leader even if House loses more GOP seats MORE (R-Wis.) announced his retirement. But the Louisiana Republican wasn't notified in advance that Ryan would endorse McCarthy, much to the dismay of his allies, and ultimately did not run for the top role.

In the event of Democrats picking up a sizable number of seats in November, multiple GOP lawmakers view Scalise as the likely successor for the position, though both Scalise and McCarthy have closely tied themselves to Trump.



Others said Cheney, who has broken with the president on a number of key issues, could have the opportunity to make a play for the spot in the event that former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE wins in November.



Others said it’s possible both Scalise and Cheney move up, or a dark horse could emerge should the conference decide it needs a new direction at the top following Election Day.



“I believe that the one that is most vulnerable is McCarthy. The second on the list of being vulnerable would be Cheney if they can find a viable candidate to replace her,” one member said, noting tensions between Cheney and the members of the far-right flank of the party in the past.



Nothing will be decided until the results from Election Day are in, but for now, McCarthy may be able to weather any potential storms.



“I think that is one of those things that will be determined after the election,” the member added.

Trump didn't pay income tax for 10 of 15 years before 2016 election: NYT,"President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE paid no income taxes for 10 of the 15 years before he was elected president, and just $750 a year in 2016 and 2017, according to The New York Times, which obtained the president's tax information for the last 20 years.

The Times found that Trump faces hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and struggling Trump Organization properties and that he has taken advantage of a number of write-offs to avoid paying taxes.

In a statement to the Times, Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said that ""most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate"" and reportedly took issue with the amount of taxes the Times reported that Trump has paid.

""Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,"" Garten told the Times.

Trump himself also denied the Times's reporting during a press conference on Sunday, calling the story ""totally fake news.""

""The IRS does not treat me well. They treat me like the Tea Party,"" he continued, referring to claims from GOP figures that the IRS targeted GOP-leaning groups during the Obama administration.

The bombshell Times report revealed that the president faces payments on more than $300 million in loans that will become due in the next few years, while revenue from his time hosting ""The Apprentice"" on NBC has mostly dried up, and he has largely sold his stock portfolio.

Trump reportedly made hundreds of millions of dollars from his work and related licensing on “The Apprentice"" over the years, which was apparently invested back into Trump Organization businesses. But the Times analysis of Trump’s finances finds those businesses have continued to lose millions, resulting in Trump avoiding payments on income taxes while earning millions from “The Apprentice” due to losses at other businesses.

The Times reports that Trump’s tax records show $47.4 million in losses in 2018, despite Trump announcing in a financial disclosure that he made at least $434.9 million.

Other details revealed by the Times include that the Miss Universe pageant was most profitable under Trump and generated $2.3 million for him as a co-owner of the pageant.

Trump Organization tax records also show, according to the Times, that between 2010 and 2018, it wrote off around $26 million in unexplained “consulting fees.” The consulting fees claimed as tax deductions for hotel projects in Vancouver and Hawaii match the payments Ivanka Trump Ivana (Ivanka) Marie TrumpTimes Square billboards featuring Ivanka Trump, Kushner moved to Florida before Election Day Trump officials blur lines on campaigning, governing US forces rescue American citizen held hostage in Nigeria MORE reported, more than $747,600, from a consulting company she co-owned, according to the Times.

Also revealed in Sunday's report was the at least partial scope of Trump's overseas dealings, long a target of government ethics organizations due to concerns that foreign investors could seek to curry favor with the president through his businesses. At least $73 million was made abroad by the Trump Organization during the first half of Trump's term, according to the documents.

The Times reports that while Trump paid just $750 in income taxes in the U.S. in 2017, Trump or his companies paid more taxes in other countries, including $15,598 in Panama, $145,400 in India and $156,824 in the Philippines.

At a press conference Sunday, Trump sought to cast doubt on the reporting and suggested that he would release his returns when he no longer faces federal audit, a claim he has made since the 2016 election.

""It's under audit. They've been under audit for a long time,"" he said Sunday.

“I knew that the institution I was with probably wasn't going to give him a real consequence.

“What was important to me about that moment with Rep. Yoho this this summer was that I wanted to change a norm,” where women are punished for pushing back against men who treat them poorly, she said.

“For some reason, the act of aggression is not the problem. But speaking up about it is.”

In July, a reporter for The Hill overheard an exchange in which Yoho told Ocasio-Cortez she was ""disgusting"" for recently suggesting that poverty and unemployment are driving a spike in crime in New York City during the coronavirus pandemic.

""You are out of your freaking mind,"" Yoho told her.

Ocasio-Cortez shot back, telling Yoho he was being ""rude.""

After Ocasio-Cortez walked away, Yoho called her a “f---ing bitch.”

Ocasio-Cortez would later excoriate Yoho in a widely-viewed floor speech.

“I think it's important that everyone out there understands that you can stand up for yourself and standing up for yourself is not selfish. It's not complaining. And it's not petty,” Ocasio-Cortez told Fonda, calling it a necessary step in breaking a chain of abuse that might otherwise continue.

""Fucking bitch,"" he said.

Ocasio-Cortez, a liberal firebrand and social media sensation, is no stranger to attacks from the right. But shortly after the exchange, she said it was the first time since she arrived in Congress that another lawmaker has challenged her so aggressively.



""That kind of confrontation hasn't ever happened to me — ever,"" she said. ""I've never had that kind of abrupt, disgusting kind of disrespect levied at me.""

Approached a few hours later, Yoho declined to discuss any aspect of the exchange. ""No comment,"" he said.

Williams, who was in a position to hear the entire back-and-forth, said he wasn't paying it any mind.

""I was actually thinking, as I was walking down the stairs, I was thinking about some issues I've got in my district that need to get done,"" Williams said. ""I don't know what their topic was. There's always a topic, isn't there?""

At issue were comments Ocasio-Cortez made earlier in the month during a virtual town hall with the mothers of two Black men, Eric Garner and Ramarley Graham, who were killed in recent years by New York police officers.

During the event, Ocasio-Cortez was asked about gun violence in New York, which has spiked this summer as the nation's largest city — which was clobbered by the coronavirus — slowly reopens from a months-long lockdown.

Ocasio-Cortez, who represents parts of Queens and the Bronx, has long advocated for policies that cut police budgets and shift that funding to education, mental health and other social services. In her response, she stuck to that theme, suggesting the surge in crime stems from the economic hardship facing New York's poorest communities — and a failure of policymakers to fund programs aimed at leveling economic disparities.

“Crime is a problem of a diseased society, which neglects its marginalized people,"" she said during the July 9 event. ""Policing is not the solution to crime.”

Ocasio-Cortez went on to propose that ""economic desperation"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic — combined with glitches in the delivery of federal stimulus checks and unemployment payments — has helped trigger the crime spike.

""Maybe this has to do with the fact that people aren't paying their rent and are scared to pay their rent, and so they go out and they need to feed their child and they don't have money,"" she said. ""So ... they're put in a position where they feel like they either need to shoplift some bread or go hungry that night.""



Conservatives pounced, accusing Ocasio-Cortez of propounding tortured rationales to excuse violent crime.

“There’s a big difference between shoplifting and cold-blooded murder, and for her not to know the difference is frankly astonishing,” former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) said last week on Fox News.

On Monday, Ocasio-Cortez defended her position, saying she made clear during the town hall that she was referring to ""petty crime and crimes of poverty.""

Conservative media, she said, has purposefully taken her comments out of context.

""I say, 'Listen, I'm not talking about violent crime, I'm not talking about shootings. But when it comes to petty theft, a lot of these are crimes of poverty, and people are desperate,'"" she said. ""So the right wing cuts up this clip, per usual, in a very misleading way. ... They basically [want] to make it seem as though I'm saying people are shooting each other because they're hungry.""

Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged that her outspoken advocacy of liberal policies has made her an easy target of conservatives.

""Obviously, I'm no stranger to this,"" she said.

Yoho said that while he apologized for the curt manner in which the exchange happened, he feels passionate about the issue of poverty and says it’s an issue that needs to be debated.

“As my colleagues know, I'm passionate about those affected by poverty. My wife, Carolyn, and I started together at the age of 19 with nothing. We did odd jobs, and we were on food stamps.

""Today, we are waiting for an important response on several concerns, including on action to crush the virus. Ten days after Secretary Mnuchin went on CNBC to declare that he was accepting our testing plan, the Administration still refuses to do so,"" Pelosi wrote.

Pelosi and Mnuchin have been negotiating for weeks on a COVID-19 relief package that has included discussion of another round of stimulus checks to individuals, renewed enhanced unemployment insurance, tax credits and funds for the airline industry, in addition to a testing plan.

House Democrats have called for $75 billion for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing as part of their relief proposal. Earlier this month, Mnuchin said that he had largely agreed to Pelosi's demand for a national testing strategy with some minor changes.

""I think, quite frankly, we won't need to spend all that money, but we're happy to take the money,"" Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC at the time.

But more than a week later, what appeared to be progress in the negotiations that have dragged on since July has not yet yielded an agreement.

""Unless we have a national plan for testing, tracing, treatment, mask-wearing, social distancing and other science-based steps to crush the virus and combat the disparities facing communities of color, we cannot safely reopen our schools and economy. In all of our legislation, we have stressed the importance of testing, but the Administration has never followed through. The Republicans’ continued surrender to the virus — particularly amid the recent wave of cases — is official malfeasance,"" Pelosi wrote in Monday's letter.

The nation appears to be headed toward a third spike in coronavirus cases across the country.

The United States had seen a spike in coronavirus cases in April, another in Jul and is now experiencing a third surge. On Thursday, the country reported more than 75,000 new infections, a 32 percent jump from two weeks earlier, and more than 800 deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities above 223,000 — the highest in the world.

The rising numbers have threatened the summer's fragile economic recovery, as jobless claims are increasing, small businesses — particularly those in the service industries — are struggling to attract customers and the federal relief approved earlier in the year is drying up.

House Democrats threaten to subpoena HHS over allegations of political interference at CDC,"House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, threatened Thursday to issue subpoenas in the panel's investigation of alleged political interference by the Trump administration in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports on the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Clyburn warned that the department's lack of responsiveness to the requests for documents and interviews made by the committee more than a month ago meant that Democrats on the panel may turn to issuing subpoenas to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the first time since it was established this spring.

""This investigation is urgent because pervasive political interference at HHS appears to be contributing to the Trump administration’s ongoing failure to control the coronavirus, which is killing hundreds of Americans each day,"" Clyburn wrote in the letter obtained by The Hill. ""If you refuse to comply voluntarily, you will force the Select Subcommittee to consider issuing subpoenas.""

ADVERTISEMENT

A spokesperson for HHS said that the department has been waiting for the subcommittee to clarify “basic, standard questions” about logistics for the interviews.

Azar also said during testimony before the committee earlier this month that “our staffs are working to secure the agreements on the procedures to make that happen.”

“We want to make that happen,” Azar said.

Democrats on the select subcommittee launched an investigation on Sept. 14 in response to a Politico report showing that Trump administration political appointees have repeatedly interfered with the CDC's weekly scientific reports on the COVID-19 pandemic. In at least one email, an appointee accused the CDC of ""appear[ing] to be writing hit pieces on the administration"" and trying to ""hurt the president.""

At the time, Democrats on the panel asked for communications sent or received by CDC Director Robert Redfield about the reports and additional documents from other top officials. They also sought transcribed interviews with political and career CDC and HHS officials, including Michael Caputo, the then-assistant secretary for public affairs at HHS; Paul Alexander, a then-senior adviser at HHS responsible for the email cited by Politico; and top officials at the CDC responsible for the weekly reports.

ADVERTISEMENT

Alexander has left HHS, while Caputo has taken medical leave after accusing CDC officials of trying to undermine Trump in a Facebook post.

Clyburn cited recent communications with HHS in which officials questioned the need for the interviews and declined to provide documents in the weeks since the committee's original request.

He said that he is ""prepared to permit"" HHS counsel to participate in witness interviews and asked that the department respond by Oct. 26 whether it will comply with the interview and document requests.

""Withholding responsive documents and blocking key testimony are tactics of obstruction, not accommodation, especially in light of the Department’s failure to respond in full to at least six other requests from the Select Subcommittee since June 2020. If HHS has collected responsive documents, they should be produced at once — not withheld as leverage to delay transcribed interviews,"" Clyburn wrote.

Current and former CDC officials told The Hill last month that morale has sunk over the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic — which has to date resulted in the deaths of 222,000 people in the U.S. — and its attempts to downplay the severity of the virus.

“I have never seen morale this low. It’s just, people are beaten down. People are beaten down partially by a public who not only distrusts us but who actually think we want to infringe on their civil liberties,” one current CDC employee said at the time. “The other factor is the active undermining by senior members of our own administration.”",2020-10-22 15:25:45-04:00,

Speaking outside the White House, Trump cited the District’s coronavirus restrictions as the reason for the potential change in plans. The New York Times reported earlier Friday that Trump had called off plans to stage a party at Trump International Hotel in D.C. The gathering had not been formally announced but was mentioned in a campaign fundraising email.

“We haven’t made a determination. We have certain rules and regulations. You know, Washington, D.C., is shut down. The mayor shut it down,” Trump told reporters Friday before departing for campaign rallies in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota.

“We have a hotel. I don’t know if you’re allowed to use it or not, but I know the mayor has shut down Washington, D.C., and if that is the case we will probably stay here or pick another location,” he continued, labeling the District’s coronavirus rules “crazy.”

D.C. currently limits gatherings to 50 or fewer people. Trump has previously hosted larger crowds at the White House, which is federal property, for official and campaign-related events, including his Republican National Convention speech in August.

Late donor surges push election spending projections to new heights,"The campaigns for president, as well as Senate and House seats are likely to cost nearly $14 billion this year, more than twice as much as candidates and outside groups spent on the last presidential election cycle, according to a new projection.

The Center for Responsive Politics had already estimated that this election cycle would be the most expensive ever. But on Wednesday, the group upped its estimate by $3 billion, spurred by a late rush of donations from small-dollar and major donors alike.

“Donors poured record amounts of money into the 2018 midterms, and 2020 appears to be a continuation of that trend — but magnified,” said Sheila Krumholz, who runs the center.

Small-dollar donors giving less than $200 have contributed almost $2.8 billion to candidates and causes this year. Donors giving more than $200 have added up to $5.1 billion.

Biden, never a prolific fundraiser, is likely to be the first presidential candidate to raise $1 billion for his campaign account. Biden’s campaign had raised $938 million through Oct. 14, already making him the best-funded presidential candidate ever. That is on top of the $395 million the Democratic National Committee had hauled in.

Trump has raised $596 million for his own campaign. The Republican National Committee, effectively controlled by Trump’s political team, has raised $642 million for the cycle, boosting their own cash haul north of the 10-figure mark.

Outside groups have added to the eye-popping bottom line, and continue to do so even a week before Election Day. Super PACs and outside groups have already spent $1.2 billion in the month of October alone.

New voters surge to the polls,"More than 16 million voters who did not cast a ballot in 2016 have already voted this year, a sign that record-high enthusiasm in November’s elections will lead to an unprecedented turnout across the country.

There are indications that the surge is being fueled by younger voters who have been targets of turnout operations funded by Democratic groups, and by minorities who are motivated to vote like never before, data experts keeping tabs on the early numbers say.

Already this year, more than 4 million people between the ages of 18 and 29 have cast a ballot after sitting out 2016. They represent about two-thirds of all voters in that age bracket who have voted already. In states where voters can register by party, registered Democrats among those youngest voters outnumber registered Republicans by a nearly three to one margin.

“The central through thread from all of our conversations with young people throughout the year and the polls, whether ours or anyone else’s, [is that] they are more motivated to vote than ever before,” said Ben Wessel, executive director of NextGen America, a group funded by Tom Steyer Tom SteyerLate donor surges push election spending projections to new heights New voters surge to the polls Trump leads Biden in Texas by 4 points: poll MORE that works to turn out younger voters.

In Florida, more than 335,000 voters between 18 and 29 who did not vote in 2016 have voted so far. Half of those voters are registered Democrats; about a quarter are registered Republicans.

In Texas, which does not register voters by party, more than 2 million people who didn’t vote in 2016 have already voted this year. That includes more than 430,000 Hispanic voters, 140,000 African American voters, and 600,000 people under age 30.

More than 700,000 Georgia voters who did not vote in 2016 have already cast ballots. Almost a third of those voters are African American, and nearly 30 percent are under 30 years old.

Across the nation, 4.7 million voters have voted for the first time this year. Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost half a million, though nearly two-thirds of that group are not affiliated with a party or live in states that do not register by party. Forty percent of those first-time voters are under 30 years old, Bonier’s data show.

“You see younger voters make up a larger share of the early vote electorate than they did in 2016 just about everywhere,” said Tom Bonier, chief executive at TargetSmart Consulting, which tracks early vote data.

ADVERTISEMENT

There are anecdotal signs of a younger voter surge, too: One precinct in San Marcos, Texas, that covers the campus of Texas State University, surpassed the total number of votes cast in 2016 over the weekend, nine days before Election Day. Half of all registered voters in Johnson County, Iowa, home of the University of Iowa, have already voted.

But, Bonier said, it is not only younger voters who are turning out in higher numbers. Millions of seniors who did not vote in 2016 have cast ballots; to date, more seniors who have college degrees have voted in nine battleground states than voted in all of 2016, either before or on Election Day.

Black seniors have been an especially strong growth market this year. More Black voters over the age of 65 have voted in Texas and Georgia than voted in all of 2016.

“There are actually a lot of seniors who stayed home in ’16, which is not something we really focused on,” Bonier said. “When you look at the non-2016 seniors who have voted already, they’re more Democratic than the inverse, seniors who have voted already who did vote in 2016.”

If there are warning signs for Democrats, they may come from the huge number of non-college white voters who are casting ballots, a group at the core of President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s base. Like other groups, those voters have turned to early options in record numbers.

Nationally, more than 29 million non-college whites have cast their ballots. They represent a lower share of the electorate, 46 percent, than at this point in 2016, 52 percent. But in raw numbers, those voters are still the largest cohort in the electorate, edging college-educated white voters by a margin of nearly 9.5 million.

Some Democratic strategists warned that minority communities, and especially the Black community, is lagging behind in a key state like Florida. Several groups, funded or run by luminaries like the actor Tyler Perry and 2018 gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum (D), are running special drives to get those Black voters to the polls.

Four years ago, President Trump won Florida on the strength of unprecedented turnout among rural white voters who rarely cast ballots. This year, those voters are showing up again, a promising sign for Trump’s hopes of keeping his adopted home state.

“There’s a disparity when you start cutting the data by race. You’ve got new and sporadic white voters who are turning out on both an absolute and percentage basis more than communities of color,” said Josh Mendelsohn, who runs Hawkfish, a political technology firm founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg Michael BloombergLate donor surges push election spending projections to new heights New voters surge to the polls What a Biden administration should look like MORE. “African American and Hispanic, Latino turnout just isn’t tracking with the same positive momentum. That’s an area of concern, and I don’t think it can be avoided.”

The pandemic coupled with both parties’ campaigns to get their most ardent supporters to vote early has led to a surge in early votes across the nation, and across demographic groups. Through Wednesday morning, more than 74 million Americans had already cast their ballot, according to the United States Elections Project, run by University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald.

That represents more than half the 138.8 million ballots cast during the entirety of the 2016 election cycle.

Tens of millions more people will still wait until Election Day to vote, the turnout experts said. Polls show Republican voters, especially, are more eager to vote on Election Day itself, perhaps a reflection of President Trump’s rants against mail-in voting — and in spite of his own campaign’s efforts to get Republican voters to vote early.

ADVERTISEMENT

As Democrats build a lead in early votes, they are digging a hole from which Trump must extricate himself on Election Day. His path to a majority remains possible, but it becomes more complicated by the day.

“There is logically some level of election day turnout for Republicans that allows them to still win this thing,” Bonier said. “It’s just that as this early voting advantage continues to pile up, that becomes more and more implausible.”",2020-10-28 14:19:27-04:00,

For weeks, Democrats have been counting on the former prosecutor to deliver a flawless performance. But as Trump recovers from his bout with the coronavirus, Harris will have to do a delicate dance of sorts to hold the administration accountable without burning the ailing president.

“She can deliver a blow better than any politician,” Simmons said.

But she also has had some weaknesses. He pointed to a debate during the Democratic primary last year when Rep.

But they also set expectations low when it came to torching the president. One source close to the campaign said it will be similar to the tone taken by Biden at his speech in Michigan on Friday.

Part of the strategy is to demonstrate the difference in approach between the Biden campaign and the Trump campaign.

Kirk Wagar, a former ambassador and Democratic mega-donor who knows Harris well, added that “as long as people can see the competence, pragmatism and decency of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,” in the debate, “I feel pretty good about it.”

Harris just last month acknowledged feeling some pressure about the face-off with Pence, setting expectations.

“Let me just say something,” she said, interrupting California Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins, who was hosting the virtual fundraiser event.

“He’s a good debater. So, I’m so concerned, like I can only disappoint,” Harris said, laughing.

“Because literally, he’s a very, he’s a very good debater … so I definitely am going to prepare for this debate like I have for previous debates. But I take this debate very seriously. And I think we can expect he’s going to be very good,” Harris said.

Trump might have helped Harris just a bit with his comments after leaving Walter Reed hospital in Bethesda, Md. Trump said he was “feeling really good” and “better than I did 20 years ago,” which some Republicans said gave Democrats license to ramp up the attacks.

“Donald Trump declaring himself in better health than ever frees up the Biden campaign to go back on the offensive after Trump and his handling of coronavirus and we’ll see that most immediately coming from Kamala Harris,” said Republican strategist Doug Heye.

Those who know Harris say the moment is tailor-made for her.

“She always steps up for the big moments,” said one aide. “She actually shines in the big moments more so than the moments when no one is watching.”

The Biden campaign has sought to make the campaign a referendum on Trump and his handling of the pandemic. Events in the past 48 hours, the Biden camp believes, have played into that game plan. And they believe it will play with voters watching the debate.

“Kamala Harris is the anti-Trump,” said Mike Nellis, a Democratic consultant and a senior adviser during her presidential campaign last year. “Instead of spewing lies into a microphone or being dangerously cavalier about COVID … That’s exactly what voters have been looking for, especially after this last week.”",2020-10-07 06:00:22-04:00,

LEADING THE DAY:

Democratic nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE met with the family of Jacob Blake and listened to emotional testimony from citizens in Kenosha, Wis., on Thursday.

Biden arrived in Kenosha and immediately huddled with Blake’s father, brother, two sisters and members of his legal team. Blake and his mother called in from the hospital.

Blake’s attorney, Ben Crump, described the 90-minute meeting as focused on “the disparate treatment of minorities in police interactions, the impact of selecting Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden begins two-day campaign sprint in battleground Pennsylvania Trump praises Texas supporters who surrounded Biden-Harris bus FBI investigating Biden bus surrounded by pro-Trump cars: report MORE as a Black woman as his running mate, and Vice President Biden’s plans for change.”

“The vice president told the family that he believes the best of America is in all of us and that we need to value all our differences as we come together in America’s great melting pot,” Crump said. “It was very obvious that Vice President Biden cared, as he extended to Jacob Jr. a sense of humanity, treating him as a person worthy of consideration and prayer.”

Later, Biden attended a small community event at Grace Lutheran Church, where he heard emotional testimony from people who live in Kenosha. Biden heard from a white business owner who said her store had been destroyed by rioters and a Black attorney who pleaded with him to address criminal justice reform.

Biden mostly listened, but he got up in the middle of the event and accused President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE of inflaming racial tensions. The former vice president pointed to the president’s response to the white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville as evidence of his failed leadership on race.

“It’s not all [Trump’s] fault,” Biden said of the racial divisions seizing America. “But it legitimized a dark side of human nature. What it did though, was also expose what had not been paid enough attention to. The underlying racism that is institutionalized in the United States that still exists and has for 400 years. So we end up with a circumstance like we have here in Kenosha.”

Trump toured Kenosha earlier in the week to highlight the businesses that had been destroyed as part of the protests. The president has blamed Democratic officials in cities for allowing protesters to destroy property.

“Let’s get something straight here, protesting is protesting…but none of it justifies burning, looting or anything else,” Biden said. “So regardless how angry you are, if you loot or burn you should be held accountable the same as someone who has done anything else, period.”

YOU CAN ONLY VOTE ONCE:

Trump’s remarks to a local North Carolina affiliate on Wednesday that people should vote twice has ignited fury and blowback from Democrats and election watchdogs. In the interview, Trump appeared to be telling people to send in their mail ballots and to vote in-person under the assumption that their mail ballots will not have been received.

“They will vote and then they are going to have to check their vote by going to the poll and voting that way because if it tabulates then they won’t be able to do that. So let them send it in, and let them go vote. And if the system is as good as they say it is, then they obviously won’t be able to vote. If it isn’t tabulated, they will be able to vote. So that’s the way it is, and that’s what they should do.” - Trump

It is illegal to vote twice. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany played clean up on Thursday, saying the president was not suggesting people “do anything unlawful.” McEnany said Trump was telling voters to “verify” that their mailed ballot is counted.

“The president is not suggesting anyone do anything unlawful. What he said very clearly there is make sure your vote is tabulated and if it is not, then vote.” - McEnany

The nonpartisan elections watchdog Common Cause said that Trump’s call for voters to cast two ballots was itself a felony for inciting a felony.

“Americans expect and deserve more from their President than statements urging his supporters to commit a felony by voting for him twice in the coming election. President Trump’s repeated requests to his followers to commit felonies are felony crimes themselves because he is inciting the commission of those crimes.” - Common Cause

The North Carolina State Board of Elections reminded voters that it is illegal to cast a ballot twice. In a statement, officials noted that voting more than once in the same election is a felony and that audits are conducted after each election to catch anyone violating the law.

""It is illegal to vote twice in an election. Attempting to vote twice in an election or soliciting someone to do so also is a violation of North Carolina law."" - NCSBE Director Karen Brinson Bell

POLLING ROUNDUP

Speaking of North Carolina…

Biden and Trump are statistically tied in the Tar Heel State. That’s according to a new Monmouth University poll released on Thursday. The survey shows Biden with a scant 2-point lead over Trump — a negligible advantage given the poll’s +/-4.9 percentage point margin of error. Overall, Biden garners 47 percent support to Trump’s 45 percent.

More on that poll here.

A new Quinnipiac University poll out of Pennsylvania yields a sunnier picture for Biden, who leads Trump there 52 percent to 44 percent, well outside the survey’s +/-3 point margin of error.

But the presidential race in Florida remains tight. Another Quinnipiac survey out of the Sunshine State showed Biden with a 3-point advantage over Trump, 48 percent to 45 percent. That’s not much given the poll’s +/-2.8 point margin of error. But it’s also not particularly unexpected. As the nation’s largest swing state, Florida has a reputation for deciding elections by ultra-slim margins and there’s no reason to think this year will be any different.

Max has more on the Quinnipiac polling here and here.

TECH PRESSURE:

Facebook is taking a major step in how its handling political advertisements in the run-up to the election. The platform announced on Thursday it would ban new advertisements in the week ahead of the election.

The move is apart of the social media giant’s effort to halt the spread of disinformation in order to ""secure the integrity of this year's elections.""

“More than 180,000 Americans are dead from a pandemic that, with consistent leadership, could have been contained. Instead, it has been left to spin out of control by a President who ignored it, refused to lead, and endangered American lives,” Whitman said in a statement. “In this moment of great national crisis, we need to elect a leader matched to the moment, someone who can restore competence to the oval office and unify the country. Joe Biden is that leader.”

Liberal activists and even some junior Democratic senators are warning against spending too much time trying to compromise with Republicans in 2021 if Democrats win control of both the White House and Senate, which looks increasingly likely.

They remember the months wasted in 2009 when former President Obama patiently negotiated with GOP leaders to pass a $789 billion fiscal stimulus plan — which in retrospect many Democrats now concede should have been larger to jumpstart an economy that was in recession — and a bipartisan health care reform package, which Senate Republicans refused to endorse in the end.

“You would hope that he learned the lesson from the Obama years,” Bob Borosage, co-founder of Campaign For America’s Future, a liberal advocacy group, said of Biden. “He’s done his closing argument in the campaign around bipartisanship, reaching across the aisle and bringing the country together.”

“It reflects his long pride in himself as being able to work across the aisle. It’s a real concern he might go the wrong way. My fear is not that he goes the wrong way forever but he decides, ‘Let’s try and see if they’re going to operate in good faith,’ as if we haven’t had more than enough proof from Mitch McConnell about what kind of faith he operates in,” he added.

Biden came under fire during the Democratic primary when he talked about his civil relationships with the late Sens. James Eastland (D-Miss.) and Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.), two segregationist Dixiecrats, early in his Senate career.

Biden and Schumer will have to juggle the priorities and political interests of what could be an incoming class of Senate Democratic moderates, such as former Colorado Gov.

One of the biggest questions will be how aggressively to move on health care, which Schumer is making Democrats’ top issue in 2020. Senators are debating whether to focus on repairing the damage Republicans wrought under President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE to the Affordable Care Act, or push bolder ideas, like the public option or expanding Medicare to people aged 55 and over. There’s also a debate over how quickly to move on the issue.

Some Democratic moderates are already pushing back against the demands of liberal activists.

One Senate Democratic aide warned that incoming Democratic senators who narrowly defeat GOP incumbents can’t be expected to embrace proposals like filibuster reform as soon as they get to Washington.

The aide, responding to the harsh criticism of Feinstein, said “people who are saying we should fight more are a loud subset of the Twitter-verse” who “don’t know anything about winning elections or Senate procedure” and who “are trying to raise money.”

The aide noted that Kelly, who is running in a special election against Sen. Martha McSally Martha Elizabeth McSallyMore veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress Senate candidates focus closing arguments on health care, experience Senate battle threatens to spill into overtime MORE (R-Ariz.), will be up for reelection in 2022, when the late Sen.

McSally was appointed to fill McCain’s seat after he died.

The desire not to work with Republicans was on full display Thursday after Feinstein’s praise of Graham’s leadership, when she expressed hope about working on bipartisan legislation in the future, sparked outrage on the left.

Demand Justice, a group co-founded by Brian Fallon, a former Schumer aide, and other prominent voices on the left, called on Feinstein to step down as the top Democrat on the committee.

NARAL Pro-Choice America on Friday accused Feinstein of lending “credibility” to Judge Amy Coney Barrett Amy Coney BarrettThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law If it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Pittsburgh newspaper backs Trump in first GOP presidential endorsement since 1972 MORE’s confirmation hearings, which it called “unprecedented, shameful and wrong.”

“As such, we believe the committee needs new leadership,” NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement.

Senate Democratic aides say they doubt Schumer would move to demote Feinstein after the election if Senate Democrats win the majority, but they acknowledge he will be under some pressure to do so.

Committee chairs in the Democratic caucus are based on seniority in each committee and approved of through a caucus vote.

“I can see the outside groups doing something and if anything happens, it’s possible that Chuck could persuade her to hand over the gavel if we become the majority. But I think that persuasion effort is going to be really challenging,” said a second Senate Democratic aide.

“If we stay in the minority, nobody’s going to do a damn thing,” the aide added, but warned that if Democrats are in control, there will be a lot of pressure on how Feinstein runs the committee.

Feinstein’s moment of collegiality with Graham angered many liberals and Democratic activists, prompting calls for a shakeup of the Democratic establishment and new leadership voices.

Neil Sroka, a spokesman for Democracy for America, a liberal grass-roots advocacy group, said Feinstein’s praise of Graham while Republicans are in the process of ramming Trump’s conservative Supreme Court nominee through the Senate as quickly as possible was a poke in the eye.

“It’s a burn from a broken Democratic establishment in the United States Senate that underscores who in the Democratic Party has been obstructing the reforms that need to happen in the Senate to make it a functional institution at this point and why those people shouldn’t be in power anymore,” Sroka said.

Another headache for Schumer is how to deal with liberal colleagues and outside activists who will immediately call for filibuster reform if Democrats win back the White House and Senate.

Borosage said if Biden is in the Oval Office and Schumer becomes majority leader, the push for filibuster reform will be “immediate and fierce” and “pushed by a whole coalition of grassroots groups with lots of pressure on senators.”

“It will be very fast. It will happen immediately,” he said. “There’s no question people don’t have any desire to go back through what Obama did, where you fritter away your majority in idle pursuit of supposedly moderate Republican votes.”

Schumer has repeatedly deflected questions about whether he would support scrapping the Senate filibuster, arguing that Democrats first need to find out whether they will be in the majority and how big their majority might be.

Schumer could also face calls from Democratic colleagues to share more power throughout the caucus. While he expanded the Democratic leadership team when he took over as Senate minority leader after the 2017 elections, much of what Senate Democrats do is coordinated through his office.

“If Republicans proceed as expected, Democrats will have every right to consider Barrett illegitimate and pursue structural reform to restore ideological balance to the court,” said Brian Fallon, the executive director of the progressive group Demand Justice.

But supporters of court reforms face an uphill climb even if Democrats find themselves with a trifecta next year for the first time since 2010, when they lost the House in a Tea Party wave.

The main headache for progressives — beyond getting Biden, a decades-long institutionalist, on board — is the tough math they face that is likely to leave them little room for error and needing nearly every, if not every, vote among Senate Democrats.

Absent a Democratic wave, their margin is likely to be narrow. While FiveThirtyEight, for example, gives the Democrats a 73 percent chance of winning back the Senate, it rates the most likely outcome as a 51-49 split, followed by 52-48 and then 50-50.

Expanding the number of Supreme Court seats would require two steps: nixing the 60-vote legislative filibuster and then passing legislation to change the number of justices from nine.

“I will do anything and everything I can in a bipartisan way to make this place work,” Manchin said. “I’m going to be bipartisan, and nobody is going to stop me or change me, OK?”

Those senators will face intense pressure from outside groups as well as some of their colleagues to shift their positions if Democrats find themselves in the majority in January.

""How do I think we should get back to an independent judiciary? ... We should go back to having a filibuster in place for judicial nominees,"" Gideon said during the debate.

Senators can still technically filibuster court picks, but the move is toothless because it requires only a simple majority — the same number needed to confirm a nominee — to break the procedural deadlock. Democrats in 2013 nixed the 60-vote filibuster for lower court picks and executive nominees, and Republicans got rid of the same threshold for Supreme Court nominees in 2017.

10 under-the-radar races to watch in November,"The battle for control of the White House this year will break every spending record anyone has bothered to keep. The fight for power in Congress will cost billions more.

But below the surface, high-stakes contests are underway across the nation, from the state house to city hall. Here are ten races to keep an eye on in November:

Alaska’s House of Representatives

ADVERTISEMENT

Republicans hold 23 of 40 seats in Alaska’s state House of Representatives in what should be a clear governing majority backing Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R). But in practice, a handful of recalcitrant Republicans have joined Democrats and independents to form a coalition that keeps Dunleavy in check.

The coalition has so infuriated national Republicans that major outside groups funneled $200,000 into primary challenges against sitting Republican incumbents.

Three Republican coalition members lost their bids for renomination in August, one quit earlier this year and one died in a plane crash, putting those who stuck with Dunleavy in position to reclaim control. But there are strange things done in the midnight sun, and nothing in Alaska is ever guaranteed until the votes are counted.

Portland mayor’s race

This summer’s protests for racial justice were mostly peaceful — but not in Portland, Ore., where activists clashed with federal agents and where supporters of President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE staged their own provocative rallies. The clashes got so bad that Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) moved out of his condominium to escape the protests.

Wheeler finished the May primary with 49 percent of the vote, just shy of what he needed to win a second term outright — right before the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, which sparked Portland’s tumultuous summer of rage.

Now Wheeler faces a challenge from Sarah Iannarone, an educator and activist at Portland State University making her second run for office. More than half of Portland residents say the city is headed on the wrong track, and a recent poll showed Wheeler and Iannarone statistically tied, with about a quarter of voters undecided.

Washington secretary of state and lieutenant governor

Democrats are firmly in control of Washington State government, where a Republican last won the governorship in 1980. But Republicans maintain a foothold in the secretary of state’s office, where they have held power since 1965.

That streak, kept alive by incumbent Kim Wyman (R), is coming under serious pressure this year from state Rep. Gael Tarleton (D), a former Seattle port commissioner who scored 43 percent in this summer’s all-party primary against Wyman’s 51 percent. Wyman’s fate will be the latest sign of just how large the population of true ticket-splitting voters remains.

In the race for lieutenant governor, two Democrats finished atop a crowded field in the primary. Rep. Denny Heck Dennis (Denny) Lynn HeckExclusive: Guccifer 2.0 hacked memos expand on Pennsylvania House races Heck enjoys second political wind Incoming lawmaker feeling a bit overwhelmed MORE (D) led the way, a rare instance of a member of Congress coming home for what appears to be a less influential job — Washington’s lieutenant governor holds a few ceremonial roles and runs the state Senate.

But Heck — or state Sen. Marko Liias, the other Democrat who made it through the primary — may be in line for a promotion, if a future Biden administration were to tap Gov.

Inslee firmly denies he’s interested in going back to the other Washington, and Heck insists he’s not in it for the prospects of an upgrade to the governor’s mansion.

North Carolina attorney general

North Carolina voters love kicking out their incumbents. In just the past few decades, Sens. Kay Hagan Kay Ruthven Hagan10 under-the-radar races to watch in November The Hill's Campaign Report: Democratic Unity Taskforce unveils party platform recommendations Democrats awash with cash in battle for Senate MORE (D), Elizabeth Dole (R), Lauch Faircloth (R) and Terry Sanford (D) have lost reelection bids, and Sen.

But for all the tumult, North Carolina seems happy to stick with a Democrat in the attorney general’s office. No Republican has won election to the job in 120 years. The only Republican to hold the post in that span, James Carson, was appointed in 1974; he lost the subsequent special election.

This year, incumbent Josh Stein (D) is seeking a second term against Jim O’Neill (R), the district attorney in Forsyth County. Stein won the job by a margin of just 20,000 votes, or 0.4 percentage points, in 2016.

West Virginia governor

The Mountaineer State hasn’t elected a Republican governor since Cecil Underwood came out of retirement in 1996 — and that includes Gov. Jim Justice, who won election as a Democrat in 2016 and switched parties the following year.

Justice’s apostasy enraged national Democrats, who promptly dumped their book of opposition research they had compiled on their erstwhile colleague. And he wasn’t fully embraced by Republicans in the legislature, with whom he spent most of his first term fighting.

But in a state they once ruled with an iron fist, Democrats struggled to come up with a candidate. Justice is likely to beat out Kanawha County Commissioner Ben Salango (D) and several minor party contenders to win a second term — this time wearing the other team’s uniform.

Maricopa County elections

Maricopa County is the largest county in America that President Trump carried in 2016. Four years later, the mood in Phoenix and its surrounding suburbs has changed dramatically.

Republicans held a 150,000-voter advantage in Maricopa County in 2016, an edge that has been cut almost in half. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D) won the county in 2018, and Democrats made gains that year in state legislative races.

ADVERTISEMENT

This year, Democrats are contesting four of the five seats on the County Board of Supervisors — the fifth seat is held by an incumbent Democrat who does not face a Republican challenger. Democrats have the opportunity to oust County Attorney Allister Adel (R), and Sheriff Paul Penzone (D), who beat the notorious Joe Arpaio in 2016, is a favorite for reelection.

The Phoenix television market has been the epicenter of the presidential contest, where candidates and outside groups have advertised more than any other market in America. If Maricopa turns blue, it will bring the rest of Arizona with it.

Ohio Supreme Court

Ohio voters took control of the decennial redistricting process out of the legislature’s hands a few years ago and handed it to an independent commission. When that commission meets, the maps it produces will surely face legal challenges that will work their way up to the state Supreme Court.

The makeup of that court is on the ballot this year, as Justices Judith French and Sharon Kennedy seek reelection. While ostensibly nonpartisan, French and Kennedy each ran — unopposed — in Republican primaries. Their challengers, former Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner and Cuyahoga County Judge John O’Donnell, won Democratic primaries.

A Democratic sweep of both races would hand Democrats a four-to-three majority on the high court. It would be the first Democratic majority in more than three decades. Outside groups have poured money into the race in anticipation of legal battles ahead.

California Proposition 22

When California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D) shepherded Assembly Bill 5 through the legislature last year, she opened the flood gates through which big tech companies have poured more than $180 million this year.

The law, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom Gavin NewsomWalmart reverses decision to remove guns, ammo from sales floors ICE agents told to be ready for unrest in DC on Election Day California governor preparing state for civil unrest following election MORE (D), classifies gig workers as employees of the companies for which they work. Those companies — led by Uber, Lyft and DoorDash — paid to get Proposition 22 on the ballot, which would permanently classify those workers as independent contractors.

Unions have poured about $10 million into the opposition campaign to save AB 5. But California voters are inundated by advertising — including when they open one of those gig apps on their mobile phones — in favor of the proposition.

What happens in California today frequently happens across the country tomorrow. The future of the gig economy may be on the ballot.

Illinois constitutional amendment

Two of the richest men in Illinois are fighting an increasingly expensive battle over how much they should be taxed.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D), an heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune, has dumped more than $56 million into the campaign to amend the state constitution to allow Illinois to institute a graduated income tax. Ken Griffin, the billionaire hedge fund manager and Republican donor, has spent more than $46 million against the amendment.

There haven’t been any public polls released recently, but a poll in March conducted by the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute found Illinois voters favored the idea by a two-to-one margin.

Expect the measure to be a hot topic the next time the extended Pritzker family gets together for dinner. Pritzker’s cousin Jennifer has contributed half a million dollars against the amendment.

Anti-Racist Ballot Measures

State constitutions are bulky, unwieldy documents, amended so often over the years that more than a few have some pretty antiquated language left over from the long-distant past. Voters in five states will have the chance to change some of that outdated thinking through constitutional amendments on the ballot this year.

In Alabama, voters will be asked to give the legislature the power to remove some racist language that requires schools to be segregated by race. That provision has not been enforced since the 1960s, but it remains in the state’s founding document.

Mississippi voters will be asked to end a Jim Crow-era provision that requires a candidate for governor to win a majority of the 122 state House districts, along with a majority of the popular vote. The provision was implemented back in 1890, as a fail-safe against the possibility of a Black candidate winning the governorship simply by winning the popular vote.

The Magnolia State will also ask voters to ratify a new flag, a design that includes the state flower, after the legislature retired an old version that included the Confederate battle flag.

Nebraska and Utah voters have the chance to remove provisions from their constitutions that still allow slavery as a punishment for a criminal conviction. Neither state has actually used the provision allowing slavery for more than a century, but the outdated language is still there.

And the state with the longest official name will ask voters to chop off some rather unfortunate wording. Voters in the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations — that’s its official name — will decide whether to remove the Providence Plantations part.

Utah voters also have the chance to be a little more inclusive in their own constitution. The current document alludes several times to men exclusively: It says all men have an inherent right to life and liberty, and it refers to some state office holders as “he.” That language would be changed to be more gender-inclusive, substituting words like “persons” for more specific words like “men.”",2020-10-25 08:00:00-04:00,
On The Trail: A third coronavirus wave builds just before Election Day,"A new wave of viral infections is washing over the nation just weeks before Election Day, putting a new spotlight on a crisis that has come to define President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s struggle for reelection.

For months, public health experts have warned of an increase in the number of cases that would accompany lower temperatures in the fall and winter. As people move inside more, they said, the coronavirus was likely to spread.

Those predictions have come true — earlier and more significantly than expected.

“We’re in a really precarious time,” said David Rubin, a pediatrician who runs the PolicyLab at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, whose models show devolving situations across much of the nation. The pandemic “is accelerating, and it’s accelerating quickly. We’re now seeing hospitals exceeding capacity in the Upper Midwest, in Salt Lake, where hospitals are filling up, and it’s just mid-October.”

The number of new coronavirus infections confirmed over the last week rose in 44 states compared to the week prior, according to The Hill’s analysis. Cases have declined for two or more consecutive weeks in just two states, California and Hawaii.

Several states now rank at the top of the worst outbreaks in the world. In North Dakota, where Gov. Doug Burgum (R) has resisted any new restrictions, the per capita infection rate last week was 711 per 100,000 residents — a rate more than twice as high as New York’s during its initial surge in April, and almost two times larger than the worst outbreaks in states like Arizona and Florida over the summer.

More than one in every 200 residents of South Dakota, and more than one in every 250 residents of Montana and Wisconsin, tested positive for the virus in just the past seven days. Texas recorded 36,000 new cases in the last week, while Illinois, California and Florida all reported more than 20,000 additional cases.

Case data show that more younger people are contracting the virus. While those younger people are less likely to be hospitalized or die, more infections will by nature lead to more people in the hospital. And those younger people, even asymptomatic ones, may become vectors who expose older and less healthy people with whom they come into contact.

“What we know from the experience from the summer is that rising cases in younger people tends to be followed by a rise in cases among more vulnerable people,” said Rich Besser, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now heads the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “If you look at the curves and the trends in America, they’re very concerning.”

Already, Wisconsin has opened an auxiliary field hospital to deal with surging demand for care. More than 80 percent of intensive care unit beds in Alabama, Kentucky and Rhode Island are occupied. Hospitalizations have increased in 38 states over the last two weeks, according to the Covid Exit Strategy, a group of independent researchers.

The spike in cases comes at a disastrous time for Trump’s reelection campaign. Trump has tried to change the focus of the contest to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE's son Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China, to sometimes violent protests in Democratic-controlled cities, and to an economic comeback he says has already begun.

But voters give Trump disastrous marks on handling a pandemic that has already killed more Americans than the population of Tacoma, Wash., or Baton Rouge, La. Polls conducted this month for NPR; NBC and The Wall Street Journal; ABC and The Washington Post; and CNN all show between 37 percent and 41 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the virus, while a majority say they disapprove.

“He’s not going to be able to escape what the news is on the ground because this is happening very quickly,” Rubin said.

The polls show voters trust Joe Biden to handle the pandemic far more than Trump: The NPR poll, conducted by Marist College, found 55 percent trusted Biden to better handle the virus, compared to just 41 percent who thought Trump would do a better job. In the ABC/Washington Post poll, Biden led 55 percent to 38 percent.

The Trump administration has shown little appetite for renewed lockdowns or mitigation efforts to stem the spread of the virus. Governors have chafed at the lack of federal planning, even seven months after the first wave of lockdowns; personal protective equipment remains in short supply, there is no national testing strategy, and Trump himself has continued to promise a miracle that has not materialized.

Instead, he has pushed states to lift restrictions and reopen the economy as he listens to advisers like Scott Atlas, a medical doctor who does not have training in epidemiology or virology. The White House has embraced the Great Barrington Declaration, a document that advocates allowing the virus to run its natural course through younger people — who are still at risk of death or long-term disease.

“It’s frightening to envision a strategy of allowing an infectious agent to spread through the community in order to eventually lead to decreases in spread. It makes no sense,” Besser said. “It would benefit us to have a big dose of humility in terms of how much we know about this infection.”

Trump has also begun taking the most overt shots yet at Anthony Fauci Anthony FauciSenior adviser points to vaccine when pressed on Trump's comments about 'rounding the corner' on pandemic Davis: 5 questions for Trump voters Fauci rips White House coronavirus approach MORE, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease — a man the public trusts far more than they trust Trump.

Public health experts and economists alike warn that the economic catastrophe wrought by the pandemic will not let up until the health crisis is under control.

“The time to act is now so that you don’t have to put more burdensome restrictions on later,” Rubin said. “People’s unwillingness to do practical restrictions is going to end up in restrictions that are more noxious later on.”

There are other signs that bold action to combat the virus pay electoral dividends: In New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s government led a crackdown that has virtually eliminated the virus there, voters gave her Labour Party an outright majority of seats in national elections last week — the first time any party has won a majority since the country began using a mixed-member proportional system to elect its representatives in 1996.

The government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic was a top concern of voters in New Zealand, just as it will be in the United States.

Trump “is reaping what he has sown,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former head of USAID’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. “Just as Jacinda Ardern did a few days ago, in a rather different way.”

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE has broadly sought to make the November election a referendum on Trump's handling of the virus, bringing up the United States's status as the country with the highest number of cases and early testing lags to criticize the president.

Trump and Biden faced off in their first presidential debate Tuesday night, locking horns over the administration's efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19, among other topics.

Biden noted during the debate that Trump privately told journalist Bob Woodward in February that the coronavirus was ""more deadly"" than the flu, despite saying otherwise in public at the time. Trump's remarks to Woodward were published last month in a book.

The Democratic rival used the debate to cite Trump's response to the high COVID-19 death toll last month when he said ""they are dying. That's true. And you — it is what it is.""

""It is what it is because you are who you are,"" Biden said to Trump on Tuesday. “The president has no plan. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was.""

At another moment, Biden turned to look into the camera, saying, ""How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the table because someone died of COVID-19?""

Trump pushed back on the criticism, arguing the death toll would have been higher if Biden were president. He also touted his decision in January to shut down most travel into the U.S. from China, something he has frequently highlighted.

The two candidates did not shake hands or interact closely onstage at the debate, though they were onstage together for more than 90 minutes.

The Hill has reached out to the Biden campaign for further comment on the president’s diagnosis and whether the former vice president will be tested following Tuesday night’s debate. The Trump campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.

For months, Trump declined to wear a face covering in public, despite the urging of his top public health officials who sought to tamp down on a spreading number of cases in a several Southern and Western states at the time.

Trump wore a mask for the first time in July during a visit to Walter Reed hospital in Maryland to visit wounded service members and health staff who had cared for COVID-19 patients. Since then, Trump has worn a mask on several occasions and referenced it for the press, something he did during Tuesday's debate as well.

With his positive test, Trump joins a number of other world leaders who have contracted the disease, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Monaco's Prince Albert II. Johnson, in particular, suffered a serious case of COVID-19 and spent three nights in the intensive care unit in April as that nation battled a high number of cases.

Other leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, had to quarantine after being around someone who tested positive for the disease.

Others acknowledged the gravity of the president himself contracting the disease given the number of precautions taken to keep him away from those believed to be at risk of having the virus.

""It really is punishing. It's unforgiving. It draws no distinction between Republicans and Democrats,” he said.

The California Democrat said that while he doesn't want to see Trump's symptoms get worse, the positive test ""should be a wake up call for all of us to get serious.""

""And maybe it’ll provoke the president and his team to come to the table so that we can get the relief package passed,” the lawmaker continued, referencing the talks between House Democrats and administration officials.

President Trump made a surprise appearance in the convention hall in Charlotte, N.C., where he touted the administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and said he’d rebuild the economy to where it was before the “plague.”

“We’re getting ready to do things like nobody has ever seen before, but the best way to bring unity is success,” Trump said. “Success brings unity and we were there and then we got hit with the plague and we won’t forget that.”

The president said the economy is on pace for a “super V-shaped” recovery and he accused Democrats of trying to keep business closed during the pandemic to hurt him politically.

“They want our numbers to look as bad as possible,” Trump said.

Trump also railed against the expansion of mail voting, calling it the “greatest scam in the history of politics.”

The president, who has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud in mail voting, accused Democrats of “trying to steal the election from Republicans.”

While the Republican National Convention in Charlotte has been scaled back dramatically due to the coronavirus pandemic, Republicans officially nominated Trump through an in-person roll call vote, with delegates standing up to declare their support for the president.

Vice President Pence addressed the convention before Trump, touting the administration’s efforts the past four years to renegotiate trade deals, confirm conservative judges and lower taxes.

“The choice in this election has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher,” Pence said.

“Men and women of the Republican National Convention, it’s on,"" he added. ""Now is the time. This is the moment for each of us to everything in our power to reelect this president to four more years.”

There was no drama in the nominating process. Trump faced primary challenges from several Republicans, including former Massachusetts Gov.

Polls show the Republican Party is largely united behind Trump, despite the vocal opposition from former GOP lawmakers and officials who appeared at Biden's convention last week.

Trump begins the final stretch to Nov. 3 trailing Biden in the polls and juggling multiple crises, including the coronavirus pandemic and related economic slowdown, and the racial turmoil that has spread across the nation following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Democrats have focused on Trump’s handling of the pandemic to argue that he is in over his head and ill-equipped to lead the country’s recovery. Polls show a majority of the public disapproves of the Trump administration’s response to the outbreak.

Biden leads Trump by 7.6 points nationally, according to the RealClearPolitics average, down from a lead of 10.2 points in late June. However, experts say Trump can win the Electoral College if he can close the national gap with Biden to about 4 points.

Biden also leads by 5 points or more in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania, according to the RealClearPolitics average. Polls show the race is effectively a toss-up in Arizona and North Carolina.

But the Trump campaign has been dismissive of polls showing Trump is trailing Biden.

He effectively ran the table in the battleground states and won narrow victories in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, pulling off the most shocking political upset in modern times.

There has been some good polling news for Trump recently. Last week, new surveys of Pennsylvania and Minnesota showed Trump running even with Biden. The Trump campaign has circled Minnesota, New Hampshire and Maine as states Clinton won in 2016 they believe they can flip in 2020.

Biden received a 5-point boost in favorability coming out of last week’s Democratic convention, according to new Reuters-Ipsos data, and Trump will be looking for the same after the GOP convention this week.

Republicans say the Democratic convention painted a dark picture about the state of the country. They say they will have a more optimistic message focused on American resiliency in the face of health and economic crises.

“Over the next four days President Trump and Republicans will talk about all we’ve achieved and cast an aspirational, forward looking vision of what will accomplish in the next four years,” McDaniel said.

What are people saying about the stage placement?

Biden, Warren, and Sanders will once again be center stage, but they will not be the only targets of the evening.

Buttigieg has surged in a number state and national polls recently, and has presented himself as a centrist alternative to Warren’s progressive ideas.

Warren and Buttigieg will likely go head-to-head on a number of issues, like health care. Biden could also see an opportunity to swipe at Buttigieg, who has established himself in the centrist lane.

What topics could come up?

Impeachment

The debate falls in the middle of a number of public hearings in House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Most of the candidates in the Democratic primary field back have thrown support behind impeachment.

Medicare for All

Health care has turned out to be the most consequential policy debate in the primary. Sanders and Warren have advocated to overhaul the current health care system in favor of Medicare for All. Biden and Buttigieg, on the other hand, have pushed for a moderate approach to improving the current health care system. Warren, who has faced a number of questions about the specifics of her health care plan, will likely face questions about it on Wednesday.

Sexual Misconduct

Warren, Sanders, Booker, and Harris signed onto a letter Tuesday calling on the DNC to make sure NBC and its parent company Comcast conduct an independent investigation into the network’s “toxic culture” amid a number of sexual assault allegations.

While it’s unclear whether this will come up on Wednesday evening, NBC and Comcast have been dealing with the fallout of allegations against former “Today” anchor, Matt Lauer Matthew (Matt) Todd LauerComcast shareholders reject proposals for outside sexual harassment investigation at NBC Ronan Farrow fires back at Matt Lauer 'shoddy journalism' accusation: 'Just wrong' Megyn Kelly calls independent Tara Reade interview the 'wave of the future' MORE.

The women's advocacy group UltraViolet pushed last month for the DNC to cancel the debate. The letter from the senators does not call for the debate to be canceled.

Jobs and the Economy

Read excerpts from the interview below.

Can you walk us through what you've learned in recent hearings about your concerns about a national mail-in ballot initiative?

Davis: Absolutely. ... This is an issue that we've been addressing since I took over on our Republican side to lead the House Administration Committee, which actually has jurisdictions over our nation's election system in the House of Representatives. We saw with H.R. 1, the new Democratic majority decided they wanted to push election reforms. Part of those election reforms were reforms to mail-in balloting, nationalizing ballot harvesting, a process that's already been corrupted and caused us to have to have a special election in North Carolina. These things are not part of COVID-19’s pandemic. This has been part of their agenda. And when you look at mail-in balloting, we first have to understand what they mean. Many Democrats mean that they want to mail a live ballot to every single registered voter. And at the same time as I've been in hearings throughout this country, many of my Democratic colleagues don't want our local election officials to be able to follow the law and remove voters from those voter rolls that aren’t registered there or don't live there anymore. That would mean millions more ballots being put out into the street, into mailboxes. That's something that I am against, and most Americans would be against it. It's OK if you want to request a vote by mail. I encourage that, that happens in my home state of Illinois. But we can't nationalize a process that even Secretary of State Kim Wyman from Washington state, whose state has only vote by mail. She said it would take upwards of 10 years to effectively implement her system again. So things have to take time. We don't want to have to wait for election results. And if Democrats are successful, by mailing ballots to every single registered voter even though they might not be legally registered there at that address anymore or legal to vote, that's a problem.

Clemons: So, you actually support mail-in ballots, but folks need to request them. Is that right?



Davis: Yeah, and the White House is not against mail-in balloting. What they're against — And it's tough to explain this in the limited amount of characters that Twitter allows — But we have the ability to come on shows like yours. Mail-in ballots are something that Republicans and Democrats agree on, but it's how you implement them. We, as Republicans — and I know, the White House agrees — we don't want to see live ballots mailed to people who should never be eligible to vote at that address and Democrats will say, “Well, that's not a problem.” Well, you know what? It is. I have another member of my House Admin. Committee, Barry Loudermilk, congressman from Georgia. One of his staffers moved to Maryland. He requested a ballot to vote in Georgia as he should and can do. He got that one, but then got two ballots mailed to him in the most recent Maryland election, made out to some other names because they're still on the voter rolls of that address that he now lives at. And he did the right thing and destroyed them. But that's a problem.

Clemons: Is there a proactive GOP response on that makes that clear that you support some level of mail-in ballots? Are you crafting a bill that gives states the support they need for mail-in balloting?

Davis: Well, we've crafted numerous pieces of legislation regarding mail-in balloting, outlawing the corrupted process of ballot harvesting that is still ravaging in states like California. We did a ballot harvesting report where I sent observers from the House Administration Committee out to California and we saw numerous instances of ballots just being thrown outside and outside the collection box with no one watching them. They could have been stolen, corrupted, added to, who knows? We saw them laying around the elections office to where anybody walking in could grab them. That's not maintaining the chain of custody of a ballot to make sure someone's vote counted. Those things we've introduced bills to address. But unfortunately, Steve, not everybody wants to talk about elections. Not everybody wants to talk about the details of election reforms. It's folks like you that allow us to do that. But to answer your original question, we've laid it out on our social media pages in media interviews before. But also, we're just trying to build that case that there are a majority of areas that we in Washington, Republicans and Democrats, have agreed on immensely. We have provided over $1 billion to our local election officials to address cybersecurity issues and other election issues. And you know what? None of us talk enough about the success in the cybersecurity side when it comes to elections that 2018 showed us. We didn't have one instance of foreign interference, and that's a good thing that shows we have been working together, investing billions to help this process.

Clemons: Illinois's numbers of coronavirus are coming down dramatically, which is not the case in a lot of the rest of the country. What are you folks getting right that others are not?

Davis: Well, Illinois, we have had a state home order still in place, minimal exceptions. And we've seen many areas, especially the areas that I represent, that have met for months, the metrics that our governor laid out to get to phase four which just started this Friday. So we're seeing an increase in cases nationwide in many areas due to a wide variety of reasons. One, we have more people being tested. We’re testing asymptomatic people, which we were not doing during the height of this crisis, the height of this pandemic. But time will tell. After we've seen thousands gather in the streets to protest, others gathering for other nefarious reasons. We're going to see our Fourth of July weekend. We still see in news reports, thousands gathering in places like Los Angeles, just yesterday, defying the orders that Gov. Newsom put forth. This is an issue we're going to still have to continue to fight. It concerns me, especially with the good economic news that we've seen just recently with millions of jobs even more so than expected, being added to our economy.

Clemons: What do you think can be done on the job front? Do you need to pump more money into the system?

Davis: I think that's going to be determined by the continued increase or continued decrease or a stabilization in cases. We've bent the curve from where we were when this pandemic initially started, but we can't talk about the need for a new stimulus unless we look back at the successes we've had. Without the investment in the PPP program to keep our mom and pop shops alive before they could get to a phase four and partially reopened in states like Illinois, where I represent, was a program that worked. If it didn't work, we would not have seen the historic job numbers that we just saw in the last few weeks. If we weren't investing in the local tax base, then we wouldn't have the ability to fund our local governments once this pandemic was over. So we did the right thing in a very bipartisan way. We still have hundreds of billions of dollars yet to go out to our hospitals and medical facilities as part of the original CARES Act legislation. So these issues have to be put into the debate and into context in the discussion of any future stimulus.

Clemons: Is the situation improving for rural hospitals? Is the money and resources there for medical support in rural areas?

Davis: Yes, we've already seen over $75 billion sent out to our hospitals, both rural and urban, and our medical facilities. You know, those clinics that are really essential when it comes to getting diagnostic procedures and access to primary care and even elective procedures, that's getting better, especially in states like Illinois. I successfully argued with our administration at the end of April to reopen our clinics, to reopen our hospitals for elective and diagnostic procedures, because what one person may determine is elective, another person may need that same procedure to survive, and we don't want to have a higher death rate for diseases we know how to treat once we come out of this pandemic, because people were either too scared or they didn't have access to basic medical care that could have easily addressed their problem that killed them or could have killed them. So we've seen success. But we've also seen and need that increased testing to be able to be sure that those coming in don't have the virus, and if there are any facilities in this nation Steve, that ought to be able to mitigate the risk of anyone coming in and getting COVID, it's our hospitals, it’s our clinics. My wife goes to work at a hospital every day and does everything she can to mitigate the risk of bringing COVID home or coming home to anyone in our community with it.

Clemons: Do you support looking at supply chains in a new way?



Davis: Absolutely, I support that. Steve, my former colleague and good friend John Delaney John DelaneyCoronavirus Report: The Hill's Steve Clemons interviews Rep. Rodney Davis Eurasia Group founder Ian Bremmer says Trump right on China but wrong on WHO; CDC issues new guidance for large gatherings The Hill's Coronavirus Report: Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas says country needs to rethink what 'policing' means; US cases surpass 2 million with no end to pandemic in sight MORE is absolutely right. John and I used to work together on infrastructure issues when we served together, actually trying to put together a national infrastructure bank that would have been able to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges and other infrastructure, even vertical infrastructure. We have to look at our supply chain and really, I think, as we move ahead, we ought to plan to invest federal dollars to partner with our manufacturers to really incentivize construction of facilities. I believe in many rural areas because we have the workforce, we have the space and we ought to be able to incentivize the placement of that supply chain need into our rural communities to make sure we don't rely upon China for PPE, when they cornered when they cornered the market on PPE before the rest of the world knew about the virus. We have to make sure that our defense industry is able to produce the needed materials here. It's time to bring them back home. Bring that supply chain back to North America. And it's especially telling today, with the full implementation of the USMCA, North America is the place where we should be.

Clemons: What would you say if you were to have a talk with the president or vice president or the coronavirus task force in the White House?

Davis: Guidance and advice. I know we're learning about a disease that no one on Earth knew existed a year ago. I know that advice is going to change, but when the advice continues to change without taking into consideration the advice that's already on the table, what is created is we have a bunch of masked vigilantes that you know don't follow the guidance or the advice that the CDC has already laid out, consistency matters. If Dr. Fauci, who I have the utmost respect for, is going to offer continued advice on when and where somebody should wear a mask. Then he's gonna have to follow the same guidelines, but it has to be consistent. Are we able to stand 6 feet or more away from somebody outside without a mask, as CDC says? Or do we have to wear a mask every time we're in public? That consistency matters because without it, people don't take any guidance seriously.",2020-07-02 15:21:18-04:00,

To mask or not to mask? By now, many Americans know to wear masks in public, especially in enclosed spaces. A new study by Britain’s Cambridge and Greenwich universities found communitywide use of face masks combined with social distancing could prevent second waves of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. (The Hill)

And, just in today, the CDC is now advising organizers of large gatherings to ‘strongly encourage’ the use of face coverings. Federal health officials on Friday urged organizers of large gatherings that involve shouting, chanting or singing to “strongly encourage” the use of cloth face coverings to lower the risk of spreading the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said its guidance does not directly apply to national protests against police brutality or the upcoming Republican National Convention, but said the guidelines speak for themselves.

THE HILL’S CORONAVIRUS REPORT



Welcome to The Hill's Coronavirus Report. It's Friday, June 12.





Editor’s Note.

Today, I had one of the most intriguing and mind-stretching interviews yet in my series for The Hill’s Coronavirus Report. Time magazine editor-at-large and Eurasia Group President and founder Ian Bremmer has a disruptive mind and frames things in ways that end up haunting me for a while. He said the U.S. and global economy may see stock markets fleetingly rise, but economies will not “really be back” until there is a vaccine. He described how this is America’s first depression since the Great Depression. And he argued there is absolutely no global leadership or coordination around the virus.

I asked him if America, given the president’s threat to deploy troops to U.S. cities to quell protests, was becoming more like China, when for decades people had been hoping China would become more like the U.S. Bremmer argued that Washington, with the help of Silicon Valley, is becoming more like Beijing because so much of the U.S. tech sector has become less about communications and more about surveillance. But when it comes to U.S.-China relations, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the pandemic, Bremmer said, “Trump is absolutely right in his critique on China and absolutely wrong in his take on the WHO.”

He went on to say that we need to rethink the international order — and that today, we would not create a NATO, WTO or U.N. Security Council — at least not in the way they exist now. He also said there was a major global economic crisis brewing “that no one is paying attention to.” He said that there is enormous vulnerability of middle-income markets and that a major market collapse of these countries, akin to what happened to developing countries in the 1980s could unfold, creating global contagion.

I share all of this because global systems, when they flinch or change course, create staggeringly broad and sometimes unforeseen changes. I liked Bremmer’s comments for linking what few others are talking about. There are shocks out there that aren’t being considered fully — and his thoughts give us a way to think about some of the systemic impacts COVID-19 has unleashed or sped up.

Twitter said it had discovered and removed 23,750 accounts that were “highly engaged” in a coordinated effort to spread misinformation, and 150,000 others that were dedicated to amplifying China’s messages through likes and retweets.

ISSUES, CAUSES, PASSIONS





America's mental health is under siege — Congress can help now. For years now, the American psyche has been under siege. Well before COVID-19 arrived, the U.S. suicide rate was the highest it had been since World War II and drug overdoses were killing more people than car accidents. Now, though, we must also contend with a deadly virus, the worst unemployment since the Great Depression and isolating lockdown measures, as well as the national trauma of George Floyd’s horrific death at the hands of police. (Brian Barnett, Andrew Carlo and Bruce Schwartz for The Hill)



An intelligence perspective: Stop predicting and start “living the questions.” In the face of disruptions that are not likely but very consequential, it is tempting — but mistaken — to try to predict the future. Rather, the challenge is to seize the opportunity, to “live the questions,” as Rainer Maria Rilke put it in “Letters to a Young Poet.” (Gregory F. Treverton for The Hill)

THE HILL’S CORONAVIRUS REPORT



Welcome to The Hill's Coronavirus Report. It's Thursday, June 11.





Editor’s Note.

Today in my anchor interview for The Hill’s Coronavirus Report, I asked Kansas City, Mo., Mayor Quinton Lucas to reflect on the stresses simultaneously hitting his residents: paralyzed businesses slowly becoming alive again, unemployed workers, the erupting anger over the death of George Floyd and police brutality, and the ongoing COVID-19 health challenges. Just last week, his city found more than 200 people from a single paper-making plant infected with the coronavirus. Lucas jumped on how many were missing the point in the protests and the calls to defund police.

""Rather than just talking about what defunding the police may mean,” he said, “let's actually talk about what it is that we want to proactively fund and support, right? We shouldn't actually just build things from a negative, and I think I have some fear right now that that's the social moment we're in.

“Instead, what we need to say is, ‘Well, how do we actually make sure we have good, strong, sustained investments in mental health? How do we make sure we have sustained investments and alternatives to incarceration? How do we make sure that we at least modify, remove, eliminate the war on drugs in our country, which in many ways has been an abject failure?’ ”

America’s deck has been stacked against communities of color which are being felled disproportionately by the COVID-19 virus. There are much higher infection and mortality rates in these communities than in the white community. What is clear is that the virus has a number of vectors — and part of the story, as Rep. Val Demings Valdez (Val) Venita DemingsDemings on Florida: 'We're excited about what we're seeing' but 'taking absolutely nothing for granted' Why it's time for a majority female Cabinet Sunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day MORE (D-Fla.) told me recently, is that racism is itself a virus plaguing us. To fight the racism virus, Lucas suggests some solid strategies — invest much more deeply in mental health services, find alternatives to incarceration where so many black and brown Americans are behind bars and stop a war on drugs that has created so much of the dysfunction in our jails and society.

These sorts of initiatives fighting for fair and just public health on a different track may be as important, if not more so, than the annual shot or pill we are all eventually going to have to take to fight off the yearly assault of COVID-19. Something to think about.

ISSUES, CAUSES, PASSIONS





America's role in world affairs may never recover from COVID-19. The failure of the Trump administration to even participate, let alone take the lead, in global efforts to devise a coordinated response to the most significant global health challenge in a century has made it clear to other nations that they cannot depend on U.S. leadership in a crisis. It will have lasting consequences for America’s role in world affairs. (Barry M. Blechman for The Hill)

Support for cities is essential to the national economic recovery. A nationwide economic recovery without the federal government working hand-in-hand with state and local governments will be no recovery at all. We urge members of Congress to show the political courage we need right now to ensure that America’s cities, towns and villages continue to be part of the solution. Let’s get our country back to work. (Clearfield, Utah, Mayor Mark Shepherd for The Hill)

Dying to connect or dying unconnected: Two realities of the COVID-19 pandemic. The desire to connect with others is a need we all share. Our ability to connect with others on our timing and choosing is something that we should not take for granted. This may not be the case for those who are alone battling the coronavirus.

Sunday shows preview: Protests continue over shooting of Blake; coronavirus legislation talks remain at impasse,"The protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., along with the ongoing standstill over the next coronavirus stimulus package are expected to dominate the Sunday talk show circuit this weekend.

Blake was shot by a Kenosha police officer seven times and tased twice on Sunday, leaving him partially paralyzed. Police have identified three officers involved in the shooting earlier this week.

On Tuesday night, two protesters were shot and killed and another was injured. Officials later arrested Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Illinois, who faces multiple homicide charges.

Blake’s family attorney, Ben Crump, has said there is a disparity in how police treated Rittenhouse versus how they treated Blake. Crump is booked on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.

Pelosi spars with CNN's Blitzer over COVID-19 aid: 'You really don't know what you're talking about',"Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided? Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.) on Tuesday defended holding out for a more expansive COVID-19 economic relief package than the current proposal offered by the Trump administration in an unusually contentious interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, telling the news anchor that ""you really don't know what you're talking about"" and calling him an ""apologist"" for Republicans.

Pelosi and the Trump administration have been trying to negotiate a pandemic relief package for months to no avail, with Democrats currently pushing for a price tag of $2.2 trillion — down from their initial proposal of $3.4 trillion this spring — and the Trump administration most recently offering a $1.8 trillion proposal.

Blitzer asked Pelosi to respond to a tweet from progressive Rep. Ro Khanna Rohit (Ro) KhannaReestablishing American prosperity by investing in the 'Badger Belt' House Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education Biden says he opposes Supreme Court term limits MORE (D-Calif.) earlier this week urging Democrats to consider the White House's latest offer and ""make a deal & put the ball in [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell's [R-Ky.] court"" because ""people in need can't wait until February.""

""What I say to you is, I don't know why you're always an apologist and many of your colleagues are apologists for the Republican position,"" Pelosi replied.

ADVERTISEMENT

""Ro Khanna, that's nice. That isn't what we're going to do. And nobody's waiting until February. I want this very much now because people need help now. But it's no use giving them a false thing just because the president wants to put a check with his name on it in the mail,"" she said.

""Andrew Yang Andrew YangPelosi spars with CNN's Blitzer over COVID-19 aid: 'You really don't know what you're talking about' The shape of guaranteed income Biden's latest small business outreach is just ... awful MORE, he's lovely. Ro Khanna, he's lovely. They are not negotiating this situation. They have no idea of the particulars,"" she added.

Blitzer then asked Pelosi why she wouldn't call Trump directly and try to work out a deal. Pelosi and Trump haven't spoken directly in almost a year, but the Speaker has been holding frequent talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinDemocrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Trump, Biden set for weekend swing state sprint Mnuchin says he learned of Pelosi's letter to him about stimulus talks 'in the press' MORE in recent days.

""What makes me amused, if it weren't so sad, is how you all think that you know more about the suffering of the American people than those of us who are elected by them to represent them at that table,"" Pelosi said.

ADVERTISEMENT

In addition to Khanna and Yang, moderate Democrats in the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus have also been vocal in recent weeks about urging leaders to reach a deal to help Americans in need because of circumstances arising from the pandemic. Blitzer then asked if there was reluctance to make a deal to ""not allow the president to take credit if there's a deal.""

""I don't care about that,"" Pelosi told Blitzer. ""With all due respect, and you know we've known each other a long time, you really don't know what you're talking about.""

""Yes, there's some people who said this or that. Overwhelmingly, my caucus wants what is right for the American people,"" she continued.

Blitzer later moved to end the interview, saying, ""These are incredibly difficult times right now, and we'll leave it on that note.""

""You are not right on this, Wolf. And I hate to say that. But I feel confident about it, and I feel confident about my colleagues, and I feel confidence in my [committee] chairs,"" Pelosi said.

""It's not about me. It's about millions of Americans who can't put food on the table, who can't pay the rent,"" Blitzer began.

""And we represent them,"" Pelosi interjected. ""We know them. We represent them.""

Blitzer again tried to wrap up the interview and thanked Pelosi for coming on his show, but then she said, ""Thank you for your sensitivity to our constituents' needs.""

""I am sensitive to them,because I see them on the street begging for food, begging for money,"" Blitzer said.

""Have you fed them? We feed them,"" Pelosi replied.

""We'll continue this conversation down the road for sure,"" Blitzer said before cutting to a commercial break.

Pelosi similarly argued during a House Democratic Caucus call earlier Tuesday that Trump's pleas for Congress to ""go big"" on a stimulus package give her leverage to hold out for a bigger bill.

ADVERTISEMENT

""I appreciate the, shall we say, a couple people saying, ‘Take it, take it, take it,’"" Pelosi said, according to a source on the call. ""Take it? Take it? Even the president is saying, ‘Go big or go home.’""

Trump has repeatedly shifted positions on a coronavirus aid package in the last week. A week ago, he declared that the talks were off and urged Senate Republicans to focus on confirming his nominee to the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett. Hours later, he reversed course and called for standalone measures to provide stimulus checks as well as funding for airlines and small businesses.

On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted, ""STIMULUS! Go big or go home!!!""

That ran counter to Senate Republicans, who indicated on Tuesday that they plan to vote next week on a ""targeted"" relief measure that would authorize about $500 billion in spending.",2020-10-13 18:52:04-04:00,

Unite the Country, the super PAC supporting Biden’s presidential bid, and the liberal group American Bridge said they would form a partnership to raise and spend a nine-figure amount supporting the former vice president’s effort to oust Trump.

“To beat Donald Trump, it is going to take everyone working together to spend every dollar smartly and strategically,” Steve Schale, the CEO of Unite the Country, said in a statement. “We are proud to partner with American Bridge and other groups to promote the candidacy of Joe Biden, who we know will unite our country and restore decency and moral clarity.”

The partnership means that the two groups will coordinate polling and research efforts, as well as message testing and ad buys. It will focus heavily on outreach to so-called Democratic base groups, including suburban women and organized labor.

The partnership is illustrative of how Democratic groups are rallying behind Biden as they look to pivot toward a general election campaign against Trump. It also suggests that outside groups are trying to coordinate resources to avoid conflicting messages and competing political efforts.

“The smartest campaign efforts pool resources and align on strategy,” Granholm said. “This partnership follows that winning model and creates a much-needed hub for donors and like-minded organizations to collaborate.”

GOP coronavirus bill blocked as deal remains elusive,"Senate Democrats blocked a scaled-down, GOP-only $500 billion coronavirus bill Wednesday, as talks continue on a bipartisan deal between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided? Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.) and the White House.

Senators voted 51-44 to end debate on the Republican proposal, falling short of the 60 needed to overcome the procedural hurdle.

The GOP bill was widely expected to fall short—and is less than a third of the latest offer made by the White House. But Senate Republican leadership was eager to force Democrats to go on the record on coronavirus relief as the number of cases per day is on the rise and the November election is less than two weeks away.

“The overwhelming bulk of it is programs that Democrats claim they support. Well, it turns out there’s a special perk to being a United States senator. When you actually support something, you get to vote for it. ... When you actually want an outcome, you vote it. Strangely enough, that’s not what seems to be happening,” McConnell said on Wednesday ahead of the vote.

The GOP bill included a federal unemployment benefit, another round of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) small business aid, more than $100 billion for schools and new funding for coronavirus testing and vaccine research and distribution.

Democrats blasted the GOP bill as a “stunt,” aimed at allowing vulnerable GOP senators to vote for a bill as they fight to hold onto the majority in November.

“The Republican majority will bring up a bill designed to fail. Their partisan, emaciated COVID relief bill. ... The bill we’re voting on today has already failed in the Senate, didn’t get a Democratic vote and we already know it lacks the votes,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerDemocrats on edge as Biden-Trump fight nears end Reestablishing American prosperity by investing in the 'Badger Belt' House Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education MORE (D-N.Y.).

“The closer we get to an election, the sillier it gets here in Leader McConnell’s Senate. ... It’s hard to believe that this is supposedly the greatest debate chamber in the country or in the world. Leader McConnell moves to table his own bill so Republicans could then vote against tabling it,” Schumer added.

But no Democratic senators supported the GOP bill on Wednesday.

The floor drama in the Senate comes as talks are ongoing between Pelosi and the administration aimed at getting a deal on a significantly larger coronavirus bill.

The two sides are discussing a package between $1.8 trillion to $2.2 trillion, though President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE has signaled he is willing to go higher in order to cut a deal with Pelosi after months of stop-and-start negotiations.

Meadows said that the discussions had entered a “new phase” as the White House and Democratic negotiators wrangle over language of a potential bill, though he noted that the two sides remain apart on the price tag. Meadows cited state and local assistance as the primary source of disagreement.

“I can tell you that the negotiations have entered a new phase, which is more on the technical side of trying to get the language right if we can agree upon the numbers,” Meadows said. “We are still apart, still a number of issues to work on, but the last 24 hours have moved the ball down the field.""

Pelosi, during an MSNBC interview Wednesday, also appeared optimistic about the chances of a deal, though she hasn’t said if she believes that will take place before the Nov. 3 election.

""I’m pretty happy. I think we have a prospect for an agreement,” Pelosi said. “[I]’m optimistic, because even with what Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE says — we don't want to do it before the election — but let's keep working so that we can do it after the election.”

But an agreement between Pelosi and the White House faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where Senate Republicans are cool to passing another deal.

He told reporters Wednesday that he could not get 13 votes for a $2.4 trillion deal.

McConnell told GOP senators during a closed-door lunch Tuesday that he warned the White House against cutting a deal before the election. But in a press conference Tuesday, McConnell said the Senate would take up an agreement, if it is reached, “at some point” but didn’t commit to if it would be before or after Nov. 3.

The Smithfield Foods plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., was the site of a coronavirus outbreak in April. At least 1,294 Smithfield workers contracted the coronavirus, and four employees died from it.

CDC workers visited the plant that month and provided recommendations to reduce disease transmission. The Democrats claim that the recommendations were later withdrawn, watered down and then a final version was released.

The Democrats requested Scalia provide copies of all communications between the Labor Department and the CDC or Agriculture Department regarding a site visit to Smithfield.

The letter to request this information from Scalia follows CDC Director Robert Redfield last week telling Baldwin that his office was in contact with the Agriculture Department and Labor Department about the Smithfield outbreak.

Baldwin asked Redfield about these recommendations in a HELP Committee hearing last month and Redfield said at the time he had no contact with the Agriculture Department, White House or Smithfield on the matter.

The senators also requested copies of communications between Smithfield and the Labor Department, copies of reports of the in-person visit, a list of all versions of the visit memo, and copies of communications between the Labor Department and any other federal agency on the visit.",2020-10-07 12:57:58-04:00,
Coronavirus Report: The Hill's Steve Clemons interviews Rep. Lauren Underwood,"Steve Clemons: Today we have a special edition of the Coronavirus Report that builds off of the highly successful, content rich, if I do say so myself, national virtual online summit titled “Health Reimagined” presented by The Hill a few days ago. The discussions were so good we wanted to make sure you had a chance to hear them, particularly this one, this conversation with U.S. House of Representatives member Lauren Underwood Lauren UnderwoodDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts Is there a nurse in the 'House'? Hillicon Valley: Congressional antitrust report rips tech firms | Facebook tightens ban on QAnon content | Social media groups urged to weed out disinformation targeting minority voters MORE.

[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] Director [Robert] Redfield and you know, he put it right out there and he said, “Look, this you know, every crisis creates an opportunity, and maybe we need to get some of the wrongs that we've had embedded in our society — systemic racism, inequality, people being left out — and maybe use this as an opportunity.” And I'm interested in what you thought of what he said and what can be done.

Lauren Underwood: Well, I think that a focus on co-morbidities and other issues that people might have as preexisting conditions is relevant when we're talking about maybe disparities in death rates, but what we also see a significant disparities in infection rates, and so that extends beyond social determinants of health. I'm really glad that that is part of their conversation here and that they've elevated the long-standing career staff that have been, longtime, working on racial and ethnic health disparities at the CDC, this health equity officer that he's talking about. However, we do know that communities of color are often essential workers, they’re front-line workers. They don't have an option to stay at home or work from home, and that they are sacrificing, potentially, their own health and well-being and that of their families in order to serve their communities in their essential jobs. And so, you know, I think that this is a systemic problem within our health care system and that we're gonna have to wrap our arms around this issue in order to have a comprehensive solution. And I have not seen a comprehensive solution to date from this administration.

Clemons: I think that Dr. Redfield was also saying he — there’s sort of an absence of strategy in a lot of places. But you know, you have the insights of being a nurse. You've been out there. Lena Wen is gonna be on later and say, “Hey, people in that field and profession know they're putting themselves on the line. They know that there are risks for being out there.” But isn't there a part of the social contract where we need to do more than we're doing? And when you have colleagues in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, do they come to you and ask, “Hey, what aren't we doing that we should be doing?”

Underwood: That's right. So, it's not part of the social contract to ask a nurse to wear a soiled, contaminated N95 mask day after day after day. That is not the social contract. And so when we talk about the sacrifices that we are asking our health care workers to make, we cannot be sacrificing clinical norms and standards of high-quality care just because we're in a pandemic. I mean, the United States has been battling COVID-19 for four months now, and we could have jump-started our domestic manufacturing capacity, but the president, decided not to fully activate his authorities under the Defense Production Act. And so as we enter and continue through this phase of resurging cases across the country – I mean, I'm seeing headlines in newspapers saying, “Oh, no, we're in this place again with not enough PPE, we’re in this place again where we don't have the satisfactory equipment or the number of hospital beds” or whatever other issue. And so I think that we have a real problem right now in this response and that is not part of the social contract.

Clemons: What else do you think Congress needs to be doing that it is not doing? Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided? Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE has, and I'm sure you're part of it, a next wave, the 3 trillion dollar CARES Act, dealing with other things that were undone. But is there something between that? Because everyone is saying, “Well, that's not gonna fly in the Senate.” What is the next piece of doable legislation and doable support for the country that you think we need?

Underwood: So in the HEROES Act, we call for free coronavirus treatment, and that is so critically important because in this time of COVID-19 we know that there are so many people who are symptomatic who are delaying getting tested and certainly avoiding seeking treatment because they know that they cannot afford a week in an ICU. They know that they cannot afford to pay for being on a ventilator. And that has been a real barrier to people being able to get control of the virus and its spread throughout the community. We know at baseline the American people have been cutting their pills in half. At baseline, they've been tapering their insulin because it's just too expensive. And so the Congress has been trying to address those issues. But during the time of the pandemic, there's an additional sense of urgency. And so that is why it is so very important, so very important that we take the opportunity to extend free coronavirus treatment to everybody in this country.

Clemons: How is your district looking at Washington right now, your constituents? Do they think this is all Keystone Cops, or do they look at Washington for helping to support them? I'm just interested in the field with people you talk to, and they look to you and they look at what's going on here. Do they think they're getting what they should be getting?

Underwood: Well, there are certainly problems. And rolling out the Paycheck Protection Program that there are still unmet needs among are small-business owners. The looming threat of the unemployment benefits expiring at the end of this month has certainly been a real challenge for folks. And I would say that there's a huge segment of our community, younger people, recent graduates that are looking for student debt relief. And that is something that when we think about this economic crisis that COVID has jump-started, we really have to deal with the full range of economic issues. So it's not just housing. It's not just paycheck to paycheck, but it's looking at the entire financial situation of the American people and making sure that we're at least stabilizing so that we don't see hundreds and thousands of Americans thrown into financial distress that no amount of cash infusion into the Fed would be able to address.

Clemons: We have a question — we've been taking some questions from the field. We've got a great one for you that I would like the post from Jill. Jill?

Jill Alloman: Hi. My name is Jill Alloman. I'm a certified nurse midwife. I work as faculty at Frontier Nursing University in Kentucky. I also worked with the American Association of Birth Centers. My question is for Rep. Underwood. How can we reduce the racial and economic disparities that impact maternal and infant health so seriously, especially when much of the current health focus is on the pandemic? Thank you.

Clemons: Such a big question, maternal and infant health. And I just want to share with the audience that the rates of difference when you look across racial lines are staggeringly horrible. And so, your thoughts on that?

Underwood: Yes, thank you, Jill, for the question. So, as the pandemic was coming into the effect here in the United States, we were preparing to introduce something called the Black Maternal Health “Momnibus” Act and the Black Maternal Health Caucus that I co-founded with Congresswoman Alma Adams Alma Shealey AdamsFrom HBCUs to Capitol Hill: How Congress can play an important role Democrats demand answers from Labor Department on CDC recommendations for meatpacking plant Coronavirus Report: The Hill's Steve Clemons interviews Rep. Lauren Underwood MORE in April of 2019. And so the Momnibus Act, actually introduced in March, is a comprehensive set of legislation to address this long term disparity that black women are three to four times more likely to die as a result of childbirth in this country. We're tackling workforce issues, data collection issues, mental health, the experiences of incarcerated women and women veterans, right, looking at the social determinants of health that we heard Dr. Redfield mention and apply them specifically to these maternal health disparities, supporting the community groups that have been, long term, involved in this issue. And so this is really a comprehensive bill. We have some bipartisan support, and we're really just excited about this national conversation that's happening around saving moms’ lives. But there's no time like the present. COVID-19 has certainly impacted maternal health in this country. The CDC actually put out a report in June that said that Black and Latinx women are more likely to have severe COVID illness when they are pregnant, and that is something that is extremely alarming. And so when we think about these disparities we have to have a wide-angle-lens focus, and this Momnibus Act would allow us to tackle many of those issues.

Clemons: Thank you so much. Congresswoman, I'm gonna ask you real quick one last question, because it's been on my mind. You used to work with the Department of Health and Human Services, you know this field really well. I don't know if you heard my discussion with Secretary Alex Azar earlier, but I asked him about their efforts to replace ObamaCare and whether there was anything real there and you know he shared that he thought there was. ... And I asked him about, well, you know, a lot of people worry about pre-existing conditions and where the Trump administration is on that, and he says, “We’re absolutely, absolutely mandating that preexisting conditions remain covered,” that we're absolutely committed to it. This is the Trump administration, and I just want to ask you, do you believe him? And do you believe that?

Underwood: I absolutely do not believe it, but I think it's a very nice sentiment. In the meantime, we just passed a bill, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act, last week on June 29. The first ACA enhancement bill that has passed in 10 years. Listen, congressional Republicans had four terms since the ACA was signed into law to make the improvements that they thought. Instead, they tried to repeal and diminish and tear down these critical health protections that hundreds of millions of Americans rely on every year. And so guess what? We stepped up big time, and we're working to lower premium prices, expand coverage, expand Medicaid and make sure that the American people are truly protected.

Clemons: I want to thank you so much. I just want to acknowledge, you sound great. Your picture froze, so we put a little bit more on me, photo-wise, than the congresswoman. But that's why — but I want to thank you so much. I hope we can have you back because I know there's a lot we need to discuss. And I really appreciate your perspective here today.",2020-07-24 15:21:06-04:00,
Anxious Democrats amp up pressure for vote on COVID-19 aid,"House Democrats, increasingly anxious about leaving Washington without acting on coronavirus relief, are amping up the pressure on Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided?

Pelosi has held firm that she will not lower her demand for a $2.2 trillion package, but a growing number of uneasy centrists are clamoring to vote on some new stimulus legislation — even without a deal — before Oct. 2, when the House is scheduled to recess for the final leg of campaigning ahead of the Nov. 3 elections.

The pressure is emerging in different forms.

Moderate Democrats have taken the remarkable step of threatening to endorse a Republican effort to force a floor vote on a single provision of the relief blueprint — help for small businesses — even against the wishes of their own leadership.

The Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of centrist lawmakers, continued this week to press leaders in both parties to act immediately on a package topping $1.5 trillion.

“I think we ought to be taking up COVID-19 legislation before we leave here, and I don't think we ought to wait,” Hoyer said. “People are really hurting.”

Complicating the debate for the Democrats, rank-and-file lawmakers have been all over the board when it comes to specific strategies for pressuring Republicans to return to the negotiating table — and providing themselves political cover as they return home to voters crushed by the health and economic devastation caused by the deadly pandemic.

Some lawmakers want a vote on a massive package topping $3 trillion, akin to the HEROES Act, which the House passed in May.

“It will have to continue to slide to the point where they feel they are in serious danger of losing the Senate,” Ocasio-Cortez told The Hill.

Senate Republicans had countered the Democrats’ offer with a $1.1 trillion proposal, but subsequently moved a much smaller $650 bill to the Senate floor. Democrats mocked the legislation as woefully insufficient — Schumer called it “emaciated” — and they voted unanimously to sink it.

That’s led to speculation that an agreement on coronavirus relief will be even tougher to reach than it was before.

Still, Pelosi said Thursday that she’s hopeful the negotiations with Republicans will resume “soon,” adding that Democrats will be “very soon” unveiling the details of their spending package.

“I'm eager to hear what [the White House negotiators] have to say when they come,” she told reporters in the Capitol.

Unlike the government funding bill, the coronavirus stimulus has no real deadline; rather, it’s been the severity of the impact on health and the economy that’s driven Congress to act on four previous rounds of emergency relief. But there is an exception: the airlines are set to run out of emergency funding at the end of the month, and major airline companies are poised to furlough tens of thousands of employees the following day.

“Sept. 30 is fraught with meaning for them,” Pelosi said Thursday.

Rep. Peter DeFazio Peter Anthony DeFazioDemocrats, GOP fighting over largest House battlefield in a decade Trump says talks on COVID-19 aid are now 'working out' Trump gambles with new stimulus strategy MORE (D-Ore.), who heads the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said he remains hopeful a deal is still possible before then.

“I have agreement with my leadership that it would be a part of a package — if we get a package,” he said.

The parties cleared one major obstacle on Tuesday, when they struck a deal on legislation to fund the government beyond September, likely avoiding a shutdown. In a subsequent letter to House Democrats, Pelosi said she was able to secure that agreement because Democrats stuck together through the talks. She asked for similar unity amid the coronavirus negotiations, suggesting yet again that she’s holding out for a deal.

“Our unity served us well yesterday,” she wrote Wednesday, referring to the government funding deal. “Our unity will again serve us well in the ongoing COVID-19 relief efforts.”

That message is sure to disappoint the moderates fighting to secure the Speaker’s commitment to a vote on some form of stimulus before Congress recesses for the elections. But veterans of Capitol Hill said they’re confident Pelosi will find a way to bring the various factions together in the coming days — and ultimately win the bipartisan deal they all agree on.

“I don't know if we can get one before Oct. 2 — certainly every effort is gonna be made to do so,” said Larson. “But I've watched her [Pelosi] long enough to know that she's determined to keep us here — albeit subject to the call — until we do.

“She's not going to go softly into the night.”",2020-09-24 12:59:56-04:00,

THE HILL’S CORONAVIRUS REPORT



Welcome to The Hill's Coronavirus Report. It's Thursday, July 30.





Editor’s Note.

This comparison will not be comfortable for some, but given the zoonotic transmission of SARS-Cov-2 to humans, it’s important to remember that what distinguishes humans from animals is the ability to make informed choices and to control one’s environment, at least for many people. Before COVID-19 hit, I remember reading about African swine fever last October after it had decimated the Chinese pig population, killing more than 300 million swine.

I remember thinking at that time that pigs didn’t have the behavioral choice not to birth enormous litters of piglets and didn’t have the ability to be separated from each other in the way they are held in pens. I thought that it’s a good thing that if a virus jumped from animals to humans, at least people were not confined in the same way and could adjust behavior, be rational in ways that stop the spread of the virus. But then there is Rep. Louie Gohmert Louis (Louie) Buller GohmertGeorgia Republican Drew Ferguson tests positive for COVID-19 Michigan Republican isolating after positive coronavirus test GOP Rep. Mike Bost tests positive for COVID-19 MORE (R-Texas) who refused to wear a mask and change his behavior. He has tested positive for COVID-19.

I think that the question for those who have politicized mask-wearing and who have engaged in what looks like a cult-like obsession with hydroxychloroquine — which the Food and Drug Administration has said does not work and was found to be a killer of people with certain heart conditions in Brazil — is, what separates the hydroxychloroquine crowd from animals who don’t know how to change their behavior, or who can’t? We clearly have the right to question guidance from the government. That is part of critical thinking, but the dogma that has taken over regarding masks or certain favored drugs is not part of enlightened choices informed by science and empiricism.

People like to gather. I do too. But these behaviors — kids going to school, folks attending church, people working on manufacturing assembly lines or going to the beach, and so many other activities where people are jammed near each other — need to be embedded with smart health safeguards. Meanwhile, Gohmert blames the mask, not himself.

We need to do better. That’s the lesson I derived from reading about African swine fever last fall.

The Hill's Campaign Report: Democrats break fundraising records in Senate races,"Welcome to The Hill’s Campaign Report, your daily rundown on all the latest news in the 2020 presidential, Senate and House races. Did someone forward this to you? Click here to subscribe.

We’re Julia Manchester, Max Greenwood and Jonathan Easley. Here’s what we’re watching today on the campaign trail:

ADVERTISEMENT

LEADING THE DAY:

Democrats in the most competitive Senate races pulled in campaign cash at historic levels in the third quarter of 2020. Not just one, but two candidates shattered the quarterly record previously set in 2018 by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) during his much-hyped (but ultimately unsuccessful) bid to oust Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzIt's time for a universal charitable deduction Twitter changes policy, unlocks New York Post account after standoff The Memo: Texas could deliver political earthquake MORE (R-Texas).

Filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) posted on Thursday show the extent to which Democratic Senate challengers have overwhelmed their GOP opponents in the money race. We looked at 13 races in 12 states where Democrats are running for seats currently held by Republicans: Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. Democrats outraised their rivals in each of those races in the third quarter of the year, while Republicans on average burned through their campaign cash at a much faster rate. Here’s a look at some of the numbers:

A friendly reminder that fundraising doesn’t necessarily translate to victory. Just take a look at O’Rourke’s 2018 Senate run. Amy McGrath may have raised nearly $37 million in the third quarter, but she’s still facing strong headwinds in her bid against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.). And while Jaime Harrison raised a record-shattering $57 million and has largely closed his polling gap with Sen.

Nevertheless, the Q3 fundraising hauls add to the monstrous wave of cash that has washed over Democrats this cycle. The party’s candidates and left-leaning groups raised nearly $1.5 billion through ActBlue, the Democratic online fundraising clearinghouse, over the past three months. And just this week, former Vice President Biden announced that his campaign and affiliated groups had raised $383 million in September alone, besting President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s $248 million haul for the month.

POLLING UPDATE:

Exclusive polling for you here from The Hill-Harris — Biden leads Trump in Pennsylvania and Michigan, but Florida is a toss-up heading into the homestretch.

Biden has built up a double-digit lead in Michigan, which Trump won narrowly in 2016. The race is closer in Pennsylvania, where Biden is ahead by 5 points. In Florida, which is always close, the candidates are knotted at 48 percent a piece.

The poll reveals some interesting dynamics that could shape the outcome on Nov. 3

The coronavirus is the top issue in all three states and voters believe Biden is better equipped to lead on the pandemic going forward. A majority of voters believe the economy is headed in the wrong direction, but it’s still a winning issue for Trump, albeit by smaller margins than he’s had in the past.

Biden is performing better than expected among seniors, independents and suburban voters. All of those groups broke for Trump in 2016.

But the intensity of support remains an advantage for Trump. Many of Biden’s supporters say they’re backing him because they oppose Trump, not because they want to cast a ballot for the Democratic nominee.

Get the full story HERE.

And we received some internal polling in a Pennsylvania swing district.

A survey conducted by Jamestown Associates on behalf of Republican Jim Bognet’s campaign finds him running close to Rep. Matt Cartwright Matthew (Matt) Alton CartwrightThe Hill's Campaign Report: Democrats break fundraising records in Senate races Races heat up for House leadership posts Trump Jr. seeks to elect 'new blood' to Republican Party MORE (D-Penn.).

Cartwright is at 48 percent and Bognet is at 43, with 9 percent undecided. The poll has a 4 percentage point margin of error.

Bognet is viewed favorably by 34 percent, compared to 40 percent who view him unfavorably. Cartwright posts a positive 45-39 split.

The presidential ballot shows Biden with a narrow lead in the district, 48 to 46. Trump won the district by 10 points in 2016 but it swung to Democrats in 2018.

Fifty-one percent of voters say they believe their neighbors are voting for Trump. That’s one metric that some pollsters have used to try to smoke out so-called “shy” Trump voters, who are embarrassed to tell pollsters they support the president.

Cartwright’s campaign and the House Majority PAC have heavily outspent Bognet in the race, but Bognet’s campaign is hoping independents, who view him favorably by a 36-32 margin, will break his way on Election Day.

THE REVIEWS ARE IN

Viewers are shelling out praise for NBC anchor Savannah Guthrie after she moderated last night’s presidential town hall with Trump.

NBC faced criticism earlier this week for airing the town hall which aired at the same time as Biden’s ABC town hall, forcing many viewers to pick between the two.

But a number of critics are saying they were pleased with Guthrie’s performance, citing her ability to press the president on a number of topics including the coronavirus.

At one point, the “Today” anchor even confronted Trump on his retweet of a post espousing a conspiracy theory about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, telling the president that he is not someone's ""crazy uncle"" who can retweet anything.

However, not everyone was impressed with the network’s town hall. Trump’s supporters said Guthrie was too hard on the president and did not leave enough time for voter questions during the forum.

Biden’s town hall, on the other hand was seen as a more low-key event, with Biden getting more time in his 90 minutes to answer questions from voters.

Early ratings show that Biden’s town hall led Trump’s in terms of viewership. Biden drew 12.7 million viewers compared with Trump’s 10.4 million. Final viewership tallies will be available later Friday, which will include numbers from NBC simulcasts on CNBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.

“[We’re getting] this new blood that’s not establishment, people coming into this for the right reasons with good stories who want to fight and are not afraid to actually be a conservative,” Trump Jr. said, sitting at the end of a long wooden table in the ornate townhouse on the first floor of his father’s Washington hotel.

The Trump hotel, which is usually a nerve center for administration and campaign insiders, was moving at a slower pace on Tuesday amid the coronavirus pandemic and the GOP convention.

Trump Jr. was dressed down in a pink button-down shirt and dark jeans. He wore a black mask as he walked around the first floor of the hotel to mingle with friends and aides, including former U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell Richard GrenellHunter Biden questions are too important for the media to dismiss Trump leans into attacks on Biden's family, business dealings Trump expected to bring Hunter Biden's former business partner to debate MORE.

Behind the scenes, Trump Jr. has been fundraising, recording robocalls, cutting radio ads and filming iPhone and Facebook videos for his endorsed candidates. Several of them will be featured at the Republican National Convention this week.

Sean Parnell, the Army Ranger who talked about his 485 days in battle on the Afghan-Pakistan border at the convention on Monday night, is challenging Rep. Conor Lamb (D) in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, a pivot seat that swung from President Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016.

Skarlatos is the former National Guardsman who helped stop a gunman on a train bound for Paris in 2015.

“There are plenty of people we’ve seen over the past four years, where it’s like, with friends like these, who needs Republicans? You basically have Democrats,” Trump Jr. said. “But there are so many who have started getting it … I like seeing that because there’s a lot of new personality coming into the party willing to engage and play the way the Democrats have played for decades.”

The Hill asked Trump Jr. if he believes Cheney should have a leadership role in the next Congress.

“It’s just very different, where the Republican Party is going,” he responded. “We’re still the party of endless wars and there are still some neo-cons who are really into that and we are not. My father is not … I just think that mentality is really out of place in the Republican Party right now but there are going to be those dinosaurs who do not evolve.”

Trump Jr. addressed the QAnon conspiracy theory, which has become a headache for GOP House leaders who have had to contend with recent primary victories by Republican candidates that have either embraced the theory or made other controversial and bigoted remarks.

Trump Jr. rejected QAnon but he bristled at the question, saying the media is giving it oxygen as part of an effort to paint Republicans as fringe conspiracy theorists.

“I know almost nothing about it,” Trump Jr. said. “I think it’s one of those things — yes, reject it — but … I’m around more Republicans and conservatives around the country than anyone and it barely if ever comes up.”

“I think it’s one of those things the media attaches to,” he added. “I don’t see it being as big an issue as everyone makes it out to be. In my life, in my politics, it’s a nonissue.”

On the presidential front, Trump Jr. expressed confidence his father would win a second term in office.

He said Democrats have a blind spot when it comes to addressing the violent aspects of the racial injustice protests. This week, Kenosha, Wis., became the latest American city to experience civil unrest — including buildings being set on fire — in response to police violence against a Black man.

Trump Jr. said the destructive elements of the protests, and the Democratic lawmakers he said are turning a blind eye to crimes committed by protesters, would turn moderate suburban voters away from Democrats in November.

“When you look at Middle America, suburban people, that’s coming to your backyard soon enough and [Democrats are] showing they’re not willing to confront what at any other point in history … would clearly be crime,” Trump Jr. said.

He pointed to recent polling in Minnesota that has found Trump running even with Democratic nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE, saying the move in Trump’s direction has in part been driven by frustration with the destruction of parts of Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed.

“People are looking around at their major cities and saying this could happen here,” Trump Jr. said.

“The left always overplays their hands so badly I think people will wake up and say, 'This is ridiculous,' ” he added.

Trump Jr. said he’s not concerned about polling showing Trump trailing nationally and in most of the battleground states, saying there is a “ghost component” that election analysts aren’t accounting for.

Republicans insist that so-called shy Trump voters who don’t want to reveal they support the president to pollsters or the news media will be a major surprise on Election Day.

“The media has been so biased and if you’re a conservative … I don’t think someone is going to tell people on the phone, some stranger calling who they’re actually voting for,” Trump Jr. said.",2020-08-25 14:45:02-04:00,

“I knew he was going to run even if he didn't know if he was going to run,” Richmond recalled in an interview with The Hill last year.

Now, with Biden extending his lead over Trump in the polls, Democratic colleagues and insiders are buzzing that Richmond could soon be leaving Capitol Hill to join a future Biden administration in the White House or as a Cabinet member.

Lawmakers set for tearful goodbye to John Lewis MORE (D-Ind.), who first met Richmond more than a decade ago when they were both state legislators. “It depends on what Cedric wants to do, but wherever Cedric’s gonna be, he’s going to rise to the top. He’s a rock star.”

Last year, Biden named Richmond, a former Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) chairman from New Orleans, a national co-chairman of his presidential campaign. It proved to be a smart pick, as Richmond shored up support for Biden from African American lawmakers and voters in the South who would help propel him to the Democratic nomination.

More recently, Biden appointed Richmond as one of the co-chairs of his transition team, an exclusive group of Biden insiders responsible for helping the former vice president fill out his Cabinet and administration should he win on Nov. 3.

Lawmakers and Biden insiders say there are several top jobs that Richmond could step into on day one of a new Democratic administration.

He could follow in the footsteps of Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic congressman who became former President Obama’s first White House chief of staff. Or he could be tapped as Commerce or Labor secretary. He also may be interested in serving in a more behind-the scenes role as a senior adviser to the president in the mold of Valerie Jarrett Valerie June JarrettThe Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Goldman Sachs - Pelosi, Mnuchin push stimulus talks forward, McConnell applies brakes Jacobin Editor-at-Large: Valerie Jarrett's support for Citigroup executive's mayoral campaign 'microcosm' of Democrats' relationship with Wall Street Hollywood gives Biden's digital campaign final star-studded push MORE or Patrick Gaspard, who both had tremendous access to Obama in the West Wing.

One job that might be appealing to Richmond is U.S. trade representative, sources said, a Cabinet-level position that has greater proximity to the president since it falls under the Executive Office of the President. It’s also a job that has incredible influence over trade and economic policy, which would be critical to the port communities of his native Louisiana.

“I think he’d have his choice,” said one longtime Biden aide. “Since he was on board so early, he will get what he wants.”

For now, Richmond, 47, isn’t saying anything publicly or even privately about his next move. His close friends in Congress say he hasn’t hinted that he’s angling for a job in a future Biden administration. And Richmond, who declined to be interviewed for this story, has only said he’s focused this fall on winning reelection to the 2nd Congressional District of Louisiana and ensuring that Biden ousts Trump from the White House.

One ally said Richmond may want to stay in the House, where he would have Biden on speed dial. That relationship could help Richmond shape and influence legislation, as well as echo Biden’s message to reporters on Capitol Hill.

“Either way, he wins,” said one House Democrat. “If he’s in the administration, he can kill it. If he’s on Capitol Hill, he can kill it” because he will have a direct line to Biden.

Just last month, Richmond was appointed to a coveted seat on the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee that became vacant after the death of the beloved civil rights icon Rep.

House lawmakers describe Richmond, an attorney and five-term lawmaker, as a talented political strategist who is tough but even-tempered and pragmatic, on top of being loyal to friends and allies. He has the pulse of his Democratic colleagues, constantly checking in with them and listening to their ideas.

“If I get intense about something, he takes me right back to reality,” Rep.

But if he’s got to intervene, he knows when to intervene.”

Richmond is also in tune with voters in the South, particularly Black voters.

All of those attributes helped steady the Biden campaign and calm jittery establishment Democrats during a tumultuous stretch in February when Sen.

Throughout the primary, Richmond worked the phones and the House floor. He set up calls between Biden and his colleagues, racking up lawmaker endorsements for Biden. The Louisiana Democrat would also tell colleagues, reporters, anyone who would listen: Just wait until South Carolina, that’s when everything will change for Biden.

Richmond proved to be right about South Carolina. Despite getting trounced by Sanders in New Hampshire and Nevada, Biden roared back with a lopsided victory in the Palmetto State — bolstered by a game-changing endorsement three days before the election from House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.), a former Black Caucus chairman and a longtime mentor to Richmond.

Clyburn’s timely endorsement had Richmond’s fingerprints all over it.

The two men would fight about policy by day and “in the evening we would go play basketball and we would have drinks together,” Richmond told The Advocate in Baton Rouge.

Scalise won a seat in Congress in 2008, and Richmond followed him to Washington two years later. Their friendship — and a friendly rivalry — grew each year when they faced off at the annual charity Congressional Baseball Game, where Richmond has been the dominating starting pitcher for the Democrats.

But that bipartisan friendship was tested in 2014 after reports that Scalise had addressed a white supremacist as a state lawmaker 12 years earlier. Scalise, then the House majority whip, faced calls to resign from Congress, but Richmond rushed to his defense, not only saying his close friend didn’t have “a racist bone in his body,” but also advising Scalise on how to repair his relationship with the Black community.

Fellow CBC members and other Democrats were furious at Richmond for saving Scalise’s political career; Richmond was unfazed. And in 2017, the Democrat again was there for him, rushing to the hospital after the GOP whip was nearly killed by a deranged gunman during a baseball practice.

Scalise, now the No. 2 GOP leader, hasn’t forgotten those gestures, even as he’s working to reelect Trump.

“Cedric is a dear friend who is a smart, hard-working, rising star in the House,” Scalise told The Hill. “We have been able to maintain a strong friendship despite our political differences, and still work together on issues important to Louisiana and our nation.”

Gloves come off as Democrats fight for House seat in California,"The race between two progressive Democrats to occupy an open seat in California is turning abrasive and expensive, resurfacing pent-up frustrations by Hispanics about the challenges they face when running for office.

San Diego City Council President Georgette Gómez is facing off against Sara Jacobs, an heiress to the Qualcomm fortune in the race in the 53rd District to replace retiring Rep. Susan Davis Susan Carol DavisOvernight Defense: Congress recommends nuclear arms treaty be extended | Dems warn Turkey | Military's eighth COVID death identified Bipartisan congressional task force recommends extending nuclear treaty with Russia The Hill's Campaign Report: Minneapolis protests rock the nation MORE (D-Calif.).

Hispanics are rallying around Gómez amid growing frustration that Latino candidates face tougher odds in gaining statewide office, though Jacobs is avidly courting statewide support as she pitches herself as a young candidate for change.

While Hispanics comprise more than 17 percent of the U.S. population, only 43 members of the House of Representatives, just under 10 percent of the total membership, are Hispanic.

Meanwhile, California currently has elected 11 Latinos to the House out of 53 seats, in a state where around 40 percent of the population is Hispanic.

""Voters have a decision to make in this district. They can elect the first openly LGBTQ Latina to Congress by voting for a local homegrown leader like Georgette, who's fought for environmental justice, affordable housing and health care, or support a self-funded candidate,"" Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.) told The Hill.

""This November, we are looking forward to Georgette making history as the first openly LGBTQ Latina in Congress,"" he added.

Because of California's ""jungle primary"" system, the two Democrats are competing in November's general election after advancing as the top two from the primary in March from a field of 11 Democrats, three Republicans and an Independent.

Both candidates are running on similarly progressive platforms, including support for ""Medicare for All"" and providing a pathway for citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients.

Gómez also has the support of key members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), including Cárdenas, who chairs the CHC's campaign arm, Bold PAC, an organization that's spent nearly $150,000 supporting Gómez through its independent expenditure program.

Jacobs, meanwhile, has earned her own share of national and state endorsements, including California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis (D), Colorado Gov.

Jacobs has so far raised $3.3 million, $2.7 million of which she's contributed, and spent $3.1 million. Gómez has raised $900,000 and spent $800,000.

Jacobs unsuccessfully ran in 2018 for the seat currently held by CHC member Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) in a separate district, spending heavily on her bid.

That is a sore spot for California Hispanic Democrats, who say they often have to compete against better funded opponents in the party.

""As usual, it's big money, big muscle vs. name ID and a history of being of service to the community. That's the usual story of Latinos in politics, usually outspent and outgunned, but we make up for it with hard work, day in and day out,"" said Rep. Lou Correa Jose (Lou) Luis CorreaCriminalization that never should have been: Cannabis Man arrested, charged with threatening to attack Muslims in Germany Gloves come off as Democrats fight for House seat in California MORE (D-Calif.), who endorsed Gómez.

A super PAC founded by Jacobs's grandparents, Qualcomm co-founder Irwin Jacobs and his wife Joan Jacobs, has independently spent nearly $1.4 million supporting Jacobs.

The Gómez campaign has sought to turn the spending by Forward California into a campaign issue.

""I want it to be less expensive. I'm not the deciding factor in how much money one needs to raise. I know what my competition is willing to spend. We have seen it. When she ran in the 49th and how much money, money spent and pumped into that election, didn't win,"" Gómez told The Hill.

The Jacobs campaign, however, defended her fundraising ability.

""Sara is proud of the grassroots campaign we've built: raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from grassroots donors, knocking on tens of thousands of doors across the district, and earning the backing of a broad coalition of leaders,"" wrote Jacobs spokesman Andrew Godinich.

The disadvantage Gómez faces in fundraising is a reality that could make her more reliant on outside groups like Bold PAC as November approaches.

That reality could be risky for Gómez, as Democrats will likely invest more in districts that could fall to Republicans in November.

""Sara believes that if we want politics to be different, we have to do politics differently. That means not accepting any corporate PAC money, paying our staff a living wage, and paying our interns $15 an hour so that more young people have opportunities to be part of the political process. It also means not running a campaign against someone, but rather focusing on talking directly to voters about what we are running for,"" wrote Godinich.

Gómez has also sought to lean into a media report that Jacobs inflated aspects of her work experience during her 2018 primary run.

In 2018, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported Jacobs had overstated the importance of her role at the State Department during the Obama administration.

Jacobs has defended her work in the State Department, while touting her understanding of how the federal government works and her policy experience. She has also heavily touted her work experience, including for nonprofits.

Nonetheless, Latino organizations, while bemoaning the fact that intraparty fighting can get in the way of their goal of achieving representational parity for Hispanics, say they will back Gómez strongly and say they plan to continue hitting Jacobs over her financial power.

""This is a race that's a no-brainer for us in terms of increasing representation,"" said Mayra Macías, executive director of Latino Victory, a progressive Latino organization that's endorsed Gómez

""I can't say what [Jacobs's] family wants to do with their money, but it is not a good example of a democracy. If someone can buy their way in,"" said Macías.

""She's investing resources, her family's investing resources in enough PACs to support her. And that is the advantage she has, that she is able to outspend Georgette. If it looks like a duck, if it sounds like a duck, it's a duck,"" she added.",2020-05-29 05:56:56-04:00,
House Democrats call on State Department for information on Uighur prisoner Ekpar Asat,"A group of House Democrats in the Blue Dog Coalition raised concerns Wednesday about the status of Uighur prisoner Ekpar Asat, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in a secret trial following his return to China.

Prior to his imprisonment, Asat, an entrepreneur and philanthropist, participated in a State Department program in the United States and founded a social media platform for Uighurs.

In a letter spearheaded by Rep. Max Rose Max RoseDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority MORE (D-N.Y.) sent to Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai on Tuesday, the lawmakers called for information on Asat, noting he had disappeared into the Chinese detention system and had not spoken to his family since 2016.

ADVERTISEMENT

The group noted that Asat has been portrayed in a positive light in the Chinese media, yet was accused of “inciting ethnic hatred” after taking part in the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) and for providing a digital platform for Uighurs, called Bagdax.

“Mr. Asat was selected for the [State Department] program due to his work cultivating cross-cultural ties between ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China and the government in the Uyghur region,"" the lawmakers wrote.

“We understand that Mr. Asat and Bagdax have been portrayed favorably in the Chinese media as a means of bridging cultural divides in China. Particularly considering this information, we are deeply concerned that Mr. Asat was reportedly detained and sentenced to 15 years in prison on suspicion of allegedly ‘inciting ethnic hatred,"" they wrote.

Before returning to China, Asat told his sister who lived in Cambridge, Mass., at the time he planned to return to the United States within months, but was later detained, The New York Times first reported.

The group went on to praise Asat’s work, asserting they believe his participation in the State Department program demonstrates his dedication to unifying communities in both China and the United States. The lawmakers noted that the social media platform he created is still operating in China.

“We understand that Bagdax continues to operate despite Mr. Asat’s disappearance, indicating that the company remains committed to its mission of bringing different ethnic groups together in China,” the letter said.

“Throughout the IVLP, Mr. Asat sought to gain knowledge of American culture and technology as a means of improving his own platform, consistent with Chinese law, policy, and regulations. His American hosts convey that he was a curious, warm, and friendly participant, frequently looking after his fellow group members and representing the best of China’s diversity,"" the lawmakers noted.

The group also stressed that Chinese delegates in the IVLP program have a substantial impact on U.S.-China relations.

“The targeting of one participant undermines the program’s ability to continue this work,” they wrote. ""We urge you to provide clarity regarding Mr. Asat’s status and to release him to his family as soon as possible.”

Asat’s family, along with more than 80 Harvard-educated lawyers, are also calling for the State Department to further intervene and petitioning the Chinese government for his release.

Yet amid the national unrest over racial injustice in law enforcement — which has found the country reckoning with its racist past and Congress rushing to combat police violence against African Americans — some CBC leaders say the math has changed, and seniority should not eclipse efforts to diversify the Democrats’ power structure.

And the fact that Mr. Meeks is African American, I think, is a major factor, and maybe should trump — let me not use that word — be of more weight than seniority.”

Such thinking marks a shift within the CBC, which has derived much of its power on Capitol Hill from members rising to the top of committees based largely on seniority. The group boasts gavels on four key panels, including Financial Services, Homeland Security and Education and Labor.

But in the event of Engel’s ouster — and a subsequent race between Sherman and Meeks to head Foreign Affairs next year — prominent members of the group are already indicating they’re ready to discard the seniority formula.

""I think seniority is the major consideration but not the only one,” said Rep.

“Foreign policy, that’s the expertise I bring to Congress. It’s a passion of mine,” Connolly, a former staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told The Hill on Thursday. “But I believe it’s premature to be speculating given the fact that the outcome of the chairman’s race in New York has not been determined.""

“Would I be interested? Yes, of course. Am I running? Will I run? Those are different questions that have to be assessed if and when the opportunity arises,” said Connolly, who lost a race for the Oversight Committee gavel last year to the more senior Rep.

While emphasizing that it’s too early to know the roster of candidates who might vie to replace Engel if he loses, she was also quick to note that Democrats have, at times, empowered junior members to leapfrog over more experienced lawmakers on committees.

Democrats prioritize seniority “until we don’t,” she said. “Of which you've seen many times.""

Bass made clear that she’s not interested in the Foreign Affairs gavel.

Indeed, Engel rose to become top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel by jumping over the more senior Sherman, who had ruffled feathers in the caucus by defeating Rep. Howard Berman (D-Calif.), a popular party veteran, in a fierce 2012 primary after redistricting. Democrats said they remember Sherman attacking Berman, then the ranking member of Foreign Affairs, for focusing too much on international travel rather than his district back home.

“Brad has enormous baggage,” said one Democrat on Foreign Affairs. “And the Californians of that era do not forget what Brad Sherman did to Howard Berman. Not that he beat him, but how he beat him: attacked him for doing his job.”

Meanwhile, both Sherman and Meeks are playing it coy. Both noted that the votes in Engel’s primary race are still being counted, and both were careful not to project an image that they’re lobbying to replace him.

""The race hasn't been called. They're going to count every vote, and I have tremendous respect for Eliot Engel,” Sherman said.

Still, Sherman endorsed the notion that seniority should outweigh most other factors, and seemed to allude to the CBC’s previous support for that very position.

“I'm on record: I've always honored the seniority system. And others I think are on record also,” he said. “But that's for some other time.""

Meeks had endorsed Engel when it became clear that his challenger, a liberal African American educator named Jamaal Bowman, was posing a serious threat to Engel’s bid for a 17th term.

“What I'm interested is trying to make sure every vote is counted for Mr. Engel, because my priority is to make sure that Mr. Engel remains as chair of this committee,” Meeks said Wednesday. “And there's a whole lot of votes out there to be counted. And I know that every vote counts.”

While publicly reticent, both Sherman and Meeks are jockeying for position.

Sherman is said to be calling colleagues in search of their support. And outside the Capitol, where Democrats had gathered Wednesday morning to promote their police reforms, Meeks was seeking an audience with some members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. And those members seemed to know it.

“I know,” Costa responded.

Engel, a congressman for over three decades, was elected to the chairmanship in 2018 when Democrats took the majority in the House. He had earlier served as the ranking member and as chairperson and ranking member of the subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere.

His campaign for reelection was thrown in jeopardy earlier this month when he was caught on a hot mic seemingly saying he wouldn’t have attended an event against racial injustice in his district if he wasn’t competing in a primary.

That moment gave ammunition to his challenger, Bowman, to paint the congressman as out of touch with his constituency and receive critical endorsement from progressives in the House, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.).

As chairman, Engel is overseeing two probes against the Trump administration, an investigation into the firing of the State Department’s inspector general and a purge of senior officials at the U.S. Agency for Global Media by Trump’s appointee to lead the agency.

A staunch advocate for Israel, Engel has made his mark on the committee focusing on ensuring security assistance for the Jewish state while also promoting a two-state solution to the conflict with the Palestinians.

As chairman, he has advanced a human rights agenda, drafting the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act that put sanctions on Syria’s President Bashar Assad and others complicit in the indiscriminate killing, torture and suffering of civilians caught up in almost a decade of war.

Engel is unlikely to concede defeat until all votes are counted in the district, something that could last well past the end of the month as absentee ballots continue to funnel in.

But the current numbers skew in favor of Bowman, who has garnered more than 60 percent of the counted votes.

LEADING THE DAY:

The political world is reacting to the demonstrations taking place in Minneapolis this week in the wake of the death of George Floyd, an African American man who died Monday after a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest.

President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE made headlines on Friday after he threatened on Twitter to deploy the military and denounced ""thugs"" in the midwestern city. Twitter labeled the president’s post, saying the tweet violated the platform's rules about glorifying violence.

Trump’s rival, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE, was quick to denounce the tweet, accusing Trump of calling for violence.

“I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many,” Biden said in a tweet.

The White House denied Trump was glorifying violence, and said he condemned it.

The week’s events involving Floyd’s death and the subsequent protests have put the spotlight once again on police violence and racial tensions in the U.S. The issue will likely be widely talked about on the campaign trail, with many in the U.S. calling for police reform and nationwide conversation about race.

Biden said Friday in an online address to supporters that he spoke to George Floyd’s family.

""We are a country with an open wound. And none of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us can any longer, can we hear the words 'I can't breath' and do nothing,"" Biden said. ""The original sin of this country still stains our nation today, and sometimes we manage to overlook it.”

The Hill’s Amie Parnes and Scott Wong report that the death of Floyd and the subsequent protests has also prompted greater scrutiny over Biden’s vice presidential pick.

“I think this definitely makes him think twice and a third time about it,” one longtime Biden ally close to the campaign told Parnes and Wong.

“He's definitely going to get increased pressure from the black community. You're already seeing that with new hires.”

Chef Emeril Lagasse is the latest celebrity to pledge his support to combat the coronavirus pandemic. His foundation, the Emeril Lagasse Foundation, is donating $500,000 toward coronavirus relief efforts to support youth programs and families of hospitality industry workers in Louisiana, Nevada and Florida.

“The need to support the youth in our community is a priority of Alden and I through the work of our Foundation. The need is more overwhelming than ever,” the chef said in a statement earlier this week. “We are committed to our mission of helping disadvantaged youth during this extraordinary time.”

The foundation says it will give out grants in a multi-tiered response, giving immediate funding to some causes as well as long-term funding to others.

The most recent round of rapid response grants is aiding organizations that provide essential services to vulnerable communities. The organizations include Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana, Covenant House, Café Reconcile, Café Hope, Liberty’s Kitchen, Youth Empowerment Project and Three Square Food Bank of Las Vegas.

In a statement to The Hill on Monday, Loomer, who The Palm Beach Post reports is one of six candidates expected to face off in a Republican primary in Florida's 21st District later this month, expressed confidence about her campaign’s chances.

“I’m going to win,” she said, claiming her victory will mark the “first time a deplatformed candidate will get a party nomination.”

If Loomer does make it past the coming primary, she is expected to face a tough path to defeating Frankel in the left-leaning district.

Frankel won reelection in 2016 with more than 60 percent of the vote. In 2018, she ran unopposed.

Loomer has been booted from a number of social media and other technology platforms in recent years after making online anti-Muslim comments. In 2017, she was banned from Uber after she tweeted that “someone needs to create a non Islamic form of @uber or @lyft” and she has also been banned from platforms such as Twitter, PayPal and GoFundMe.

But a deal remains a long shot, as Democrats have held firm to their $2.2 trillion demand; Senate Republicans have balked at even the $1.8 trillion proposal from the White House; and President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE has confused the debate with a stream of mixed messages regarding what he supports.

""One major area of disagreement continues to be that the White House lacks an understanding of the need for a national strategic testing plan,"" Hammill tweeted. ""The Speaker believes we must reopen our economy & schools safely & soon, & scientists agree we must have a strategic testing plan.""

Speaking at a public conference shortly after his call with Pelosi, Mnuchin noted the distinct divisions blocking a deal, emphasizing entrenched differences remain over both the amount of new spending and the policy areas it should target.

""I don't agree with the Speaker's approach that we have to do all or nothing,"" Mnuchin said in an interview with the Milken Institute. He added that securing and executing a deal before the elections ""would be difficult just given where we are and the level of detail.”

Another area of disagreement is how much aid should be extended to state and local governments, which are struggling to fund the emergency response to the pandemic while simultaneously being squeezed by a loss of tax revenue.

Democrats had proposed $436 billion in aid for those localities, while the White House countered with $300 billion. Mnuchin on Wednesday said that number marked ""an extraordinary compromise"" on the part of the administration, suggesting the White House is not ready to raise its offer.

Another sticking point surrounds GOP demands for language protecting businesses and schools from liability if workers or students contract the virus — a demand Mnuchin amplified Wednesday.

Democrats are insisting that those liability protections be excluded, and appear equally unyielding in that demand.

The persistent disagreements have diminished the chances that the sides can reach a deal before the elections. And Trump, who has remained on the sidelines during the talks, has only muddled the debate.

Since testing positive for COVID-19 at the start of the month, Trump has vacillated between urging Congress to ""go big"" on a relief package, ending the talks, renewing them again with calls for a piecemeal approach, and then coming full circle to back another massive package. That $1.8 trillion proposal was quickly rejected by Senate Republicans, raising questions about whether any new relief will reach Trump's desk even if Pelosi and Mnuchin do seal a deal.

Republicans on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, have hammered Pelosi, saying the Speaker simply doesn't want an agreement, which might help Trump's reelection next month. Mnuchin said that concern is ""definitely an issue.""

Democrats have rejected that argument, noting that they've already passed two separate emergency aid bills without concern for the potential benefit to Trump's campaign. With less than three weeks before the elections, they say they're still pushing.

Letter from Trump taking credit for aid now mandated in government food boxes: report,"The Department of Agriculture is mandating that letters from President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE be included in millions of food assistance boxes, according to Politico.

The $4 billion Families to Farmers Food Box Program has distributed 100 million boxes already, the USDA announced Wednesday. The program delivers surplus goods that would normally go to restaurants to families experiencing financial hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Organizations tasked with distributing the food have complained that the messaging and campaign-like letters included in the boxes appear to have the goal of boosting the president’s image ahead of the election.

“In my 30 years of doing this work, I've never seen something this egregious,” said Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Food Banks, told Politico. ""These are federally purchased boxes.”

The fact that the letters were included in some of the boxes was first reported by Fox News in July. On Wednesday the White House posted a campaign-style video on Twitter touting the food boxes with remarks Trump made in North Carolina in August before a crowd of a few hundred people.

The letter, which comes in English and Spanish, says: “As President, safeguarding the health and well-being of our citizens is one of my highest priorities. As part of our response to coronavirus, I prioritized sending nutritious food from our farmers to families in need throughout America.”

Some lawmakers have argued that the letters could potentially violate the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal officials besides the president and vice president from engaging in politics in their official capacity.

“A public health crisis is not an opportunity for the administration to promote its own political interests. Likewise, a federal food assistance program should not be used as a tool for the President to exploit taxpayer dollars for his re-election campaign.”

GOP seizes on 'defund the police' to galvanize base,"Republicans are seizing on calls to ""defund the police"" in down-ballot races across the country, taking their cues from President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s criticism of the movement.

The attacks by Republicans in state and congressional races reflect their belief that a movement that has gained traction amid nationwide protests roiling the country will galvanize their base ahead of November, citing polling that shows Americans remain skeptical of taking funds away from police.

A Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released to The Hill this week found 72 percent of respondents saying police departments should not be defunded, while 28 percent said the departments should be defunded.

Meanwhile, 57 percent of voters said they opposed the term “defund the police,” but supported major reforms to departments, according to a Politico/Morning Consult survey released last week.

“It’s not the term that is not popular with people across the country, it’s the policy and the actual plan,” said Austin Chambers, the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC). “The people we’re really after in the 2020 election that are going to determine these elections from the top of the ticket all the way down know exactly what defund the police means, and they’re scared to death of it.”

Those in favor of defunding police departments argue that police departments are currently over-funded and call for reallocating some of their funding to social services or push for alternative public safety forces.

Though initially a core platform of the Black Lives Matter movement, the policy has gained traction among a wider swath of protesters and progressive activists after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.

Still, most Democratic leaders, including former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE, have expressed opposition to defunding the police, even as they call for police reform.

Despite the opposition by many national Democrats, the move to defund the police has gained traction in some cities across the country. New York City and Los Angeles are among major cities looking into cutting funding for their police force. Meanwhile, Minneapolis’s city council voted earlier this month to dismantle the policy department in favor of a community-led public safety approach after Floyd's death.

That has given Republicans eyeing Congressional and legislative races across the country an opening to seize on the issue.

Tamika Hamilton — a Black GOP Air Force veteran challenging Rep. John Garamendi John Raymond GaramendiWuhan is the final straw: The world needs to divest from China GOP seizes on 'defund the police' to galvanize base Peace Corps faces uncertain future with no volunteers in field MORE (D-Calif.) in California’s 3rd District — said she’s made hundreds of calls to voters within the last week to discuss her position on police reform, which she feels needs to protect “civil rights of the community, as well as the police officers and we also need to make sure that those bad apples are held accountable.”

Hamilton, who's also married to a police officer, said the voters she’s spoken with have largely voiced support for law enforcement, adding that most of the negative comments directed at her over her support for police have been on social media from people who live outside the district.

“I feel like I'm in one of those crazy positions because I'm in the military had been for 17 years. And then my husband's a police officer. And then on top of that I'm Black,"" she told The Hill. ""I've felt a lot of responsibility on all fronts to speak out on it. And it hasn't affected my campaign negatively because people are like you are the best spokesperson for this,” she told The Hill.

Among the attack ads being used, the State Government Leadership Fund (SGLF), a policy group that works with the RSLC, released an ad targeting Democrats on defunding the police.

The ad, titled “Danger,” shows a mother portrayed by an actor calling the police amid a break-in and being told by a 9-1-1 operator that an officer was not available, as images of her husband and child flash on the screen.

“Radical liberals are fighting for a police-free future,” a narrator says. “Don’t let them put your family in danger.”

The spot was part of television and digital buys in Atlanta, Tampa, Charlotte, Minneapolis, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, and Dallas.

Will Douglas, a biracial GOP candidate running for Texas’s 113th State House District in Dallas, called the push to defund police departments “absurd” in an interview with The Hill.

“I haven’t spoken to any voter who thinks that defunding or abolishing the police is a rational idea,” Douglas said.

“I do believe that there needs to be reform around procedures and how confrontation is handled,” he said. “It’s something that I think both sides can agree on, but unfortunately those on one side of the aisle want to take money away from them.”

Shay Hawkins, a Black Republican candidate running for Ohio’s 6th State House District, said the responsibility for reform should lie with local politicians who oversee police departments.

“Politicians have failed and now their solution is to basically blame a group of employees [police], 99.9 percent of which are probably not bad actors,” Hawkins said. “This is their primary job, keeping their citizens safe.”

The Republican push to seize on defund the police as a campaign theme comes as polls show Trump falling behind to Biden in national polls and a slew of battleground states, as voters express misgivings about the White House's response to the coronavirus pandemic and the racial protests hitting the country.

Trump's declining standing has also raised fears that it would hurt Republicans in down-ballot races.

But Trump, and now down-balled Republicans, have doubled down on ""law and order"" as a campaign theme in recent weeks. Trump has also repeatedly vowed to protect the police and come down hard on protesters following instances of violence that have popped up amid the largely peaceful protests.

“It’s going to boil down to simply, do you want to fund the police department, and you want real leadership and you want to heal the divide in this country, or do you want to defund your police department and have lawlessness and chaos in this country,” Chambers, the head of the RSLC, said.

“This is going to create a huge divide on their side,” he added. “It’s going to create a great opportunity for Republicans to bring back the suburbs, win these key seats in the states we gotta win, and I think it’s going to benefit the president as well.”",2020-06-27 16:15:07-04:00,
"Texas social workers drop nondiscrimination rules for LGBTQ, disabilities","Texas state social workers have dropped some protections for LGBTQ Americans and people with disabilities following a recommendation from the governor's office that advised the agency governing social work in the state that its nondiscrimination policy exceeded that put in place by Texas's Occupations Code.

The Associated Press reported Monday that the decision was made at a joint meeting between the Texas State Board of Social Work Examiners and the Texas Behavioral Health Executive Council. The change, prompted by the governor's office, eliminates language from the Board of Social Work Examiners' code of conduct that prohibited social work organizations in the state from turning away people based on their gender identity, sexual orientation or disability status.

Monday's decision was sharply criticized by social work organizations and LGBTQ advocacy groups, including the Texas chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, whose director called it “incredibly disheartening.”

“It’s disturbing, even if it’s unintentional,” Will Francis told the AP. “They created space for people to get the impression that this is allowed now. What the governor has done is put people with disabilities at risk for discrimination for no reason.”

“Many LGBTQ+ Texans struggle to access competent, quality, and affordable health care as is,” said Emmett Schelling, executive director of the Transgender Education Network of Texas in a press release from Equality Texas, an LGTBQ group.

“There is always a real possibility that trans Texans specifically could be turned away or dissuaded from accessing the medical resources they need. At a time when many in our community require services to make it through an isolating pandemic, attempting to grant providers a license to discriminate is abhorrent,"" Schelling said.

Rep. Sylvia Garcia Sylvia GarciaTexas social workers drop nondiscrimination rules for LGBTQ, disabilities Hispanic Caucus asks for Department of Labor meeting on COVID in meatpacking plants Texas Democrat proposes legislation requiring masks in federal facilities MORE (D-Texas), who represents parts of Houston and the surrounding area, urged the board to reverse its decision in a statement Tuesday.

""As a former social worker, I’m appalled by the new rule the Texas State Board of Social Work Examiners approved last week,"" she said. ""In the middle of a life-threatening, unprecedented pandemic, no one should be denied services for who they are.""

""This rule change was rushed without input from professional social workers. I hope the Governor and the Board will recognize the terrible repercussions this will have on the safety and well-being of some Texans in the state and will reverse this decision immediately,"" added Garcia.

Hispanic Caucus asks for Department of Labor meeting on COVID in meatpacking plants,"The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) asked Thursday for a meeting with Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia Eugene ScaliaWhy millennials will win Trump's war on socially responsible investing Business groups, universities file lawsuit over new rules targeting H-1B visas Baldwin calls for Senate hearing on CDC response to meatpacking plant coronavirus outbreak MORE and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) head Loren Sweatt to clarify the agency's oversight of working conditions at meatpacking plants amid coronavirus.

""Even with alarming irregularities in reported data, trends across the board show that there has not been a flattening in the number of new COVID-19 cases in this sector since the pandemic began,"" wrote CHC Chairman Joaquín Castro (D-Texas).

Castro added that 33,000 cases of coronavirus have been tied to meatpacking plants, and ""at least 132 meatpacking workers have died.""

""Yet, in light of these numbers, OSHA only issued its first coronavirus workplace citation to a nursing home in Ohio in late July and has not yet issued any citations to meat or poultry processing facilities,"" wrote Castro.

Meatpacking as an industry disproportionately employs people of color, particularly Latinos, who often have to work in close proximity to each other.

The coronavirus pandemic has brought light to the issue of worker safety in meat and poultry processing centers, a longstanding topic among Hispanic labor activists.

But questions have been raised about whether reducing crowding or line speeds in those plants could risk the overall food supply.

And some officials, like Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, have privately blamed the lifestyle of meatpacking workers on the high rates of coronavirus transmission.

Castro wrote that the CHC does not feel companies and federal regulators are doing enough to protect workers at meat and poultry packing centers.

In his letter, Castro asked Scalia and Sweatt for the meeting to respond to a series of questions on Labor and OSHA's roles in supervising proper workplace conditions amid the pandemic.

A representative for the Department of Labor did not immediately return a request for comment.

In June, CHC members met with meatpacking labor representatives and the heads of the largest meat and poultry processing companies.

The CHC is seeking to strengthen federal oversight of the industry, and to pass measures such as hazard pay for essential workers.

""We cannot sit back and watch as the vulnerable communities that make up a majority of this industry’s essential workforce face dangerous working conditions. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, almost one-half, 44 percent, of meatpacking workers are Hispanic, and according to CDC data last accessed in early July, 87% of workers in the meat and poultry industry who tested positive belonged to racial or ethnic minorities,"" wrote Castro.

“As Congress continues to work on additional COVID-19 relief efforts, it is incumbent upon us to take simple common sense actions that will prioritize the safety and well-being of federal workers and the general public that visit federal government buildings,” Garcia said in a statement.

These facilities are required to provide face masks at entrances for those who do not own one. The bill allows a federal agency to remove or deny service to anyone who does not wear a mask.

Garcia called for the bill to be included in the next congressional COVID-19 relief package.

“As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to keep people safe and we know based on CDC guidelines that wearing a face mask could make the difference between life and death during this pandemic,” she said.

Florida county official apologizes for social media post invoking Hitler,"A Florida county court official apologized for sharing a Facebook post that falsely attributed a quote to Adolf Hitler.

Clerk of Courts Brenda Forman (D) issued an apology to the Jewish community after the local congressional delegation condemned her remarks, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported.

“I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community,” she wrote in a statement posted to Facebook, adding that she deeply regrets “the pain that it has caused to members of your community. It was never my intention to hurt or offend anyone.”

Forman initially shared the post on Monday night that falsely attributed a quote to the Nazi leader and was accompanied by a doctored image of former British Prime Minister David Cameron, according to screenshots.

The fake quote, incorrectly attributed to Hitler’s “Mein Kampf,” calls for freedom to be removed slowly over time “to erode rights by a thousand tiny and almost imperceptible reductions” until it is too late.

The passage has circulated on social media in the past, the outlet noted, and Reuters and Politifact concluded it wasn’t from Hitler’s autobiography.

The image was reportedly flagged by Facebook’s independent fact-checkers and labeled with a warning about containing false information.

The post quickly started gaining criticism, and Forman deleted it on Tuesday night without acknowledging it, according to the outlet.

“I do hope Ms. Forman heard our concerns and realizes how dangerous it is to share this hate without any explanation - how it empowers this hate,” he wrote. “Sharing Hitler's words, especially when you do not clearly frame why you are doing so, can be so dangerous.”

Forman released an apology on Thursday, saying she takes “full responsibility for resharing this un acceptable post.”

“In retrospect, there were better ways I could have expressed my thoughts on how important it is for our society to work together to ensure that no one is deprived of their rights,” Forman wrote. “As a woman of color and an elected official, I have worked hard to use my platform to advocate for a variety of community causes.

"Lawmakers, public bid farewell to John Lewis","Throngs of mourners flocked to Capitol Hill this week to join lawmakers, human rights activists and family members in bidding farewell to Rep.

Lewis, 80, was a legendary figure on Capitol Hill, and he made history even after his death, becoming the nation’s first Black lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda.

The line of people waiting to pay their respects on Monday and Tuesday at times wrapped all the way around the nearby Supreme Court, despite the intense summer heat.

The crowds underscored Lewis’s profound impact on civil rights in America, from his efforts at sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, and being the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington to leading the march in Selma, Ala., on what became known as Bloody Sunday that ultimately helped lead to passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

The ceremonial arrangements this week were altered dramatically by the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic. Rather than allowing members of the public to enter the Capitol Rotunda to pay their respects, Lewis’s casket was moved to the top of the east front steps so that people could walk past outside.

But the public health threat did little to discourage the crowds of well-wishers who descended on the Capitol for a last goodbye. People were in line until late Monday night and as soon as the public viewing resumed early Tuesday morning.

That, Lewis’s allies said, was no surprise.

Jesse Jackson, the Baptist minister and civil rights activist who twice ran for president, also came on Tuesday to bid farewell to Lewis.

“Yesterday’s ceremony was short at John’s request. He was a humble human being. He was a great presence, a great person, as I say, Christ-like in so many ways. But very humble, self-effacing. Not necessarily wanting the attention on him, but on the vision that he had for a beloved community and a commitment to making America live out its ideals,” Hoyer said Tuesday on CNN.

While Lewis laid in state in the Capitol Rotunda, his flag-draped casket rested atop a catafalque originally constructed in 1865 for when President Lincoln received the same honor.

During the outdoor viewing, an honor guard kept round-the-clock watch over his casket behind a display of white flowers at the top of the Capitol steps.

A steady stream of onlookers of all ages and races filed past at the bottom of the steps, while many stopped to snap photos, gaze at the casket in silence or place their hands over their hearts.

The House canceled floor votes for Tuesday while Lewis lay in state, but some committees still carried on with hearings. Lewis nevertheless loomed large in lawmakers’ minds as they proceeded with seemingly unrelated business.

Richmond, a co-chairman of Biden’s presidential campaign, criticized Barr over an apparent lack of Black officials among his top staff at the Justice Department.

“That, sir, is systematic racism. That is exactly what John Lewis spent his life fighting. And so I would just suggest that actions speak louder than words. And you should really keep the name of the honorable John Lewis out of the Department of Justice’s mouth,” Richmond said.

“Bill Barr hasn’t lifted a finger as Attorney General to protect voting rights in America,” she tweeted. “He has no business speaking John Lewis’s name.”

The House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis also held a moment of silence for Lewis before commencing a hearing on clean energy.

Pelosi stopped short of promising a House vote on a new emergency stimulus proposal before the chamber recesses at the end of September — a tactic endorsed by a growing number of moderate Democrats concerned about the political optics of leaving Washington without acting to address the health and economic fallout of the deadly pandemic.

Although the House passed the $3.4 trillion HEROES Act in May — a bill ignored by Senate Republicans — conditions on the ground have changed significantly in the four months since then, as the coronavirus death toll approaches 200,000, schools struggle to reopen, and tens of millions of workers remain unemployed. A growing chorus of centrist lawmakers are wary of returning to their districts just weeks before the elections with nothing new to show.

“It’s almost insulting to them to say, ‘In the HEROES Act, we’ve got one trillion for state and local, $75 billion for families,’ but where is that money?” he added. “They don’t want to hear the obstacle is solely sitting in the Senate.”

The strategic approach to the next round of coronavirus aid is splitting the caucus, with Democratic moderates — including those in the Blue Dog, New Democrat and Problem Solvers groups — pressing for action this month, while a large group of liberals and Pelosi loyalists are backing the Speaker’s hard-line resistance to moving a slimmer bill, or cutting the HEROES Act into smaller pieces.

“I don’t really see the point of negotiating with ourselves,” said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), chairman of the powerful Rules Committee.

Yet the moderates are finding their voice as the House has returned to Washington this week after a long summer recess.

Leaders of the Blue Dog Democrats have, for weeks, pressed Pelosi and other party leaders to take up another relief bill before the elections. On Monday, leaders of the New Democrat Coalition piled on, warning that lawmakers in battleground districts could be particularly harmed by congressional inaction. And the heads of the Problem Solvers, a bipartisan group of centrists, unveiled a new, $1.5 trillion aid package on Tuesday designed to pressure leaders in both parties to get moving on an elusive compromise.

The growing unrest prompted Pelosi to announce Tuesday that the House will remain in session until a deal is reached.

“We are committed to staying here until we have an agreement,” she told CNBC’s Jim Cramer.

The practical effects of the announcement, however, will likely be slight.

If such a deal emerges, then members would be called back to Washington. In that sense, the dynamics would look very similar to those surrounding the long August recess, when the Capitol was virtually empty.

“You could look at it as a distinction without a difference of the last few months,” Hoyer said on a press call. “But in another sense, it tells members, ‘Look, we know the election’s coming up, we know you want to go back and campaign. But understand this is a priority ... and that we are going to address it as soon as we possibly can.’”

Both Pelosi and Hoyer also conducted back-to-back phone briefings with the New Democrats on Tuesday afternoon, outlining the party’s plans for the remainder of the month.

On that call, Pelosi vowed not only to stay in session until an agreement is made, but to keep lawmakers in Washington until a deal is struck, if the caucus decided to do so, according to a source familiar with the conversation.

Hoyer, for his part, amplified his previous assertion that the House should vote on a new Democratic stimulus bill before the chamber adjourns at month’s end.

Some Democrats downplayed any divisions in the party’s highest ranks.

“Steny is not at odds with Pelosi,” said Brown, who spoke to Hoyer, a fellow Maryland Democrat, on the floor Tuesday. The two leaders merely differ “in the details,” he added.

Still, the difference in degrees has not gone unnoticed among moderates, who are hoping Hoyer’s approach wins the day.

“Steny certainly has been much more vocal in saying we should bring something sooner rather than later,” Brown said.",2020-09-15 18:41:38-04:00,

“We have to stay here until we have a bill,” Pelosi told lawmakers.

The surprise development reflects both the severity of the public health and economic crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the growing pressure Pelosi is facing from the moderate wing of her party, which is clamoring for leadership to vote on another aid package before Congress leaves town again for the elections.

The practical effects of the announcement, however, will likely be slight.

Pelosi on Tuesday said she agreed, vowing to extend the House’s initial recess date of Oct. 2 if the sides haven’t reached a deal beforehand.

“We are committed to staying here until we have an agreement,” she told CNBC’s Jim Cramer.

What such an agreement looks like — or whether it’s even possible — remains unclear. Pelosi and the Democrats had passed a $3.4 trillion relief package through the House in May, and the Speaker has since offered to bring the price tag down to $2.2 trillion. But both proposals were roundly rejected by the White House and Republicans in the Senate, who were calling for legislation in the $1 trillion range.

The package was a non-starter with Democrats, who quickly shot it down. But that has only fueled the Republican attacks that Democrats are unwilling to compromise on another round of emergency aid, even as tens of millions of workers remain unemployed and tens of thousands of businesses are grappling to survive.

Even as she vowed to keep the House in session, Pelosi did not back off her insistence that the next aid package must be robust, telling Democrats on Tuesday’s call that “a skinny bill is a Republican bill.”

Kim Schrier wins primary MORE (D-Wash.), a physician, also spoke up on the call urging passage of another relief package before the next recess.

Extending the calendar will likely lead to grumbling from some lawmakers, who are eager to return quickly to their districts ahead of the Nov. 3 elections. Some of those members may opt to vote by proxy, a system Pelosi adopted earlier in the year to acknowledge the unique public health threat posed by the coronavirus.

Total U.S. coronavirus deaths reported each morning this week: Monday, 194,081; Tuesday, 194,536; Wednesday 195,942.







Vice President Pence told The Hill on Tuesday that his televised debate with Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden begins two-day campaign sprint in battleground Pennsylvania Trump praises Texas supporters who surrounded Biden-Harris bus FBI investigating Biden bus surrounded by pro-Trump cars: report MORE (D-Calif.) next month is a chance to draw contrasts between President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE and former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE.

Calling Harris an “experienced debater,” Pence told reporter Brett Samuels during an interview aboard Air Force Two that Florida and Arizona (where Pence will campaign later this week) are of “great importance” for capturing a second term. He argued the president can expand the 2020 map by winning Minnesota, where Trump will campaign on Friday and where Pence hit the hustings on Tuesday.

“I don’t think I’m preparing any differently,” Pence told The Hill. “Certainly, I see ... a vice presidential debate as an opportunity to draw a contrast between the president and Joe Biden. And I know the president’s record. I’ve been there every step of the way.”

“She is certainly an experienced debater,” Pence said of Harris. “So we’re preparing in the same way we prepared the last time.”

“Florida’s of great importance. Arizona’s of great importance. We’re going to make sure we continue to campaign in those states,” Pence told The Hill when asked about “must-win” states for Trump.

The Pence-Harris debate takes place Oct. 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The vice president has plenty of debate experience as a former Indiana governor and against Sen.

Republicans who are rooting for Trump’s reelection and for continued majority control in the Senate say the president and Pence would do well to focus almost exclusively this fall on the strength of the U.S. economy that existed before the pandemic. They note that the unemployment rate, while still high, is declining as some jobs are regained, The Hill’s Jordain Carney reports. GOP optimism belies warning signs that the U.S. economic recovery is slowing, however.

Trump, who showcased an achievement in Middle East peace at a historic White House event on Tuesday, is ahead of Biden in polls that ask Americans which candidate would better handle the economy. Niall Stanage writes in his latest Memo that the president’s campaign on Tuesday released a new wave of ads focused on the economy and job creation. The campaign announced that it was boosting TV ad spending by “nearly 50 percent” with most being economic-focused. In one national ad, the campaign claims that “American workers paid the price” for trade deals supported by Biden.

Trump on Tuesday denied he ever downplayed the risks of the coronavirus early this year, despite recorded evidence that he boasted of doing exactly that. Speaking with a small group of voters during an ABC News town hall program from Philadelphia, the president said, “I didn’t downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it, in terms of action. … My action was very strong.” The president used the television time to assail Biden as “grossly incompetent.” Trump was vague about how he is preparing for the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, saying his day job gives him plenty of practice. Biden on Tuesday told reporters he is preparing for the face-off with Trump by reviewing statements he’s made in the past. He indicated in his remarks that mock debate practice has not begun inside his campaign (The Associated Press).

> Biden went a courtin’: Biden made his first trip as the Democratic nominee to Florida on Tuesday as he makes a play to court Latino voters amid signs he is struggling to win over the bloc in a state that could make or break his 2020 chances.

As The Hill’s Jonathan Easley and Max Greenwood write, a Biden victory in the Sunshine State would all but close off any avenue for Trump to recapture the White House for a second term. However, recent polls show Biden running behind Clinton’s 2016 support among Latinos, raising concerns among Democrats that Biden’s potential weakness with a key demographic could help propel Trump to a win in Florida.

Biden attended a Hispanic Heritage Month event in Kissimmee, a city in Central Florida that is 60 percent Hispanic, on Tuesday evening and sat for an interview with Noticias Telemundo as part of his outreach to the key Democratic constituency with exactly seven weeks until Nov. 3.

Latinos are not the only group of voters Biden is making a renewed push to bring into his column. As The Hill’s Julia Manchester details, the former vice president is also making a concerted effort to court veterans, especially in the aftermath of reports by The Atlantic and other outlets detailing comments made by Trump in recent years.

On Tuesday, Biden met with veterans in Tampa, Fla., and offered yet another scathing rebuke of Trump’s reported comments disparaging fallen U.S. service members in the various stories.

“Donald Trump has no idea about the ideas that animate women and men who sign up to serve,” Biden said. “Duty, honor, country. That’s what service and patriotism is all about. … Nowhere are his faults more glaring and offensive to me at least, than when it comes to his denigration of our service members, veterans, wounded warriors, the fallen” (The Hill).

The Washington Post: Biden visits Florida as Democrats worry about his standing in the state.

Marc Caputo, Politico: “A heart pumping blue blood:” How fast-growing Orlando threatens Trump’s reelection.

Looking ahead, the former vice president will receive a briefing from public health experts in Wilmington, Del., about a COVID-19 vaccine and will deliver remarks at 2:30 p.m. on his plan to develop and distribute a vaccine if he becomes president in January.

On Thursday, Biden will take part in two notable events. Early in the day, he is expected to speak during a conference call with Senate Democrats, the first of its kind since he became the Democratic presidential nominee. The call is expected to focus on mobilizing voters in battleground states and helping elect candidates up and down the ballot for Democrats (Politico). The former VP is also slated to take part in a CNN town hall from his hometown of Scranton, Pa., at 8 p.m. (CNN).

LEADING THE DAY





CONGRESS: With a coronavirus relief deal remaining at large, Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided? Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.) said on Tuesday that the House will remain in session until an agreement between the two sides is reached amid calls by moderate Democrats for a bipartisan deal before Election Day.

Pelosi made the announcement during a conference-wide call, the first since the month-long August recess, as moderate Democrats push for the two sides to return to the table and strike an accord sooner rather than later.

“We have to stay here until we have a bill,” Pelosi told lawmakers.

According to The Hill’s Scott Wong and Mike Lillis, Pelosi, however, has refused to back down from her negotiating stance and says any deal will need to be on a package in excess of $2 trillion as Republicans continue to push for a bill no larger than $1.3 trillion or for a piecemeal approach to relief.

“A skinny bill is a Republican bill,” Pelosi said on the call.

The outcry from moderate members became intense as they continue to push for movement in talks. According to Politico, multiple Democrats who flipped GOP-held seats in 2018 and are facing tough contests in November pressed House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton HoyerDemocrats seek wave to bolster House majority Hoyer lays out ambitious Democratic agenda for 2021, with health care at top Top Democrats introduce resolution calling for mask mandate, testing program in Senate MORE (D-Md.) after Pelosi dropped off the call, including Reps.

Hoyer reiterated multiple times that he would not “undermine” Pelosi’s position in negotiations.

Adding to the pressure, the Problem Solvers Caucus, comprised of a bipartisan group of lawmakers, rolled out a $1.5 trillion proposal in a bid to restart talks that have been dormant since early August (The Hill).

However, Democratic leaders are sticking to their guns. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerDemocrats on edge as Biden-Trump fight nears end Reestablishing American prosperity by investing in the 'Badger Belt' House Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education MORE (D-N.Y.) said on Tuesday that he backs Pelosi’s stance in talks. Other rank-and-file Democrats also continue to back the position of party leaders, pointing to the need for any bill to include funding for state and local governments.

“There’s no way I can be for another bill that doesn’t backfill at least some of what states and cities like mine have lost in revenue since this COVID nightmare began.” Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) told The Morning Report.

That possibility is still unlikely to garner much GOP support. Tyler Goodspeed, acting chairman and vice chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told Bloomberg TV’s David Westin on Tuesday that the administration does not believe $1 trillion to support state and local budgets, passed by Democrats in May as part of a $3.4 trillion coronavirus bill, belongs “anywhere” in the ongoing conversations.

Despite the House remaining in session, lawmakers will be able to leave Washington and will be given a 24-hour heads up before any vote, which there is no guarantee of at this point.

The Washington Post: Pelosi says House will stay in session until new deal reached on economic relief.

A spokesman for Pelosi told The Hill that the possibility was discussed during a closed-door leadership meeting but no decision was made. A source familiar with the discussion said that House Democrats floated a clean continuing resolution (CR) into February. According to one House Democratic aide, “most Democrats prefer an end date in 2021,” although discussions are ongoing (The Hill).

The president previously denied he ever contemplated killing Assad, an anecdote reported in the book “Fear,” by Bob Woodward.

Barr’s willingness to boost Trump before the election when it comes to the origins of the FBI investigation into Russia’s interference with the 2016 election and the handling of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who admitted to lying to federal investigators before Barr and his team asked a judge to drop charges against him, concern some current and former department officials. They believe the department’s law enforcement independence has been undermined (The Washington Post).

> China: The Trump administration has less than a week to either accept Oracle’s proposed deal to become TikTok’s technology partner or move to shut down the wildly-popular short-form video app. The partnership that both companies submitted to the Treasury Department over the weekend seems to do little to address the concerns raised in Trump’s executive orders compelling divestiture from TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance. It also raises serious ethical concerns given Trump’s close ties with Oracle (The Hill). … A World Trade Organization (WTO) panel ruled Tuesday that the U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods are illegal, vindicating Beijing even if the United States has all but incapacitated the WTO’s ability to hand down a final, binding verdict.

LEADING THE DAY:

Former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE hit the virtual campaign trail in Florida on Thursday, highlighting the importance of the Sunshine State to the 2020 electoral map.

Biden took part in a virtual roundtable with African American leaders in Jacksonville, including Rep. Al Lawson Alfred (Al) James LawsonFlorida Democrat introduces bill to recognize Puerto Rico statehood referendum The Hill's Campaign Report: Biden's virtual campaign swings through Florida House approves bill banning flavored tobacco products MORE (D-Fla.), touching on a number of topics, including the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, an African-American man who was gunned down in February while jogging in Georgia by two armed white men. The former vice president told attendees at the roundtable that Arbery was “in a sense lynched before our very eyes.”

He also encouraged ""Medicare for All"" supporters to get behind his campaign, saying he was working with the movement's strongest proponents of the policy about developing strategies to expand health care coverage without as much spending from the federal government.

“For everyone who backed Medicare for All, join us,” he said.

Florida is shaping out to be a must-win state in November with its 29 electoral votes.

Polls show Biden leading Trump in Florida. The Real Clear Politics polling average shows Biden leading Trump by 3.2 points.

Trump won the state by roughly 1 point in 2016. He also has the advantage of a Republican governor in the state, Ron DeSantis Ron DeSantisCountdown to victory — but whose? Police called after Florida moms refuse to wear face masks at school board meeting about mask policy Officials: Florida man changed Gov. DeSantis's address, delaying him from voting MORE, who happens to be one of his staunchest supporters.

The contest in the Sunshine State could hinge in part on how the coronavirus plays out, and DeSantis’s handling of the crisis. The governor faced a mountain of criticism in March for not implementing a statewide stay-at-home order earlier. However, Florida has not become as much of a hot spot as other states such as New York, California and Michigan. This could bode well for Trump if DeSantis’s standing improves.

However, it’s unclear how the state would handle a second wave of the virus, which would happen closer to November. We’ll also be watching for the results of the state’s multiphased reopening plan, which began earlier this week. If the economy improves by November and there are a fewer cases, that will bode well for Trump. But a prolonged public health crisis could leave Florida voters asking for new leadership in the White House.

FROM THE TRAIL:

Trump’s reelection campaign released a new ad hitting Biden over his stance on China. The ad marks the latest effort from the president’s reelection campaign to paint Biden as too friendly toward China, including clips of Biden saying “They’re not bad folks, folks” and “The growth of China is overwhelmingly in our interest.” The Hill’s Tal Axelrod has more.

Rep. Alexandrio Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.) said in an interview with NPR that Tara Reade’s allegations of sexual assault against Biden are not “clear cut.”

Pompeo has defended his convention participation, saying he took part in his personal capacity and not as part of official business. He said his remarks were also cleared by lawyers at the State Department.

But Democrats have homed in on what they say is Pompeo’s obvious politicization of the State Department, arguing that his speech to the convention, recorded from Jerusalem and while on official diplomatic travel, was in violation of the Hatch Act and the secretary’s own State Department guidelines prohibiting staff from participating in partisan events.

They launched their own investigation in August over potential Hatch Act violations.

The OSC probe into Pompeo’s convention speech follows the revelation last week that the independent federal watchdog opened a case file into potential Hatch Act violations over Pompeo’s promise to release emails related to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE’s use of a private server.

“We’ll produce them when they are prepared to be produced,” Pompeo said in a briefing with reporters last week.

Democrats have also taken issue with Pompeo’s speeches to domestic audiences in key swing states weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential election, saying the secretary is stumping for Trump.

This includes a speech to the Wisconsin Legislature on Sept. 24 and a baptist church in Texas on Sept. 20. On Oct. 3, Pompeo delivered virtual remarks to the Florida Family Policy Council Gala, an anti-abortion Christian conservative organization. He had canceled attending the event in-person following an outbreak of COVID-19 in the White House that infected the president.

Democrats accuse Pompeo, who is a former Republican congressman from Kansas and considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate, as using his office to lay the groundwork for his future political ambitions.

“As we get closer to both this year’s election and his own inevitable return to electoral politics, Mike Pompeo has grown even more brazen in misusing the State Department and the taxpayer dollars that fund it as vehicles for the Administration’s, and his own, political ambitions,” Engel and Lowey said in their statement.

“The Department has repeatedly missed Congressional overseers’ deadlines for producing documents on his recent domestic speeches that will help us understand whether they were improper political activities. So we’re grateful to OSC—whom Mr. Pompeo can’t fire as he did the Inspector General—for looking into this matter.”

The State Department has defended Pompeo's domestic travel as communicating directly to the American people the mission of the State Department and Trump's foreign policy agenda.

Democrats are also investigating whether Pompeo’s push for the dismissal of the State Department’s inspector general Steve Linick in March amounted to an act of political retaliation. Linick was looking into whether Pompeo and his wife misused department resources for their own personal benefit, an investigation that is believed to be ongoing.

“The State Department has a legal obligation under the Federal Records Act to create and retain documentation of the Department’s actions, including by the Secretary and his inner circle,” Engel and Lowey wrote. “Congress has every right to review those official records. Whether it’s before Secretary Pompeo’s departure or afterwards, the truth about this administration’s corruption will come out.”",2020-10-26 11:23:38-04:00,

“Secretary Pompeo’s decision to make this speech appears to have violated long-standing prohibitions on Department employees’ participation in political activities and sends a message that the rules and standards that govern most Department employees don’t apply to the Department’s senior political appointee,” the Democratic chairpeople wrote in a letter to Shaw.

“The Secretary of State is our country’s top diplomat, responsible for representing all of America to the rest of the world, not the narrow interests of a particular president or of a single political party,"" they continued.

Pompeo delivered pre-recorded remarks to the GOP convention while on official diplomatic travel to Israel last month. He has defended his participation in the political event as occurring in his personal capacity and has further said the State Department cleared his actions as lawful.

“I did this in my personal capacity. All I can say in my role as secretary of State is the State Department reviewed this, it was lawful, and I personally felt it was important that the world hear the message of what this administration has accomplished,” Pompeo told reporters on Wednesday.

But his participation has drawn intense scrutiny and criticism from Democrats, who say his remarks to the event violated State Department guidelines prohibiting presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed officials from engaging in political events while on duty and abroad.

They further criticized whether taxpayer dollars were used related to the secretary’s participation in the political event.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Republican National Committee said that it would cover the cost of Pompeo’s participation in the event and the State Department said no taxpayer funds were used.

Engel and Lowey pointed out that taxpayer resources had likely been used for Pompeo’s flight to Israel, his lodging and security.

In addition to the OIG request, Democrats have launched their own investigation into Pompeo’s speech.

Phil Murphy says no coronavirus outbreaks in New Jersey linked to Trump fundraiser,"New Jersey Gov.

The announcement comes almost two weeks after Trump held a fundraiser at his golf club on Oct. 1, hours before he announced he’d tested positive for COVID-19. Officials quickly became concerned that the fundraiser would emerge as a superspreader event. Those fears spiked after numerous people who attended a later event at the White House tested positive for the coronavirus.

ADVERTISEMENT

The state government was forced to undergo a massive contact tracing operation after Trump’s announcement to get in touch with fundraiser attendees and workers, and Murphy later announced that the state opened an investigation into reports that the event “may not have compiled” with state coronavirus rules.

“As they say, the virus doesn't care who you are. New Jersey doesn’t care who you are — a group of folks from out of state coming in knowingly having been exposed to someone who is COVID-positive is really, really frustrating,” he told “CBS This Morning” after the event.

The Garden State is already grappling with a spike in coronavirus cases. Fueled by outbreaks linked to Orthodox Jewish communities in the state, New Jersey had nearly 1,000 new cases over the previous day, Murphy said Tuesday, a figure comparable to some of the worst days of the pandemic in May.

Hey @Malinowski and @RepRiggleman, I assume you're working late tonight putting together a resolution condemning Antifa and ""rejecting"" the violence they promote?



Antifa is no ""conspiracy theory."" #AntifaTerrorists & mdash; Marjorie Taylor Greene For Congress (@mtgreenee) October 10, 2020

Greene’s comments came after the fatal shooting of a man in Denver, with Greene claiming the shooter was a member of antifa. Denver police have said the shooter is not linked with the far-left movement.

Riggleman, who has publicly condemned antifa, responded to Greene by saying his “thoughts last night were w/ the family of the man killed,” adding that she shouldn’t “encourage those who are fact challenged-conspiracy theorists like those in #QAnon- or LEFT & RIGHT fringe groups.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Greene went on to accuse Riggleman of “parroting” Democratic talking points.

Riggleman then responded with a meme, telling Greene that “she may go now.”

She shot back by drawing attention to Riggleman's primary defeat earlier this year.

“I would say hopefully we can work well together in January, but it’s likely passing useless resolutions that don’t target the real threat are why you got primaried. Your meddling in my election didn’t hurt me either. America is ready for Republicans that fight back,” she tweeted.

Greene has previously voiced her support for QAnon, the baseless conspiracy theory that alleges there's a cabal of Democrats and global elites running an international child trafficking ring and attempting to control the government. She later attempted to distance herself from “Q,” stating that she no longer associates with it after finding “misinformation.""

But over the weekend she took aim at the bipartisan nonbinding resolution passed by the House, arguing that QAnon doesn’t pose a “real threat.”

The resolution, which passed in a 371-18 vote earlier this month, cited numerous examples of violence and criminal activity seen from QAnon supporters and calls for federal law enforcement and the FBI to allocate additional resources toward countering conspiracy-driven extremism.

Democrats go big on diversity with new House recruits,"Democrats have recruited one of their most diverse slate of candidates for a prized program that targets top flip opportunities across the country.

Of the 31 members of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s (DCCC) Red to Blue program, 26 are women and 12 are people of color. Earning a spot provides candidates with a boost, including extra attention from national Democrats and access to expanded resources and fundraising opportunities.

Wins by the recruits would add to what is already the most diverse House majority in history after Democrats took over the chamber in 2018 with a class that included Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOcasio-Cortez responds to Lindsey Graham debate swipe: You folded 'like a wet napkin' On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election Tlaib, Ocasio-Cortez offer bill to create national public banking system MORE (D-N.Y.) and Rep.

It also comes as protests against racial injustice and the #MeToo movement have become key issues in the lead-up to the election in November and after DCCC and Chairwoman Cheri Bustos Cheryl (Cheri) Lea BustosHouse Democrats run late ads defending vulnerable DCCC chair Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority GOP sees chance to take out Democratic House campaign chief MORE (D-Ill.) clashed last year with minority caucuses over the lack of diversity at the top ranks of the campaign arm of House Democrats.

“Diversifying our party is not just a top priority, it’s an ongoing priority,” said Bustos. “Our work means we can grow the historic diversity of our caucus, and it would not be possible without a DCCC staff and team that reflect the Democratic coalition we represent.”

The increased recruitment of diverse candidates comes after a cycles-long lobbying campaign by lawmakers, including those in the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, as well as top party leadership, to diversify the list.

Caucuses like the CBC and CHC have mainly focused on looking for minority candidates who were previously ignored by the national party.

Those efforts paid off in the 2018 midterms, which helped disprove the notion that candidates of color could only stand a chance in majority-minority districts.

The 2018 Red to Blue list also consisted of a slate of white candidates who now make up several of the House majority's frontline members, including Reps.

“As we continue our campaign efforts ahead of November, we refuse to lose sight of how we won 39 new seats in 2018, securing our Congressional majority and electing the most diverse class of House Democrats in history — these victories would not have been possible without the intentional diversification of our Committee’s investments in campaigns across America,” said Rep. Don McEachin (D-Va.), a co-chair of the Red to Blue program.

This year’s Red to Blue list is already more diverse than in 2018, when roughly half of the candidates were women and just over a fifth were candidates of color.

“We started to really see some success in this cycle, particularly given the last cycle and showing that if you put the resources behind these candidates who happen to be African American that they can win, and they can win no matter what the racial components of their districts are because they can represent anybody,” Rep. Gregory Meeks Gregory Weldon MeeksCedric Richmond's next move: 'Sky's the limit' if Biden wins Bottom line Democrats go big on diversity with new House recruits MORE (D-N.Y.), the chair of CBC's campaign arm, said in an interview.

“It does away with the theory,” he added, “that for an African American to be elected to Congress, they have to come from a district that was 60 percent African American.”

“This is a work in progress, but I’m pleased with where we’re at,” said Meeks of this year’s list.

The lion’s share of the Democrats included in the Red to Blue program are running in the same kinds of urban and suburban districts where the party found success in its 2018 wave, though some are running in more rural areas.

Among them are Georgia Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux running in Georgia’s 7th District. Bourdeaux, a professor, lost her race against Rep. Rob Woodall William (Rob) Robert WoodallBiden pushes into Trump territory Democrats, GOP fighting over largest House battlefield in a decade House Democrats' campaign arm reserves .6M in ads in competitive districts MORE (R) by about 400 votes in the Atlanta-area district two years ago. She is now running against Republican physician Rich McCormick after Woodall’s retirement, in a race rated as a “toss-up” by non-partisan political prognosticator The Cook Political Report.

Also on the list are five candidates in Texas, a state that is becoming increasingly competitive for Democrats. They include Sima Ladjevardian in a Houston-area district, former gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis in a district near San Antonio, Sri Kulkarni outside Houston, and Gina Ortiz Jones who is running for a border seat held by retiring Rep. Will Hurd William Ballard HurdMore veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority Trump predicts GOP will win the House MORE (R).

The DCCC made its most recent additions earlier this month when it placed six more women, including three women of color, on Red to Blue.

“Being on the Red-to-Blue list means my campaign is on a highly selective list of top-targeted races. This is a signal that Ohio voters are responding to our campaign as we build the infrastructure to flip this seat,” said Desiree Tims, who is challenging Rep.

Still, Democrats believe the party can do more to further diversify the party, especially after the clash at the DCCC last year that led to a major staff shakeup. Bustos back then acknowledged “mistakes” and that the group had “fallen short” on diversity among senior staff.

Some lawmakers are pushing to include more women and minority candidates, such as Ammar Campa-Najjar, the Democrat running against former Rep. Darrell Issa Darrell Edward IssaChamber-backed Democrats embrace endorsements in final stretch Ex-RNC, Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy charged in covert lobbying scheme DCCC reserves new ad buys in competitive districts, adds new members to 'Red to Blue' program MORE (R) in California’s 50th District, which was represented by former Rep.

Campa-Najjar, who is of Mexican and Palestinian descent, narrowly lost against Hunter in 2018 and has proven to be a strong fundraiser in 2020, raking in $700,000 in the second quarter of the year. He is backed by BOLD PAC, the CHC’s campaign arm, which is pushing for Campa-Najjar to also be included in Red to Blue.

“Ammar's efforts have made CA-50 a battleground district and that's why BOLD PAC will continue to encourage the DCCC to add Ammar to Red to Blue. He’s earned it. When we stand behind candidates who can win, the American people win. Ammar has proven he has what it takes to flip this seat,” Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who chairs the CHC’s campaign arm, told The Hill.

Republicans have also made efforts to diversify their party, pointing out that of the 21 candidates currently the equivalent Young Guns program, 12 are women and 6 are members of a minority group.

GOP officials also hit Democratic candidates as being too liberal for the country.

“The DCCC's idea of diversity seems to be recruiting both cop-hating Marxists and run of the mill socialists to run for House seats,"" NRCC spokesman Bob Salera said.

But Democrats tout they have a far more diverse caucus and crop of candidates, which they believe is critical at a time when events such as the death of George Floyd have sparked nationwide protests against racial injustice.

Of the 31 candidates in the Red to Blue program alone, all but three of them are looking to unseat or replace white lawmakers who are either running for reelection or retiring.

“The whole world is looking at what is taking place right now. So it is significantly important both nationally and internationally, I think, and it will help us to regain the leadership that we need on a national and international level as we deal with racial disparities,” Meeks said.",2020-08-02 08:00:07-04:00,
Stand-alone bill to provide relief for airlines blocked on House floor,"House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio Peter Anthony DeFazioDemocrats, GOP fighting over largest House battlefield in a decade Trump says talks on COVID-19 aid are now 'working out' Trump gambles with new stimulus strategy MORE (D-Ore.) attempted to pass a stand-alone bill that would give relief to airlines on the House floor Friday.

The attempt was unsuccessful after the Oregon congressman was denied a request for unanimous consent, which would preclude the need for members to participate in a recorded vote. His bill would extend the airline Payroll Support Program (PSP) by six months.

“The Republican minority killed this legislation, plain and simple. If they had just agreed, tens of thousands of workers for the airlines — flight attendants, they don’t get paid a heck of a lot of money, pilots, yeah they do well, mechanics, gate agents — tens of thousands of those people have been furlough as of yesterday,” DeFazio said on the House floor.

PSP, which allocated $25 billion in aid for airlines, was part of the massive $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March. As a condition for accepting the relief, it prohibited airlines from laying off employees until Oct. 1.

“They’ve lost their jobs, they’ve lost their health care, some of them are going to lose their homes. They don’t know how they’re going to make ends meet, feed their kids or do anything else, all because the Republicans in the House of Representatives would not agree and the Republicans in the Senate will not agree to a larger package, which contains these provisions. These are vital provisions, they’re time sensitive,” DeFazio said.

The House passed another $2.2 trillion coronavirus aid package on Thursday that has been rejected by Republicans in the Senate and White House. It included $25 billion to extend the PSP.

“I’m tired of bureaucracy around here. It’s time to do real things for the American people and this is real, these peoples’ lives are at stake,” DeFazio said, in a heated response to his time being up on the floor.

Kendra Horn Kendra Suzanne HornDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts Biden's oil stance jars Democrats in tough races Biden: 'I would transition from the oil industry' MORE (D-Okla.), who was presiding over the House, said DeFazio’s request could not be entertained because it was not cleared by leadership from both sides of the aisle.

Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.) told airlines to hold off on the furloughs because Congress would either pass DeFazio's stand-alone legislation or relief would come in the form of a negotiated bill.

Following the blockage of DeFazio's bill on the floor, Pelosi called Republicans’ objection to his legislation disappointing.



“Again and again, Democrats offer legislation to save lives and livelihoods, only to be met by more Republican obstruction. Either Republicans are not serious about meeting the staggering health and economic challenge facing our nation, or they do not care,” she said in a statement.

“Democrats will continue our efforts to provide direly-needed relief for airline workers.”

A House GOP aide said the Republicans are still waiting for details on the DeFazio bill and pointed to a bill they support that was introduced by Del.

On Wednesday, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker told employees that the process of furloughing 19,000 employees has started, and United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told employees they are moving forward with furloughing about 13,000.

Both CEOs, though, left the door open to reversing the furlough process if a deal is reached in the coming days.

Industry group Airlines for America (A4A) thanked DeFazio for his continuing efforts to save these airline jobs in a statement on Friday.

""We understand that negotiations are continuing. We therefore implore members of Congress and the Administration to work swiftly to reach agreement and extend PSP. Time already ran out, but several U.S. airlines have said that they may be able to turn back the clock and reinstate employees IF they receive direct payroll assistance from the federal government within a matter of days,"" A4A CEO Nicholas Calio said in a statement.",2020-10-02 15:20:26-04:00,
Moderate Democrats push leadership to pull marijuana legislation,"Centrist Democrats are pushing House Democratic leadership to pull legislation expected to reach the House floor next week that would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level.

The Democrats are expressing frustrations the bill is slated to come to come up for a vote before other pressing matters.

Specifically, a number of front-line members have raised concerns about the optics of holding a vote on the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act before a coronavirus stimulus package and a government funding bill are passed.

Negotiators have struggled for months to strike a deal on additional coronavirus relief, with the parties remaining at an impasse over funding levels. Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass funding to avert a government shutdown.

""At a time when people are really struggling just to pay the bills and to get through this health crisis, [COVID relief] should be our priority,"" said centrist Rep. Scott Peters Scott H. PetersTrump's illness sparks new urgency for COVID-19 deal Moderate Democrats push leadership to pull marijuana legislation One doctor's thoughts on a hopeful future MORE (D-Calif.). He said he's suggested to Democratic leaders that the marijuana bill is ""probably something I would support but we should do it later on.""

Another member said colleagues have argued that “it's not something that you can get passed into law,” so it shouldn’t be prioritized over more time-sensitive issues.

Moderate Democrats have been up in arms that party leaders have signaled an intention to vote on the marijuana bill this month, just weeks before the elections when many vulnerable lawmakers are scrambling to keep their seats.

""This is the month when the Democratic Caucus is giving its closing arguments to the American people about what their priorities are and how they're going to govern. And prioritizing weed smokers over funding the government and providing relief to families and small businesses doesn't make much sense to the American people,"" said a senior Democratic aide associated with the moderate wing of the party.

""There are some policy concerns with the bill itself — the bill goes far beyond legalizing marijuana,"" the aide added. ""But that is ultimately the main concern, is the timing of this.""

Another senior Democratic aide said that moderates are making their concerns known to leadership.

“The priority should be legislation that helps individuals and families deal with the effects of the ongoing pandemic, not this bill,” the aide said.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton HoyerDemocrats seek wave to bolster House majority Hoyer lays out ambitious Democratic agenda for 2021, with health care at top Top Democrats introduce resolution calling for mask mandate, testing program in Senate MORE (D-Md.) suggested Tuesday morning that he has heard those concerns loud and clear, saying that while he supports the marijuana proposal, Democratic leaders will be prioritizing the continuing resolution (CR) and COVID-19 relief in the days and weeks ahead. He did not commit to voting on the MORE Act.

""We are really focused on a CR and on the COVID-19, which are the two critical pieces of legislation within this three-week period we have to pass,"" Hoyer said on a press call. ""I'm a supporter of the MORE Act, but we've got to get the CR and COVID-19 done because they're absolutely critical to the welfare of our country.""

But supporters of bringing the legislation to the floor argue the lack of a COVID-19 relief bill should not derail other priorities.

""I know there's some people are saying they don't want to vote on the one unless we pass a stimulus first — I don't think that they go together,” one Democratic lawmaker told The Hill, noting it has garnered support from members on both sides of the aisle.

House panel approves measure requiring masks on public transport,"The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday approved a measure requiring passengers and workers on major public transportation to wear masks for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Masks have become a key method of preventing the coronavirus from spreading, but have also become deeply politicized, though the tides have begun to shift.

In recent weeks, Republican governors such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott who previously shunned masks and blocked local mandates have done about faces as COVID-19 cases surged in their states.

The dueling ABC and NBC programs featuring voter and moderator questions were in lieu of a planned debate in Florida on Thursday that was canceled because Trump objected to coronavirus precautions requested by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Instead, the candidates blasted each other from a distance, but Trump turned combative while Biden was eagerly earnest on live TV. Both candidates are scheduled to appear together during a socially distanced debate on Thursday in Nashville, Tenn.

Trump, sweating on a warm outdoor NBC set in Miami, repeated many of the boasts and explanations he’s used for months to champion his much-criticized handling of the coronavirus crisis. He repeated his view that his decision in January to close U.S. borders to travelers from China saved “thousands and thousands of lives.”

“I knew it was a big threat,” the president said of the virus he has downplayed for nine months. Pressed by moderator Savannah Guthrie to explain why he resisted scientific advice to urge mask-wearing to help save many more lives from COVID-19 infection, Trump bristled, saying, “I was OK with it. … I say ‘wear the mask,’ I have no problem with it.”

In Philadelphia, meanwhile, Biden, a mask in his hand, told one woman questioner that he would consider as president mandating a future COVID-19 vaccine, depending on its effectiveness, safety and the duration of the protection it provided. He said he would try to mandate mask-wearing by using the power of the Oval Office to encourage mayors, governors, local officials and businesses to require them. “A president’s words matter,” the former vice president said when asked by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos George Robert StephanopoulosCampaign adviser predicts Trump will win more than 290 electoral votes Senior adviser points to vaccine when pressed on Trump's comments about 'rounding the corner' on pandemic Adviser says Biden campaign officials 'feel very good about our pathways to victory' MORE to explain how a mask mandate could be enforced.

Queried about the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Biden offered a tangled explanation about why he thought the 1994 law was both well intentioned at the time and also a “mistake” in hindsight because of the lifelong consequences of imprisonment and criminal records within communities of color. “Things have changed a lot,” he said, describing his recognition of the damage, his support for community policing and his desire to create a task force, if elected, of stakeholders to recommend changes to improve racial justice and police reforms.

The Hill: Biden says crime bill was “mistake” during ABC town hall.

Trump, asked about his second-term plan for Dreamers and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program, tried to sidestep his administration’s desire to revoke while speaking in South Florida to voters who know the subject well.

“We are going to take care of DACA, of Dreamers. It’s working right now,” he said before changing the subject to boast about a wall being built at the southern border with Mexico. “We are working very hard on the DACA program,” he persisted when Guthrie reminded him that the administration curtailed the program created during the Obama administration to offer deferred enforcement for young undocumented immigrants. The Trump administration sought to revoke the program but was blocked by the Supreme Court. “What happened was the pandemic,” the president replied, inaccurately.

Biden had his own uncomfortable exchange about his view of expanding the Supreme Court beyond nine justices if he’s elected. After agreeing with a voter’s question that he believes a more conservative court puts LGBTQ rights and the Affordable Care Act in jeopardy, Biden, when pressed by Stephanopoulos, said he will tell voters before Nov. 3 if he would support working with Congress to expand the number of justices.

“I have not been a fan of court packing,” he said, displaying frustration that his reluctance to buck members of his party on the question leaves him open to pressure from Trump, Republicans and the news media to tell voters what he would do. “It depends on how this turns out,” Biden said, referring to how Senate Republicans “handle” the upcoming committee and floor votes scheduled this month on the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett Amy Coney BarrettThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law If it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Pittsburgh newspaper backs Trump in first GOP presidential endorsement since 1972 MORE.

LEADING THE DAY

SCOTUS: The Senate Judiciary Committee wrapped up four days of hearings and set a vote next Thursday to send the nomination of Barrett to the full Senate to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court (The Associated Press).

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.) said Republicans have the votes to confirm Barrett before the end of the month. ""She'll come out of committee next Thursday ... and we'll go to the floor with her on Friday the 23rd and stay on it until we finish,"" he said. ""We have the votes"" (The Hill).

The Senate confirmed Barrett in 2017 to be an appeals court judge by a vote of 55-43. Republican Sens.

Collins, who is seeking reelection, has said she will vote no for that reason. Murkowski says she’s open to confirming Barrett before Election Day (National Review).

This week’s committee hearings, during which Barrett declined to respond to questions and sidestepped nearly every public policy debate of the era, shaped up into a proxy for the upcoming elections, The Hill’s Jordain Carney reports. Republican senators used the judge’s nomination to warn that Democrats will try to expand the number of justices on the Supreme Court in 2021 if they’re in control. Democrats used GOP court challenges to the Affordable Care Act as a pre-Nov. 3 warning that a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court backed by Trump and a Republican-controlled Senate would try to take away affordable insurance and protections from 20 million Americans.

The New York Times: Hours of questions, few answers: What we learned about Barrett.

One of the many issues the judge, 48, tried to dodge during her 18 hours of testimony was climate change. Environmentalists interpreted her comments as betraying some skepticism about whether global warming is manmade and scientifically proven to be a planetary crisis. Critics of her nomination said her comments should disqualify her to join the high court (The Hill). Barrett observed that climate change is a “contentious matter of public debate,” telling Harris in response to a question, “I will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially one that is politically controversial” (The Hill).







IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES

MORE (or Less) CONGRESS: The president on Thursday opened the door to once again increasing the White House’s coronavirus relief offer, only to see Senate Republicans pour cold water over the possibility of supporting any comprehensive proposal in the coming weeks.

“Absolutely, I would. I would pay more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday. Go big or go home,” Trump told Fox Business in a phone interview on Thursday morning.

Trump, without specifying a dollar amount, said that he had directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinDemocrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Trump, Biden set for weekend swing state sprint Mnuchin says he learned of Pelosi's letter to him about stimulus talks 'in the press' MORE to increase the offer to Democratic negotiators, but noted that Mnuchin ""hasn’t come home with the bacon.”

However, the president lobbed criticism in the direction of Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided? Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.) for her handling of negotiations, reiterating that her stance on funding for state and local governments amounts to a “bail out.” In the latest offer, the White House is offering $300 billion for states and cities, compared to $436 billion in the Democratic offer.

“She is asking for all sorts of goodies. She wants to bail out badly run Democrat states and cities. She wants money for things that you would never, you just couldn’t, just your pride couldn’t let it happen,” Trump said (The Hill).

Trump’s push for a “big” deal, however, is running into an intra party roadblock as McConnell said on Thursday that he does not plan on bringing any potential agreement between Mnuchin and Pelosi to the floor at the current price tag levels. The latest White House offer totals $1.8 trillion, while Democrats are sticking at $2.2 trillion.

“I don’t think so. That’s where the administration is willing to go. My members think half a trillion dollars, highly targeted, is the best way to go,"" McConnell said, pointing to his plan to force a vote next week on a $500 billion bill that would include an increase in funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. “That's not what I'm going to put on the floor,” he added, referring to the current proposals by the White House and Democrats (The Hill).

The Washington Post: Trump again upends stimulus strategy, complaining that Mnuchin hasn’t “come home with the bacon.”

Roll Call: Trump wants bigger coronavirus relief package; GOP support tepid.

> Trump vs. Pelosi: With the two sides continuing to haggle over a coronavirus stimulus package, negotiations have repeatedly taken place between Pelosi and Mnuchin, with Trump weighing in on Twitter or during interviews. In fact, Trump and the Speaker have not spoken in exactly a year, highlighting the level of dysfunction between the two most powerful people in Washington.

As The Hill’s Cristina Marcos notes, the two party leaders rarely let a moment go by without exhibiting intense disdain for the other one, let alone coming together to strike a deal. Their last face-to-face meeting on Oct. 16, 2019, resulted in Pelosi and Trump unable to agree on whether he called her a ""third-rate"" or ""third grade"" politician and the Speaker saying afterward that people should pray for the president's health. Since then, the two have gone further down the gutter, with Trump questioning Pelosi’s mental acuity, and the Speaker at one point labeling Trump “morbidly obese.”

Forty-four states and the District of Columbia have higher caseloads than in mid-September. Wisconsin set a record Thursday when it surpassed 4,000 newly reported cases. Illinois also reported more than 4,000 cases, eclipsing records set during the state’s first wave in April and May. Ohio set a new high, as did Indiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Montana and Colorado. In El Paso, officials have ordered new restrictions and lockdowns amid a coronavirus surge (The Washington Post).

House members race to prepare for first-ever remote votes,"House lawmakers are bustling to prepare for the chamber’s historic first remote votes this week, with a race on for members to secure proxies, who are limited to representing 10 colleagues each.

Within 48 hours, Rep. Don Beyer, a Northern Virginia Democrat whose commute to the Capitol is only about a 15-minute drive, had already received nearly the maximum number of requests from colleagues asking if he could serve as their proxy.

Beyer said Friday that he had already agreed to serve as a proxy for nine others, leaving him only one slot to spare.

“It's too bad that we have to have this, but it’s my pleasure to be able to do it for my friends. I know they really want to participate. They want to be on the record,” Beyer told The Hill. “It seems a lot better than just not being able to do the people's work or putting a bunch of people at grave risk.”

Democrats reject that argument and point to legal precedent determining that each chamber of Congress has discretion over how to conduct its proceedings.

“Remote voting by proxy is fully consistent with the Constitution and more than a century of legal precedent, including Supreme Court cases, that make clear that the House can determine its own rules,” Pelosi said in a statement.

Furthermore, there is historical precedent for proxy voting in House and Senate committees. Proxy voting in House committees was used until Republicans under then-Speaker Newt Gingrich Newton (Newt) Leroy GingrichMORE (R-Ga.) ended it in the 1990s, but the practice is still allowed in Senate committees.

The House is setting a new precedent, however, in allowing proxy voting on the floor.

Under the new rules, members voting by proxy must provide exact written instructions for each vote, including any unexpected procedural votes. The votes of lawmakers voting by proxy will also be announced from the floor during each vote.

“Perhaps if in the next hundred years there's another crisis, we'll have precedent and know how to go forward,” Beyer said.

The 14 Democrats who broke with their party on coronavirus relief vote,"House Democrats on Friday passed their latest coronavirus stimulus package — a massive $3 trillion bill with $1 trillion for state and local governments, hundreds of billions of dollars for medical equipment and testing, an expansion of unemployment benefits, and another round of direct cash payments for struggling Americans.

Democrats have dubbed the bill the HEROES Act, a nod to the people working on the front lines against the pandemic.

The 208-199 vote was largely along party lines, though more than a dozen lawmakers broke with their parties, including 14 Democrats and one Republican, Rep. Peter King (N.Y.), who explained his position earlier this week.

""While this legislation includes critical assistance for Iowa’s hospitals, schools, homeowners and renters, state and local governments, and families who are still feeling the burdens of this public health crisis – I am deeply troubled by numerous provisions in this bill that could see large amounts of taxpayer dollars allocated to helping those who are not hurting at all,"" Axne said.

Cunningham, in his first term, expressed his displeasure with the HEROES Act, describing it as ""Washington politics at its worst.""

""Congress has an obligation to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars,"" he said. ""American small businesses, families, and our state and local governments urgently need more aid, but it must be targeted -- especially when we are discussing spending trillions of dollars.

""The partisan nature and wide scope of this bill makes it doomed upon arrival in the Senate — only further delaying the aid that Kansans desperately need,"" Davids said. ""Instead we should use these measures as the foundation for a bipartisan relief package that delivers real solutions to the urgent challenges Kansans face in the wake of this public health crisis.

“The next federal COVID-19 relief package must be focused on helping families, workers, small businesses and local governments,"" she said. ""It needs bipartisan buy-in, and should not be tied up with unrelated provisions. I came to Washington to get things done, and this legislation only serves to push real relief further down the road.""

Jared Golden (Maine)

Golden called the decision to vote against the HEROES Act ""difficult,"" saying that he supported many aspects of the bill.

""By significantly expanding the scope of the legislation beyond core, urgent needs and insisting on the inclusion of a series of unrelated provisions, House leaders missed the opportunity to make bipartisan progress on these issues,"" Golden said. ""Our communities desperately need relief, but this bill moves us no closer to delivering that relief.""

""In response to COVID-19, our relief efforts must be targeted, timely, and transparent,"" Horn said. ""The HEROES Act does not meet those standards. To deliver timely relief, we must put aside proposals that lack bipartisan public support and work to negotiate a legislative package that can pass both houses of Congress and earn the support of the White House.""

Pramila Jayapal (Wash.)

Jayapal, co-chairwoman of the Progressive Congressional Caucus (PCC), released a statement before the vote Friday saying that she would be voting no on the HEROES Act.

""At the core, our response from Congress must match the true scale of this devastating crisis. The Heroes Act—while it contains many important provisions—simply fails to do that,"" she said, adding that the bill ""does not keep workers in their jobs and guarantee the certainty of paychecks.""

Jayapal was the only member of the PCC to vote against the bill, though nine other PCC lawmakers did not vote.

Conor Lamb (Pa.)

Lamb, 35, said that lawmakers needed to work harder to find ""common ground"" when crafting legislation to help Americans during the pandemic.

""People in western Pennsylvania and all over the country have sacrificed a lot during this crisis. They expect us to put politics aside, work together, and focus on defeating the coronavirus,"" Lamb said. ""This bill is not focused, it was rushed to a vote too fast, and it doesn’t help us accomplish that core mission.""

""Congress has a responsibility to work together to deliver results, especially during a public health emergency and an economic crisis,"" she said. ""A spending bill of this magnitude must be approached in a bipartisan manner and utilize a transparent process where Democrats and Republicans come together to identify the most impactful solutions.""

Ben McAdams (Utah)

McAdams called the bill a partisan ""wish-list,"" saying that too many provisions in the HEROES Act strayed from the actual goal of helping the country.

""At a time when thousands of people are sick, millions are out of work, and small businesses face bankruptcy, we should be laser-focused on a strategy that opens up business and gets people back to work while also addressing the public health crisis caused by this virus,"" McAdams said.

“Due to the Department’s obstruction, the Committee’s only available avenue to obtain an accurate understanding of the Department’s role in the Dream Center collapse is to pursue depositions of the knowledgeable Department officials under subpoena,” Scott wrote. “The Committee will continue its oversight of this matter with the goal of getting answers about Dream Center’s collapse.”

Department of Education press secretary Angela Morabito said in a statement to The Hill that it is “wholly unreasonable to subpoena civil servants in this case,” and added that the committee has refused to review the documents it has sent.

“Yet, instead of conducting business in a lawful, rational, and responsible way, the unhinged Democrats have resorted to badgering career civil servants to carry on what is nothing more than a witch hunt,” Morabito said.

Dream Center finalized the acquisition of its schools from Education Management in 2018. As part of the acquisition, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) downgraded the accreditation of two Art Institute campuses for a period of time.

The Commission told Dream Center in January 2018 to inform its students that the two schools were no longer accredited, the committee's report states. It says the Dream Center instead waited until June that year to give notice. Students still kept enrolling in the school during that time.

The Department of Education still provided students with loans despite the school not being accredited. To circumvent the issue, it declared the schools to be nonprofit institutions in May 2018, and made this effective as of January 2018, the day the schools lost accreditation. Jones then tried to convince the HLC to back-date the accreditation of the schools during that time, the Democrats charge.",2020-10-22 17:27:25-04:00,

TALK OF THE MORNING



The question we are all wondering — do we really have to do this two more times…?:

The Biden campaign is insisting that the presidential debates will continue, even after the raucous event last night that commentators have called a “dumpster fire.” https://bit.ly/36kapk0

Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told reporters that Biden will still attend the next two debates: ""I don’t know how many different ways we can say it. Yes, we are going to do the debates.”

She continued: ""I would imagine there will be some additional conversations [with the Commission on Presidential Debates]. But yeah, we are committing to attending the debates.”

Put Workers First, Extend Payroll Support

Pilots — and the millions who rely on the airline industry directly or indirectly for employment — are counting on America’s leaders to extend the Payroll Support Program before Sept. 30. See why.





FROM FIGHT NIGHT NO. 1

Fox News’s Chris Wallace moderated the first presidential debate last night between President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE and Democratic presidential nominee Biden, a brawl characterized by its interruptions, mudslinging, name-calling and raised voices.

The gist of the debate:

Hyperlink https://bit.ly/2Gfxtpf

Why last night's debate mattered so much: The New York Times’s Shane Goldmacher tweeted, “One reason last night's debate matters: Millions of Americans are expected to vote between now and the next time Trump and Biden debate on October 15.” https://bit.ly/349IWi5





TAKEAWAYS:

Trump missed a chance: “Trump’s constant interruptions, of both Biden and moderator Chris Wallace, were at once disjointed and unfocused, a fusillade of assaults that failed to damage his rival.”

Biden kept his cool: “For months, Democratic strategists have worried that Biden would lose his cool and fall prey to Trump’s baiting — especially when it came to his son, Hunter Biden.”

Biden’s to-camera strategy: “The contrast between where each of the two candidates kept their eyes was startling. Trump, leaning on his podium, watched his prey, preparing to pounce at every opportunity. Biden repeatedly turned to the camera to address the voters watching at home.”

The debate is unlikely to change many minds: “Tuesday’s tangle will shrink the pool of undecided voters, but not to a substantial degree.”

Will there be another debate?: “The answer appears to be yes, though there was chatter at the debate's conclusion that raised questions.”

Details for each from The Hill’s Reid Wilson: https://bit.ly/3kXjenO

How Fox News’s Chris Wallace struggled to keep order to the debate: https://bit.ly/36jhlhb





DEBATE HIGHLIGHTS:

Trump refused to denounce white supremacy: “Proud Boys — stand back and stand by,” Trump said. https://bit.ly/2GmBOGW

The snarky kid in class with all the comments to the teacher: “Chris Wallace: ‘Mr. President, I am the moderator of this debate, and I'd like you to let me ask my question’"" https://bit.ly/34aZ5DZ

Biden on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee: ""I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person, but she's written before she went on the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional."" https://bit.ly/36hNyp7

This is an effective talking point: Biden asked, ""How many of you woke up this morning and had an empty kitchen chair because someone died of COVID?"" https://bit.ly/3n8k0Au





THE INSULTS WERE FLYING:

Biden on Trump’s presidency: “You’re the worst president America has ever had.”

Trump questioned Biden’s intellect: “He was the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me,” Trump said to Biden. “Because you know what, there’s nothing smart about you, Joe.” https://reut.rs/3l2ThU6 Video of the exchange: https://bit.ly/30hppLp

Biden said to Trump: “Will you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential.”





SIGHTS AND SOUNDS:

What it was like in the debate hall: “A bit of laughter from the back of the room when Biden sarcastically remarks about the productivity of the first 15 minutes of the debate. It's the only reaction so far, other than Wallace's continued attempts to keep some control here.” (Via The Wall Street Journal’s Michael C. Bender) https://bit.ly/2HzskIX

Interesting observation about masks: Bloomberg’s Tyler Pager noticed, “Everyone in Biden’s side of the hall is wearing a mask. More than half on Trump’s side, including his four children, are not wearing masks. According to the Cleveland Clinic, it’s a requirement that all guests wear masks.” https://bit.ly/347sYFq

Sanders is headed for a top finish in California and Texas, the two largest states to vote. The progressive independent should win California in blowout fashion, and he’s maintained a healthy lead in polls of Texas throughout the early voting period, when more than 1 million people cast ballots in the Democratic primary.

Centrist Democrats are frantically throwing their weight behind Biden in an effort to keep Sanders from building an insurmountable lead.

Biden’s best-case scenario involves a sweep in the South, where voters in Alabama, Arkansas and Tennessee will be casting ballots.

But those victories are not guaranteed, particularly with former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg on the ballot for the first time. Sanders is running at or near the top of the polls in Virginia and North Carolina, where Biden needs to do well.

“No question, Bernie will still be the front-runner after Super Tuesday, he’ll have the most delegates,” said one Democrat who has raised money for Biden. “Biden’s entire plan is to win where he can, mostly in the South, and come in second in other places. Anything that keeps the delegates math close is a win for Biden right now.”

It’s unclear whether the hundreds of millions of dollars Bloomberg has spent on a national ad campaign will translate into hard votes on Tuesday.

Texas could be a key swing state. Sanders has led the polls but recent surveys show rising support for Biden, despite competition from Bloomberg.

“Bernie has cleared the left and now Joe has cleared the center, nobody needed a well-meaning Republican billionaire to come in and save the party, we’re doing it ourselves,” said Howard Gutman, a former Obama administration ambassador who supports Biden. “Bloomberg ought to get out today. Every vote he takes from Joe is a vote for Donald Trump.”

Warren faces a must-win contest in her home state of Massachusetts. Sanders is looking to slam the door shut on her there, drawing thousands to rallies across the Bay State over the weekend.

But Warren has the resources to stick around, raising nearly $30 million in February after taking down Bloomberg at the Las Vegas debate. Warren’s campaign has stated its intention to stay in the race through the convention, hoping she can prevail there if no other candidate wins a majority of delegates.

“Our grassroots campaign is built to compete in every state and territory and ultimately prevail at the national convention in Milwaukee,” campaign manager Roger Lau said in an email to supporters.

Sanders is feeling pressure to win outright before the convention.

While the political world buzzed about Biden’s comeback, Sanders rolled on, announcing a $46 million February cash haul and drawing 25,000 people to rallies in Los Angeles and San Jose, Calif.

The FiveThirtyEight model shows a tightening race, with Sanders and Biden effectively forecast to split the 14 states up for grabs.

Polls in North Carolina and Virginia point to a close contest, with Sanders or Biden positioned to win depending on how late-breaking voters decide.

Sanders’s allies are confident. They say early voting and their candidate’s strategically smart campaign will lead to victories. Sanders has been harvesting mail-in ballots from the thousands who have attended his rallies in California to deliver them in bulk to county registrars ahead of Election Day.

“Bernie has already locked in a strong showing and will most likely win the largest basket of delegates, not just because of the millions of votes already cast in early voting before South Carolina, but because of the campaign organizing that has been working exceptionally hard for many months, an infrastructure that no amount of South Carolina momentum can overcome,” said Jonathan Tasini, a progressive strategist and Sanders supporter.

Still, momentum has swung sharply in Biden’s direction since South Carolina.

After struggling to raise money for the past year, the Biden campaign pulled in an astonishing $5 million in the 24 hours after his South Carolina victory.

Establishment and centrist Democrats are rallying behind Biden’s campaign, boosting his case as the strongest alternative to Sanders.

“The race has always been Bernie versus Joe, it’s just been a lot of noise getting here,” said Gutman. “The question is whether the center wins out or the left. If the center holds, Joe is the guy.”

“This is completely unprecedented,” said Andrew Feldman, a Democratic strategist. “It’s why the idea of a brokered convention doesn’t seem out of the realm of possibility. We just have to wait and see.”",2020-03-03 06:00:31-05:00,

LEADING THE DAY:

Buzz is growing around Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenA wave election? Or a fundamental realigning of American politics? Why it's time for a majority female Cabinet Warren has expressed interest in being Biden's Treasury secretary: report MORE's (D) prospects as former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s running mate.

The Hill’s Jonathan Easley reported on Thursday that Stanley Greenberg, one of the Democratic Party’s top pollsters, gave a presentation earlier this month to senior members of Biden’s campaign making the case that Warren would provide the most upside as a vice presidential candidate.

The 14-deck slide presented by Greenberg detailed how Biden will need to grow his support among young people and Democrats who did not vote for him during the primary if he’s going to defeat President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE in November.

The presentation warned that the biggest threat Democrats face in 2020 is the “lack of support and disengagement of millennials and the fragmentation of non-Biden primary voters.”

Greenberg concluded that the intensity of support around Warren’s messages opposing Washington corruption and denouncing the economy as rigged against the middle class would help Biden win over those remaining persuadable voters.

""Senator Warren is the obvious solution,” Greenberg concluded in the presentation.

Those findings were backed up by a Morning Consult-Politico survey released Wednesday that found a plurality of Democrats declaring they would be more likely to vote for Biden in November if he chose Warren as his running mate.

The Hill’s Amie Parnes and Alexander Bolton reported on Thursday that Warren is in regular contact with Biden. She plans to hold a big online fundraiser for him in June and has been sending other signals about her eagerness to join his team.

One big potential obstacle: Massachusetts is governed by Republican Charlie Baker, who could replace her with a new GOP senator until a special election takes place in 2021.

That means Democrats might be down a seat in the Senate in the early days of a potential Biden administration, which could prove costly given how close the battle for the Senate is lining up to be.

FROM THE TRAIL:

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said Thursday that Republican officials have not submitted the proposal requested by his office to detail how they plan to handle health risks at the planned Aug. 24 national convention, raising questions about whether Trump will go through with his threat to pull the convention out of the state. Jonathan reports.

Biden is hoping to decide on a running mate by Aug. 1, a little more than two weeks before the Democratic National Convention. That tracks with the timeline the former vice president previously laid out. He has said that the vetting process should be complete by July and that a final decision will come shortly after that. Jonathan reports.

Federal Election Commission (FEC) commissioner Ellen Weintraub warned on Thursday that President Trump’s claims that mail-in voting comes with an increased risk of fraud threaten to “undermine the American people’s faith in our democracy.” She also wrote that ""there's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud. None."" The Hill’s Justin Wise reports.

FROM CONGRESS & THE STATES:

The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Wednesday approved a plan to send absentee ballot applications to more than 2.7 million registered voters, in a move that comes as Trump continues to attack mail-in ballots as leading to fraud. Justin reports.

Everytown for Gun Safety rolled out its first round of House endorsements on Thursday, committing to double down on its effort to protect what it has dubbed a “gun sense majority” in the lower chamber. The 58 endorsements, which were released exclusively to The Hill’s Julia Manchester, mark the first round of the group’s $60 million electoral program.

House chairman asks Secret Service for briefing on COVID-19 safeguards for agents,"House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson Bennie Gordon ThompsonHouse Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education Long-shot Espy campaign sees national boost in weeks before election House chairman asks Secret Service for briefing on COVID-19 safeguards for agents MORE (D-Miss.) said Monday that he has requested a briefing from the Secret Service on its safeguards for agents exposed to COVID-19, a day after President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE left his hospital suite while undergoing treatment for the virus to greet supporters from his motorcade, putting his protective detail at risk of exposure.

Trump, who is currently undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, waved to supporters from inside a Chevrolet Suburban while accompanied by two Secret Service agents on Sunday. Trump could be seen wearing a cloth mask, while the two agents seated inside the car with him wore full protective gear, including medical gowns, respirator masks and eye protection.

Trump's move to wave at his supporters who gathered across the street from the hospital drew outrage from members of the Secret Service and medical professionals who warned that a patient with a contagious disease shouldn't be leaving his hospital room or putting his protective detail at risk.

The president addressed the controversy in a tweet on Monday.

It is reported that the Media is upset because I got into a secure vehicle to say thank you to the many fans and supporters who were standing outside of the hospital for many hours, and even days, to pay their respect to their President. If I didn’t do it, Media would say RUDE!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2020

Thompson said that he's seeking more information about protective protocols for Secret Service agents.

""The height of reckless disregard for others was the president’s ‘joyride’ yesterday where Secret Service agents were required to drive him around in a hermetically sealed vehicle. Exposing Secret Service personnel to the virus does not just put them at risk, it puts their families and the public at risk,"" Thompson said in a statement.

""So we can know more about how these events have affected the Secret Service and national security, I have requested a briefing from the agency on the current safeguards in place for their employees — including on the president’s protective detail — and how Secret Service agents can be kept safe from coronavirus-related threats, including apparently the president himself,"" Thompson continued.

The Secret Service would not say if the agents in the vehicle with Trump on Sunday are now quarantining.

""The Secret Service will continue to follow established protocols to ensure the safety of our employees. The Secret Service does not discuss our protectees or the specific means and methods regarding our protective mission,"" a Secret Service spokesperson said in an email to The Hill on Monday.

""For privacy and operational security reasons, the Secret Service is not releasing how many of its employees have tested positive for COVID-19, nor how many of its employees were, or currently are, quarantined,"" the spokesperson added.

White House spokesman Judd Deere said on Sunday that measures were taken to protect everyone in the car with Trump.

“Appropriate precautions were taken in the execution of this movement to protect the President and all those supporting it, including [personal protective equipment]. The movement was cleared by the medical team as safe to do,"" Deere said.

Multiple Secret Service members expressed outrage to CNN about the episode while noting that some agents have already tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling with Trump to rallies, where attendees frequently have not worn masks or followed social distancing guidelines.

""That should never have happened,"" one Secret Service agent who currently works on the presidential and first family detail told CNN.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that most people with COVID-19 should self-isolate for 10 days if symptoms and fever subside by then. Trump announced his diagnosis early Friday.

James Phillips, an attending physician at Walter Reed, tweeted that Trump's drive-by appearance was ""insanity.""

""Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary Presidential 'drive-by' just now has to be quarantined for 14 days,"" Phillips tweeted. ""They might get sick. They may die. For political theater. This is insanity.""

Trump said in a video posted to Twitter on Sunday that he has ""learned a lot"" about the virus while undergoing treatment.

""I learned about it by really going to school,"" Trump said. ""This isn’t the 'let’s read the book' school. And I get it, and I understand it, and it’s a very interesting thing.""",2020-10-05 14:24:27-04:00,
Bill to expand support for community addiction treatment passes House,"A bill that would establish a $25 million fund to support organizations specializing in addiction treatment and support for family members of those suffering from addiction is heading to the Senate after passing the House last week.

Under the bill, local and national groups under a wide umbrella of addiction-related services would be allowed to apply for grants under a fund established to provide $25 million in grants over half a decade. Applicable groups include addiction support groups for both those with addictions and their families, education and training organizations, as well as ""systems navigation"" services which help families find addiction treatment centers.

“Addressing the addiction crisis in our state requires supporting families who are impacted by the crisis every day. Families are often quickly thrown into a world of addiction and substance use disorder that they know little about, without the resources they need to support their loved ones,” Gillibrand said in a news release in February.

“This key step will support people living with substance use disorder and will encourage their recovery,"" she added.

Rates of addiction and substance misuse have risen across the U.S. amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has forced millions out of work and deepened economic woes for many Americans. A survey earlier this year by the Addiction Policy Forum found that 20 percent of Americans reported themselves or a family member increasing their use of recreational drugs or alcohol since the pandemic began.

A separate study last year before COVID-19 reached the U.S. found that nearly half of U.S. adults knew a family member with substance abuse issues.

The lawmakers' bill is supported by a number of national and local groups focused on battling stigmas around addiction treatment, including the Partnership to End Addiction, which operates Drugfree.org.

One supporter of the bill pointed to the expansion of family support services as a key step in battling the stigma of addiction in an emailed statement to The Hill.

“Empowering families with inspiration and resources is key to changing the narrative and reducing the stigma of [substance abuse disorder]. As a father of a daughter who nearly lost her life to a drug overdose, I know the power of compassionate and fearless conversations,” said Robert Kanter, head of East Coast Addiction Marketing.

Joaquin Castro questions whether postal workers broke federal law by hiding mail,"Rep.

“There’s a federal law against any postal service employee doing anything to tamper with the mail or delaying the mail,” Castro told the San Antonio Express-News editorial board Friday. “So right away, that’s a big issue right there. Whether their actions to delay mail or even the incident here in San Antonio with me — if you go move that mail and just keep it somewhere on purpose to hide it from someone, are you delaying mail in violation of federal law?”

Postal union leader Carlos Barrios said that workers were allegedly told to move the mail before Castro arrived to make the situation seem less dire.

A spokeswoman for Rep. Marc Veasey (D-Texas) told the Express-News that a similar thing happened to Veasey when he visited a mail processing plant in Fort Worth.

“Congressman Veasey heard similar accounts from local postal workers during discussions this past week and had a similar experience to that of Rep. Castro’s when visiting a mail processing plant up in Fort Worth today,” the spokeswoman said in a statement.

Barrios told the paper that workers moved about 150,000 pieces of mail and sent them in a trailer to Austin prior to Castro's visit.

“It was an attempt to get it out of the building to give a perception that everything was hunky dory,” Barrios told the paper. “I work there. And I see the mail all the time. They started cleaning things because someone was coming.”",2020-08-21 18:03:19-04:00,
Five things to watch at the Democratic National Convention,"A Democratic National Convention like no other will kick off on Monday, reaching a climax with a speech by newly minted presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE on Thursday evening.

The convention, originally scheduled for Milwaukee, was first postponed from July to August over concerns about the coronavirus, and then moved almost entirely online.

Here are five major things to watch.

How diminished will the event be by the pandemic?

Conventions have historically given presidential candidates significant — if often fleeting — boosts. Data website FiveThirtyEight noted last month that, since 1968, candidates have experienced an average post-convention bounce of 5 percentage points in national opinion polls.

Conventions are powerful in part because they draw in TV viewers who are not following every twist and turn in an election campaign.

On a good night, the top shows on cable news pull in about 4 million viewers. When then-Sen. Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaA wave election? Or a fundamental realigning of American politics? If it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Pittsburgh newspaper backs Trump in first GOP presidential endorsement since 1972 MORE (D-Ill.) accepted the Democratic nomination in a Denver football stadium in 2008, 38 million people were watching.

Democratic convention organizers have been working for months on ways to enliven a virtual convention. But it will be enormously difficult to conjure up the same kind of pizzazz seen at an in-person gathering.

Media coverage will also be very different. One key metric will be the extent to which TV viewing figures take a hit.

The Biden campaign can take solace from the fact that the equivalent Republican event, taking place a week later, is grappling with similar problems. But President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE at least has the unique platform of the presidency. For a challenger, a convention is a rare chance to claim the national spotlight.

That spotlight is going to be significantly dimmer this year.

Can Biden inspire — or at least seem fresh — in his big speech?

“The good news is that people know me,” Biden often said on the stump during the pre-coronavirus stretch of the primary campaign. “The bad news is that people know me.”

It’s as concise as a summation as you could get.

Biden has been a national political figure for longer than many voters have been alive. He was first elected to the Senate in 1972 and stayed there for 36 years before becoming vice president to Obama.

Biden partisans make a virtue of his familiarity. They say a return to more normal, orthodox leadership could be just what many voters are looking for after the endless controversy and conflict of Trump’s first term.

It’s a plausible argument — and Biden has the polling lead to show for it.

But it’s not the full story.

Those same polls have often shown that more Trump supporters than Biden supporters are passionate about their preferred candidate.

A recent CBS News analysis found Trump supporters more enthusiastic than Biden backers — albeit sometimes by modest margins — across the five key states it examined: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Texas.

Biden faces a real challenge on Thursday — how to give some new vim and vigor to his appeal, having spent a half-century in public life.

What will Trump do to take some of the attention away?

Even Trump’s foes acknowledge that he has been effective at setting the media agenda — much to their frustration.

The president has an apparently insatiable desire to be center-stage — and whether that’s for positive or negative stories sometimes seems beside the point for him.

He will not want to cede ground in the publicity war for four days straight. The New York Times reported on Saturday that the Trump campaign is spending ""high seven figures"" on an intensive digital ad campaign during the Democratic convention — including a banner ad on the YouTube homepage for 96 hours, beginning Tuesday.

Trump is slated to give public remarks on Monday and Tuesday in three competitive states: Minnesota, Wisconsin and Arizona. There seems a reasonable possibility that he could also offer rolling Twitter commentary on some of the Democratic speeches, especially from Obama and his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE.

Trump’s attacks can cause heartburn even among GOP ranks, as has been the case with his immediate barrage against Biden’s chosen running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden begins two-day campaign sprint in battleground Pennsylvania Trump praises Texas supporters who surrounded Biden-Harris bus FBI investigating Biden bus surrounded by pro-Trump cars: report MORE (D-Calif.). His comments in that regard have sparked accusations of sexism.

But the president will likely judge it a success if he can inject himself — by whatever means — into the middle of coverage of the Democrats’ big occasion.

How hard will the Obamas and the Clintons hit Trump?

The biggest names in Democratic politics will all be speaking at the convention, but aside from Biden and Harris, a lot of the attention is likely to focus on two families.

Or a fundamental realigning of American politics? Davis: 5 questions for Trump voters MORE on Tuesday, with Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton slated for Wednesday.

The third day could prove the most dramatic. Obama frustrated some of his supporters by not speaking out more publicly during the early part of his successor’s tenure. That has begun to change recently.

On Friday, during an appearance on the podcast of his former aide David Plouffe, the former president accused Trump of trying to “actively kneecap the Postal Service” in order to discourage voting by mail.

Hillary Clinton has been more willing to criticize Trump throughout his presidency, especially on Twitter. Strong attacks from her would be virtually guaranteed to draw a counter-blast from Trump — though the former secretary of State might not mind that at all.

Bill Clinton is no longer the dominant figure he once was, but he can still connect with the kind of heartland voters Biden needs — and who migrated to Trump last time around.

Michelle Obama has been the most admired woman in the nation for the past two years, according to Gallup polling.

Her speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention was widely hailed as among the best of the entire event. She recently confessed on her podcast to suffering “low-grade depression” about the state of the nation. Monday will be her biggest chance to make a difference.

How public are the tensions between the left and the Biden camp?

The tensions also produced one of the more surprising — and viral — moments of the convention when comic Sarah Silverman, who had supported Sanders, said from the stage that “the Bernie or bust people” were being “ridiculous.”

Democratic dissent that year came against a widespread sense that Clinton was odds-on to be elected president. Now, the sheer fervor with which Democrats want to get Trump out of the White House could help bind the party together.

That doesn’t mean it will be all plain sailing.

At an in-person campaign event at the historically Black Florida Memorial University, Harris accused Trump of a “reckless disregard of the lives and health and well-being"" of Americans, according to Axios.

“I find it so outrageous,” the California senator added.

Harris also referenced a February interview in which Trump told Woodward the coronavirus was “deadly stuff” and far more dangerous than the flu.

At the time, the president publicly compared COVID-19 and its severity to the flu.

“So, basically what we are hearing is that on Jan. 28, the president and the vice president were informed about the imminence and the dangers of COVID-19,” Harris said.

""He knew it was airborne that people would breathe it” Harris added.

Total U.S. coronavirus deaths reported each morning this week: Monday, 214,771; Tuesday, 215,086; Wednesday, 215,910.







Judge Amy Coney Barrett gave little ground on Tuesday as senators tried to gauge how she might decide cases before the Supreme Court. Measured in her answers and unflappable in her demeanor, Barrett said she would be bound by the text of statutes and would approach the Constitution as law rather than seek outcomes she would prefer if she were “queen of the world.”

The Hill: Barrett sidesteps Democratic questions amid high-stakes grilling.

The Hill: Five takeaways from Barrett’s 11 hours of testimony. She is back on Capitol Hill today for a final round of questions (The Associated Press).

She said Roe v. Wade is not a “super-precedent” but added, “That does not mean it should be overruled.” She said she would not be used as “a pawn” to decide the presidential election, but she declined to say if she would recuse herself from 2020 election challenges if she is confirmed. Probed about her criticisms written as a law professor about the Supreme Court’s rulings upholding the landmark health reform law of the Obama presidency, Barrett told the Senate Judiciary Committee, “I’m not on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act” (The Washington Post).

“No one has elicited from me any commitment in a case,” she told senators, declining to discuss anything President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE tweeted about his ambition to see a conservative court overturn ObamaCare and firmly insisting that she would limit her testimony to cases she had either ruled on or previously publicly discussed.

Senate Republicans are downplaying the chances that the Supreme Court will overturn the landmark 2010 health law, despite their support for a challenge to be heard by justices a week after the elections. ""No one believes the Supreme Court is going to strike down the Affordable Care Act,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.) said Monday night. Democrats describe the law as under grave threat (The Hill).

“I certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think that I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide the election for the American people,” Barrett told the committee. Trump has urged the Senate to quickly confirm his nominee, saying a ninth justice may be necessary if a case involving his reelection goes to the high court (The Washington Post).

Barrett's nomination has elevated the debate over abortion rights to a level not seen in years. She was evasive on the issue during Tuesday’s questioning when she declined to say whether Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, The Hill’s Alexander Bolton reports. There are 17 abortion-related cases moving through the courts, increasing the odds that one could come before the Supreme Court if Barrett, 48, is confirmed this month to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Ruth Bader GinsburgThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law Ginsburg's granddaughter cuts election ad for progressive group: 'Make her voice heard at the ballot box' The truth, the whole truth about protecting preexisting conditions MORE, as seems all but certain.

The New York Times: Amid the Barrett hearing choreography, a near-certain outcome: confirmation. Democrats pressed Barrett more with the election in mind than out of any hope of derailing her rise to the Supreme Court.

Reuters: Barrett avoids questions about abortion, gay marriage.

The Washington Post: Four early takeaways from day two of the Barrett hearings.

LEADING THE DAY





2020 POLITICS: Former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s campaign knows it is in the driver’s seat as national polls have him above 50 percent and as key battleground state polls continue to show him in the ascendency over Trump 20 days out from Election Day.

As The Hill’s Amie Parnes writes, Team Biden believes it is doing just enough as the hourglass winds down toward Nov. 3, with the former vice president ramping up events despite rising coronavirus cases across the country, especially compared to his pre-convention schedule. However, he remains at arm’s length in some senses as his team continues to avoid wide-ranging sit-down interviews where Biden could get into trouble.

However, as Amie notes, Biden’s lead has given him the upper hand in certain situations, with last week’s battle over the second presidential debate serving as a prime example. It was the former VP’s team that had the take-it-or-leave it stance.

“While Team Biden is indeed milking the clock, importantly they are not sitting on the ball but looking to score when there is an open shot,” said Chris Lehane, a presidential campaign veteran. “And given the other team does not really seem to have an especially fulsome defense, there are a lot of open layups.""

Biden made his latest campaign stop in Florida, where he made a pair of appearances in an effort to woo senior citizens to his side. The former vice president zeroed in on Medicare, Social Security and the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has an outsize effect on older voters.

“You deserve respect and peace of mind, but you’re not getting it because to Donald Trump, you’re expendable. You’re forgettable. You’re virtually nobody. That’s how he sees seniors. That’s how he sees you,” Biden said.

The Hill: Biden woos senior voters amid signs they're turning on Trump.

Joshua Green, Bloomberg Businessweek: Florida could seal Trump’s fate on Election Night.

Meanwhile, Trump made his second campaign stop in as many days in Johnstown, Pa., distracted by worries that he could lose to an opponent he suggested is elderly and feeble.

“How the hell do you lose to a guy like this, is this possible? Oh, I’ll never come to Pennsylvania again.” ...“Suburban women: Will you please like me?” he asked. “Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?” (The Hill).

MORE CONGRESS: Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided? Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.) maintained that she will not settle for the Trump administration’s latest coronavirus relief offer as the president urged lawmakers to “go big” once again in an effort to strike an elusive agreement before Election Day.

As The Hill’s Mike Lillis reports, Pelosi batted down calls from some members of the House Democratic Caucus who are clamoring for her to take the White House’s recent $1.8 trillion offer, citing the “leverage” she holds at the moment as Republicans inch closer to her $2.2 trillion price tag.

“I appreciate the, shall we say, a couple people saying, ‘Take it, take it, take it,’” Pelosi said in a phone conference with Democrats, a source on the call told The Hill. “Take it? Take it? Even the president is saying, ‘Go big or go home.’”

The vast majority of those calling for Pelosi to make a deal are on the moderate wing of the party. However, some rumblings have emerged from progressives.

“Dems can’t wait for the perfect deal,” Rep. Ro Khanna Rohit (Ro) KhannaReestablishing American prosperity by investing in the 'Badger Belt' House Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education Biden says he opposes Supreme Court term limits MORE (D-Calif.), a prominent member of the House Progressive Caucus, tweeted on Tuesday. “We have a moral obligation to get folks relief, now.”

Later on Tuesday, Pelosi fired back at Khanna, calling him an “apologist for the Republican position.”

""I don’t know why you’re always an apologist and many of your colleagues are apologists for the Republican position — Ro Khanna, that’s nice,” Pelosi told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “That isn’t what we’re going to do” (The Washington Post).

The chatter among House Democrats came as Trump made his latest plea for a deal ahead of Nov. 3, tweeting, “STIMULUS! Go big or go home!!!” (The Hill).

That call has not gone over well with Senate Republicans, who continue to move in the opposite direction and show minimal appetite for such an agreement. On Tuesday, McConnell announced plans for the Senate to take up a $500 billion relief bill next week that will include additional aid for small businesses hit hard by the fallout from the pandemic.

“When the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the [Paycheck Protection Program],"" McConnell said in a statement. The Senate is out for the remainder of the week.

The GOP leader explained during a stop in Kentucky on Tuesday that the measure he has in mind would direct funding toward schools, hospitals and protections from coronavirus-related lawsuits.

“I made some news today. We're going to go back to the floor next week again with a proposal more narrowly targeted with a significant amount of money. I can remember when a half a trillion dollars ... was real money,” McConnell said (The Hill).

In September, Senate Democrats blocked a “skinny” $650 billion proposal that garnered 52 votes from Senate Republicans (The Washington Post).

The Washington Post: White House willing to cut a stimulus deal without “liability shield,” breaking with McConnell.

And finally … Jesse Katayama, a 26-year-old Japanese tourist who favors garb emblazoned with the names of American sports teams, ventured to Peru seven months ago envisioning his final stop on an adventure around the world. On his bucket list was a planned visit to a 15th-century Inca citadel located 8,000 feet above sea level at Machu Picchu. Then the coronavirus pandemic shuttered tourist sites and locked down the country, stranding Katayama until this week (The New York Times).

For his patience, the government of Peru granted him a special tour by himself, accompanied only by park representatives.

“After the lockdown, the first man to visit Machu Picchu is meeeeeee,” Katayama wrote in an Instagram post with an image in which he and his guide are seen wearing masks.

Alejandro Neyra, Peru’s culture minister, said during a virtual news conference on Monday that Katayama traveled to Peru “with the dream of being able to enter” and would get his wish “with our head of the park so that he can do this before returning to his country.”

"Democrats scramble on COVID-19 relief amid division, Trump surprise","House Democratic leaders scrambled Wednesday for a cohesive legislative and political strategy on emergency coronavirus aid.

The Democrats are seeking a bill that can provide broad-based relief to struggling Americans, energize the party’s progressive base ahead of November and appease the various factions of the caucus now feuding over the right path forward.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided?

Hoyer emerged from the earlier meeting promoting Pelosi’s preferred strategy: negotiate with the White House and bring a bill to the floor only when a bipartisan deal has been reached.

Yet that design is sure to rattle the Democrats who want assurances of a fresh vote on some version of coronavirus aid this month even absent an agreement with Republicans — a promise leadership has declined to make.

Centrist Democrats are leading that charge, but even some liberals are piling on, calling for a vote on legislation in the range of $2.2 trillion — Pelosi’s latest offer to the White House — to send the message to voters that Democrats aren’t sitting idle while the pandemic ravages the economy and continues to kill more than 1,000 Americans a day.

Senate Republicans had initially offered a $1.1 trillion package in emergency aid, but subsequently voted on a proposal providing just $650 billion — including just $350 billion in new funding. Trump, joining the Democrats, said it wasn’t enough.

“Go for the much higher numbers, Republicans, it all comes back to the USA anyway (one way or another!),” Trump tweeted.

It was unclear what higher number the president is ready to accept, but his shifting position quickly energized Democrats, who have hammered the Republicans for pushing “emaciated” proposals they deem insufficient to address the health and economic crises caused by the pandemic.

GOP leaders, meanwhile, were pushing back, warning that a funding package in the $1.5 trillion range would likely lose support from a significant number of Republicans.

“If the number gets too high, anything that got passed in the Senate will be passed mostly with Democrat votes and a handful of Republicans,” Thune told reporters in the Capitol. “So it's going to have to stay in a, sort of, realistic range if ... we want to maximize, optimize the number of Republican senators that will vote for it.”

Pelosi, meanwhile, is sticking with her last offer: $2.2 trillion, noting that that figure represents a $1.2 trillion reduction in the HEROES Act, which the House passed in May. She added that she has no intention of staging a vote on legislation if it lacks the bipartisan support to win Trump's signature.

“We could put a bill on the floor, but we want to put a bill on the floor that will become law,” Pelosi said in an appearance on MSNBC's “Morning Joe” program.

Front-line Democrats, those facing the toughest reelections this fall, have been begging leadership to get back to the negotiating table and strike a deal with the White House or pass a smaller package that would be more palatable to Senate Republicans.

The leader of the moderate Blue Dog Democrats, Rep. Stephanie Murphy Stephanie MurphyWhy it's time for a majority female Cabinet Democrats scramble on COVID-19 relief amid division, Trump surprise Bank lobbying group launches ad backing Collins reelection bid MORE (D-Fla.), voiced frustration with leadership’s inaction and pointed to the “anxiousness” of vulnerable members.

“I am hopeful that as leadership registers the anxiousness of the members, both Democrats and Republicans to get something done, that they will be responsive to that,” she said.

“We can argue about what the specifics of a plan should look like,” she added. “But the important thing is that we get back to the negotiating table and hammer out a deal that can be passed into law.”",2020-09-16 17:58:50-04:00,
House Democrats eyeing much broader Phase 3 stimulus,"House Democrats are indicating they want to go bigger and broader than the already massive economic stimulus package offered by Senate Republicans to blunt the coronavirus pandemic.

On a Thursday conference call featuring more than 200 members of the House Democratic caucus, lawmakers one by one laid out a sweeping wish list of provisions they want to see included in the nascent package, including a boost in infrastructure spending, an expansion of Social Security benefits and funding for states to set up an all-mail voting system in the event the pandemic extends into November’s elections.

“This is a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,” Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) told lawmakers, according to a source on the call.

And while not all of the Democratic proposals are likely to emerge in the final House package — legislation that is being crafted by party leaders and various committee heads — they foreshadow a showdown with McConnell and the White House over the size and direction of the latest relief bill, the third to be considered this month as policymakers scramble to prevent the spread of the virus.

McConnell has warned that he wants to limit the proposal to addressing the most immediate economic damage created by the pandemic.

""Anything that doesn't address that pandemic, it seems to me, should not be considered,"" he said.

Yet that could set the chambers on a collision course over what provisions fit that benchmark, as House Democrats press for a wide range of relief provisions that include a broader expansion of unemployment benefits, a boost in Social Security payments and new funding for job training.

“We want to make sure that we get adequate relief to people who need it most, and that there be some economic sideboards on the things we do, so that we're not just sending checks to wealthy people who don't need money, so that we're not just rewarding corporations,” Rep.

“Some of these elements are going to be common to both parties and both houses,” he added. “My guess is that they're going to be some pretty strong differences, though, when it comes to certain industries and how we provide economic relief.”

Yet any new stimulus package will need the backing of the majority House Democrats to reach the president’s desk. And Pelosi has asked House committee chairs to begin compiling proposals as Democrats craft their own measure.

It’s leverage that hasn’t been overlooked by the Democrats as the negotiations enter a crucial stage and both sides are stressing the urgency of reaching an agreement.

“You're obviously not going to get a package done without Speaker Pelosi having a huge role in it. There's just not a way for that to work, nor should there be,” said Huffman. “The House has been the lead on this from day one, and I don't see any reason why we would suddenly step back and let Mitch McConnell drive the ship.”",2020-03-19 18:33:22-04:00,

Women of color flex political might,"A century after women were granted the right to vote, women of color are growing their political power in races across the country.

Four women of color serve in the Senate, and 44 are members of the House.

Dickerson, now the national political director for Forward Majority, a Democratic group focused on flipping state legislatures, said women of color are often the only ones in the room representing a diverse perspective.

“Black and Brown women have had to be that way our entire lives, so we have more experience than white men at navigating intersectionality,” she said.

Women are also working to make inroads in state and local offices as well. According to CAWP, there are 90 women serving in statewide elective executive offices, but only 17 percent of them are women of color. And of the 2,158 women in state legislatures across the country, just a quarter are women of color.

“We know that is where the biggest impact on people’s lives happen,” said A'shanti Gholar, the president of Emerge America, a Democratic group dedicated to helping women run for office up and down the ballot. “You see more Black women running at these levels because the fact is, Black women, they have been the community activists, they have been leading, they’re now putting their names on the ballot to make change in their communities.”

In Texas, Akilah Bacy, a Black woman, local attorney and community volunteer, was met with doubt and skepticism after she announced her candidacy because of her status as a first-time candidate in the state’s 138th House District.

“I was the only first-time candidate,” Bacy told The Hill. “They were like, prepare to run again, and I said OK, we’ll see, but I’m going to run this time first.”

Bacy ended up clearing the primary with 47 percent of the vote and the subsequent run-off with almost 80 percent of the vote.

The increased number of women of color running for office comes as the U.S. grapples with the issue of racial justice and equality amid the deaths of Black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police.

The issue has inspired a number of Black women to run for office, including Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, who was killed by neighborhood watch member George Zimmerman in 2012.

“When we want to say that we need people who truly understand, that unfortunately means that we need people who have been through these dire situations,” Gholar said.

Data shows that the majority of women and women of color running for office tend to be Democrats. This year, there are almost twice as many women of color running as Democrats, 162, than as Republicans, 86.

“I think that the left has outpaced the right in terms of tapping into all corners of the country, all corners of their party, and looking outside the box to find good candidates,” said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for Winning for Women, a group dedicated to electing Republican women to office. “We’ve gotten better and smarter about doing that, and it’s showing.”

A number of Republican women of color running for Congress have already made headlines.

“I’m Cuban American, so to see someone like Maria Salazar run for office and people like her, it’s just encouraging,” said Perez-Cubas.

Republicans and Democrats both say that their candidates face more obstacles than white or male candidates, especially when it comes to money.

“Our campaigns are still not funded in the way that white men’s campaigns are funded,” Dickerson said. “We can’t self-fund our campaigns, and we don’t necessarily have the network.”

While women of color running for public office acknowledge the progress that has been made since mostly white women were granted the right to vote a century ago, and most Black women in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act, they say they are acutely aware that more progress needs to be made.

“Frederick Douglass said what is the Fourth of July to the negro,” Bacy said. “Well, a lot of it to me is, what is the 19th Amendment to the Black woman?”

Five things we learned from this year's primaries,"Through a pandemic, protests and partisanship, voters in all but four states have picked party nominees for November’s general election, setting up the clashes that will determine the shape of American politics over the next two years.

Their choices have sent clear signals about where each party’s electorate stands, and what the two warring factions have in common: Both Democratic and Republican voters want change — though there is little agreement on what, exactly, ought to be changed.

As the first general election ballots go out, here are the lessons we learned from the 2020 primary season:

It’s the year of the woman

A century after the ratification of the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote, women are running for office in record numbers.

The two major parties have nominated 296 women to run for U.S. House seats, blowing away the previous record set in 2018, at 234. Forty-seven districts feature two women running against each other, according to a tally maintained by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers.

More women — 60 — ran for seats in the Senate than ever before. Voters in four states — Iowa, Maine, Wyoming and West Virginia — will decide between two female Senate candidates in November.

It helps that both parties are making special efforts to recruit women — albeit for different reasons. Democrats relied on women to win back the House majority in 2018, when 24 of the 43 candidates who flipped Republican-held seats were women. Republicans, who fear a gender gap they cannot overcome, have made a point of recruiting women candidates, though not all have survived their primaries.

All politics is (still) local

It is very hard to beat a sitting incumbent in a party primary. It is easier when that incumbent has lost touch with his or her district.

Eight members of Congress lost bids for renomination this year. In most cases, those who will find themselves out of a job come January were ousted by voters who thought they had gone Washington.

The GOP is shifting right

Some election cycles mark ideological shifts in one party or another. The 1994 wave ushered in a new generation of hard-nosed Republicans in the image of Newt Gingrich Newton (Newt) Leroy GingrichMORE (R-Ga.). The 2010 wave brought the Tea Party to Congress.

This year, a host of Republicans poised to win office in November will make the Tea Party look like genteel moderates.

Boebert is just one of a new brand of arch-conservatives who are likely headed to Congress next year, some of whom have embraced the fringe and fantastical QAnon conspiracy.

In other districts, candidates backed by national Republicans lost primary elections to more conservative challengers. Promising Republican recruits like Pierce Bush in Texas, former Lt. Gov. Evelyn Sanguinetti in Illinois and Earl Granville in Pennsylvania all lost Republican nominations in potential swing districts to more conservative rivals.

Trump is everything

President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE loves touting his support among the Republican base, and he is right. The GOP is held together less by an ideology than to a fealty to their party leader; more Republican-registered voters say they are a supporter of Trump (49 percent) than of the party itself (37 percent), according to a recent poll conducted for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.

Among candidates running for Congress, that number may be even more skewed.

Trump has appeared in a quarter of all advertisements run by Republican candidates this year, according to data maintained by political scientists who run the Wesleyan Media Project. That is more often than any issue mentioned in GOP ads except taxes.

Trump’s popularity among his party’s core supporters has given him the room to diverge from the ideology that has driven the GOP for decades. He has broken with past Republican presidents on free trade, America’s role in the world, spending and deficits.

Trump’s time in power is limited to either the next few months or the next four and a half years. But even out of office, he is almost certainly not going to give up the Twitter feed that has become his bully pulpit. The party of Trump now is likely to be the party of Trump for years to come.

Absentees are king

The share of Americans who voted by mail has roughly doubled this century, from 10 percent in 2000 to almost 21 percent in the 2016 election, according to Pew Research Center.

Some states, like Washington, Utah and Colorado, have already shifted their elections entirely to the mail. A huge majority of voters in states like Arizona, Florida and Nevada also use mail-in voting.

The coronavirus pandemic is hastening those trends across every other state — even in some where absentee voting has never been a major part of the political culture. State after state has set new records for the number of voters casting ballots in the mail, in some cases beating their old records five, 10 or 15 times over.

Most states are well equipped to handle the surge in volume, and many begin counting ballots even before the polls close. But others are not — New York took more than a month to count the absentee ballots cast in its June primary, and Alaska took a week to begin opening their absentee ballots.

The two parties like absentee ballots: Knowing who has returned their ballot gives the parties the ability to focus their scarce resources to the population that has yet to vote.

But as Trump raises the unsubstantiated specter of fraud in the mail — and even urges his own supporters to vote twice, a felony — the heavy reliance on mail ballots has become a factor fraught with dread. In a close race, absentee ballots counted long after Election Day will prove fodder for those on the losing side, and the Russian bot farms determined to undermine confidence in American democracy.",2020-09-04 06:00:07-04:00,

""That’s exactly what’s playing out here in this district,” Morse told The Hill. “While people are suffering, we have a congressman who’s using his power for corporations and special interests.”

Despite the 39-year-old Kennedy’s track record as a member of the House Progressive Caucus, the 74-year-old Markey has been able to harness left-wing support thanks in part to his stance on environmental issues. Markey’s campaign slogan reads, “It’s not your age — it’s the age of your ideas that’s important.”

The senator, who is the longest serving member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, has received endorsements from groups like the Sunrise Movement, Our Revolution and the Working Families Party.

“When we’re talking about being a movement candidate, we’re not just talking about someone necessarily [who] was a volunteer and came up through their organization,” said Steen of Our Revolution Massachusetts. “We’re talking about someone who is willing to be the inside voice for these outside groups and enable them to access some of the more arcane and inaccessible elements working within Congress.”

Kennedy argued in an interview with The Hill that endorsements from outside groups are not ultimately going to decide the contest that has been playing out across the commonwealth for nearly a year.

The congressman also pointed out that a number of the progressive groups endorsing Markey in the primary have endorsed him in prior races.

“I don’t think there’s a credible argument that can be made there, whether it’s on strength on the environment or human rights or LGBT rights, or anything else, my record there is a very strong one, and I’m proud of it,” Kennedy said.

The RealClearPolitics polling average shows Markey up by 11.2 points.

Meanwhile, strategists say that attention from both the media and high-profile progressives in the Senate primary could also help turn out the vote for Morse in his race against Neal.

Morse has sought to position himself as a progressive alternative to Neal, telling the left-leaning Jacobin magazine over the weekend that if elected, he would be one of the only Democrats to stand up to the party’s establishment wing.

“I would be one of the few Democrats that stands up to the Democratic Party, not just the Republican Party, in fundamentally changing our federal budget to reinvest in people and in domestic priorities like transportation, health care, education, and other social programs,” Morse told the publication.

Morse in an interview with The Hill argued that Neal is largely absent from the district, saying, “You would never know that Congressman Neal has power when you look at the district.""

Neal’s campaign hit back against the claim, calling it “pure fiction” and citing 700 Neal-hosted events in the district in recent years.

All of the candidates competing on Tuesday will also have to contend with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on voter turnout. Tuesday will mark the first statewide vote in Massachusetts to include a vote-by-mail option.

Progressive groups on the ground in Massachusetts say they are working with voters to ensure they understand how the mail-in system works, as well as helping them overcome issues in the system.

“A lot of people are having to make decisions about can they safely vote in person [while] maintaining socially distant guidelines, and what’s their risk there,” said Steen.

The vote-by-mail option could lead to record turnout, with Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin (D) predicting that there could be more than 1.2 million and as much as 1.3 million Democratic ballots cast on Tuesday.

More than 100 Democrats press Trump to extend jobless benefits,"House Democrats this week are pressing President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE to extend emergency jobless benefits in response to the economic turmoil caused by the fast-spreading coronavirus.

The issue is poised to be one of the highest barriers to a bipartisan deal as Congress prepares to launch negotiations on a fifth round of emergency pandemic relief, which leaders from both parties want to finalize by month's end.

Congress in March had adopted a broad expansion of federal unemployment insurance benefits, including a weekly bump of $600 above traditional state payments, designed to cushion the impact on workers and retail spending amid historic mass layoffs caused by the deadly pandemic.

ADVERTISEMENT

With those unemployment checks set to expire at the end of the month, Democrats are pushing for Trump to extend them — with the additional $600 intact.

In a letter to the president set to be delivered on Thursday, more than 100 House Democrats said the extension is ""essential"" to an economic recovery.

""Cutting off enhanced unemployment benefits while the economy is still in crisis would ignore the millions of Americans who are still suffering,"" the lawmakers wrote.

Davis (D-Ill.), the letter is endorsed by 110 Democrats. In it, they note that the recession has not only spiked unemployment from 3.6 percent in January to more than 11 percent today, but it's also hit minority communities particularly hard — an issue of particular prominence amid the protests against racial injustice that have followed the police killing of George Floyd in May.

""Our nation is currently reckoning with deep-rooted racial injustices,"" reads the letter. ""These injustices are the reason communities of color disproportionately feel the health and economic effects of this pandemic and must be addressed.""

In a phone interview Thursday morning, Kildee warned that if Congress allows the benefits to expire without throwing an additional lifeline, workers would lose homes, be evicted from apartments and curtail their spending on essential goods that would lead to the closure of countless small businesses. The result, he said, would be another Great Depression.

""It's literally the difference between people surviving or not surviving,"" Kildee said. ""It would just be devastating.""

In May, House Democrats passed a fifth coronavirus relief bill, the HEROES Act, providing an additional $3 trillion in emergency funding. It includes an extension of unemployment insurance benefits, including the $600 supplemental payment, through January of 2021.

But Trump and top administration officials have said they'll oppose an extension of the $600 supplemental, arguing that because the benefit provides some workers with more money than the salary they lost, it creates a disincentive for those workers to seek jobs.

Joining Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.) has opposed the additional payment, characterizing it as ""a bonus not to go back to work.""

As an alternative approach, some Republicans are pushing for a ""back-to-work"" bonus, which would provide laid-off workers receiving unemployment benefits a one-time payment if they return to the workforce.

Kildee said he's open to that idea, but rejected the notion that workers receiving unemployment insurance benefits wouldn't jump at the chance to return to jobs — if jobs were available amid the spike in coronavirus cases around the country.

""That's pretty insulting to the American worker,"" he said. ""People will choose work if they have the chance to go back to work.""

Anecdotally, Kildee said he's spoken with Republicans who agree in an extension of the additional unemployment insurance benefits. But those lawmakers won't break with Trump, he said, for fear of a backlash from the president.

""Privately, there's an acknowledgement that we have to extend it,"" Kildee said. ""But until the president gives them permission to say so, most of them are unwilling to cross him.""",2020-07-09 11:24:51-04:00,
Legal marijuana backers tout potential money for states,"PHOENIX — Supporters of ballot measures that would legalize marijuana are pitching cannabis as a new revenue source that can fund schools, roads and even public safety, a new appeal aimed at winning over suburban voters who might still be hesitant about the accessibility of legal pot.

Voters in five states will decide seven marijuana-related ballot measures this year. Initiatives or propositions in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota would legalize marijuana for recreational use. Measures in Mississippi and South Dakota would legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes.

Proponents of those measures say new legal sales — and the excise taxes that come with them — would fill revenue gaps at a time when state government budgets have been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic.

“It’s time to legalize adult use marijuana and generate millions for Arizona,” an advertisement supporting Proposition 207 here says. “$300 million in new revenue for public safety, for our community colleges, for mental health services and for roads in our rural communities.”

The new pitch to voters is a marked evolution from earlier years, when legalization proponents focused on the harm wrought on minority communities by the decades-long war on drugs.

In the past, the pro-legalization message “was a lot about how an arrest can ruin a life, and you can’t get credit, and you can’t get an apartment, and a young person can make a mistake and be messed up for life,” said Martin Hamburger, a Democratic strategist working on legalization campaigns this year in Montana, South Dakota and Mississippi.

“The messages that we’re using [now] in a lot of these places are about how people can access marijuana for health purposes and the revenue that’s available,” he said.

To some supporters, an end to the harshest consequences of the war on drugs remains a powerful argument in favor of legalization.

“From a criminal justice perspective, the revenue that we should be worried about is the fact that we’re not going to be destroying a lot of young men’s lives for carrying a small amount of marijuana,” said Rep.

Recreational use of marijuana is legal in 11 states and the District of Columbia. Vermont became the latest state to legalize recreational use, after Gov. Phil Scott (R) allowed a legalization bill to become law without his signature. At least some marijuana products are legal for medical use in another 36 states. Legislators or voters have decriminalized marijuana possession in 16 states.

Opponents of legalization measures have focused their campaigns in most states on two chief objections: That legalization will lead to an increase in drugged driving, and that corporations that would eventually profit from legalization are funding the campaigns.

“Big Pot is going all out in funding these races this year after suffering defeats in state legislatures and in Congress this year,” said Kevin Sabet, a former official in the Office of Drug Control Policy who heads Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an anti-legalization group. “The overwhelming majority of funding for most of these measures have come from out of state.”

Voters appear poised to notch gains in at least two states: Two polls in Arizona, conducted by Monmouth University and Phoenix-based OH Predictive Insights, show Proposition 207 passing by 18 and 20-point margins. A poll conducted for a New Jersey law firm that backs legalization found Public Question 1 passing by a more than 2 to 1 margin.

Arizona is one of the few states where voters have defeated legalization ballot measures in the past. In 2016, voters rejected Proposition 205 by a slim 2.5-percentage point margin.

But this year, the business community that funded much of the 2016 opposition campaign is otherwise engaged. Most of their money has flowed into opposition to Proposition 208, a measure that would increase taxes on individuals making more than $250,000 a year. The current iteration of the legal marijuana measure also makes clear that edibles and other marijuana products that key swing voters object to will not be allowed.

“The no campaign is very anemic compared to what it was in 2016,” said Mike Noble, a Phoenix-based pollster. “Even among suburban women, it’s not nearly as negative as where it was in 2016.”

Public opinion on legalizing marijuana has changed dramatically over the last two decades. At the turn of the century, just 31 percent of Americans favored legalization, according to a Gallup poll. The last time Gallup asked the question, in October 2019, two-thirds of Americans said marijuana use should be legal.

“It’s not as scary as it once was,” Hamburger said. “Anybody who’s been watching the issue over the last six years would observe that the stigma, to whatever extent it existed, has been reduced.”

Some pro-legalization advocates have already turned to a new focus: For the first time this year, measures that would legalize or decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms will appear on the ballot, in both Oregon and Washington, D.C.

New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday that he had started his career covering the Lebanese civil war and added, “I’m terrified to find myself ending my career as a journalist covering America’s potential second civil war in its history.”

Friedman also described Trump’s recent comments as a “six-alarm fire.”

Trump has been beating the drum about what he characterizes as the dangers of mail-in voting for months, despite the lack of credible evidence that postal votes are any more susceptible to fraud than voting in person.

The current furor was sparked when Trump was asked during an appearance in the White House briefing room Wednesday whether he would commit to a peaceful transition of power and replied, “We’re going to have to see what happens.”

Asked about those comments the following day, the president said, “We want to make sure the election is honest, and I’m not sure it can be.”

There is no obvious legal mechanism by which he could do such a thing, and the Constitution provides that the election’s winner will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20. Any attempt to defy that process — itself an unlikely prospect — would mean Trump risking his ejection from the White House, perhaps at the hands of the Secret Service.

A Wall Street Journal editorial on Friday called the idea of Trump remaining in power in such circumstances “preposterous.”

A more plausible scenario, in the eyes of many, is Trump casting doubt on the election results and stoking resentment among his supporters with claims that victory is being stolen from him. Such statements those could pitch the nation into serious strife, even assuming Trump accedes to handing over power come Jan. 20.

The electoral implications of Trump’s remarks may turn out to be slight, given how energized Democratic voters are about defeating him and how fervently his base supports him.

But Curbelo, the former Florida congressman, suggested the controversy could backfire with some voters in the Sunshine State, the biggest and most crucial battleground.

In an apparent reference to immigrant communities from nations such as Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, Curbelo said, “There are communities in South Florida where there are a lot of families who fled countries where democratic institutions were weakened or destroyed. This could really push those voters who may not be enthusiastic about Biden. They may be wary about socialism from the left, but this will make them wary of authoritarianism from the right.”

Whether or not Trump’s comments have that effect on the election, though, they clearly mark another voyage into uncharted waters for the nation at large.

On Sunday, after initially refusing to answer pointed questions about the president's symptoms, White House physician Sean Conley revealed that Trump's condition had deteriorated to the point that he was given supplemental oxygen as well as the steroid dexamethasone, which has been used largely to treat severe cases of COVID-19.

Appearing at Walter Reed on Monday just moments after Pelosi spoke, Conley said Trump was clear to leave the facility and return to the White House. The president had not experienced a fever in 72 hours, Conley said, and his oxygen levels ""are all normal.""

""Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations, and most importantly his clinical status, support the president's safe return home, where he'll be surrounded by world-class medical care 24/7,"" he said.

Conley has come under heavy scrutiny from the medical community for what some consider an overly rosy depiction of Trump's condition and recuperation. Pelosi on Monday piled on, suggesting the president's medical team is taking marching orders from Trump rather than delivering sound evaluations.

""I hope that we could trust them, but what is disconcerting is that we know that the president's physicians present a report that must be approved by the president,"" she said. ""That's not scientific. That is not what the public is owed about the state of health of the president of the United States.""

Conley on Sunday defended his reluctance to provide details a day earlier, saying he didn't want to relay ""any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction.""

""I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president, over his course of illness, has had,"" he said.

That argument fell flat with a number of Democrats who have called for full transparency regarding Trump's health from the start.

Amid the nation's infatuation with Trump's illness and recuperation, party leaders in Washington are still fighting to secure an agreement on another round of emergency coronavirus stimulus.

Pelosi later suggested the pair is making progress but declined to say if a deal is possible this week.

""One way or another — it depends on if they really want to crush the virus, honor our heroes and put money in the pockets of the American people,"" she said.

House Democrats had passed a $2.2 trillion package last week, and Pelosi has so far held firm at that number. But the proposal was rejected by Mnuchin and Republicans in the administration who offered a $1.6 trillion counterproposal — a figure Democrats deem too low to address the ongoing health and economic crisis.

This includes speeches to the Wisconsin state legislature and a church in Texas in September and a speech Saturday at an event for the anti-abortion advocacy organization the Florida Family Policy Council.

Pompeo was originally expected to deliver his remarks in person, where attendees paid upward of $10,000 for tickets to secure a personal visit with the secretary, CNN reported.

But his participation in the event one month before the election is adding to outrage from congressional Democrats with oversight of foreign affairs. Trump is trailing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE in Florida, according to the most recent poll published by Siena College and The New York Times.

“It is concerning that the Secretary is suddenly crisscrossing the country at taxpayers’ expense to speak with state legislators and private groups and that these events appear to be increasing in frequency as the November 3rd election approaches,” Engel and Castro wrote in the letter.

It was sent to Undersecretary of State for Management Brian Bulatao and acting Legal Adviser Marik String, two close allies of Pompeo.

The documents requested by House Democrats builds on an investigation launched in August over whether Pompeo violated the Hatch Act by delivering pre-recorded remarks to the Republican National Convention while he was on diplomatic travel in Israel.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Hatch Act prohibits federal officials from using their government positions for partisan political activity. In July, Pompeo sent out communications and guidance to State Department employees barring staff from participating in political activity.

But the secretary has defended his speech to the convention from Jerusalem, saying he did so in his personal capacity and that he was given the green light from the State Department legal team that determined his participation was “lawful.”

Democrats have rejected this reasoning out of hand.

“The Secretary of State is our country’s top diplomat, responsible for representing all of America to the rest of the world, not the narrow interests of a particular president or political party,” Engel and Castro wrote in the letter.

The Democratic lawmakers also raised concern that Reince Preibus, President Trump’s former chief of staff and the former chairman of the Republican Party, traveled with Pompeo to his speech in Wisconsin last month. Preibus's involvement was first reported by CNN.

Pompeo’s speech to Wisconsin’s state legislature, which Wisconsin Democrats boycotted for violating health guidelines related to COVID-19, was billed as an awareness campaign to threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party.

But the secretary’s participation was criticized as a stump speech for the president in a key swing state.

Polls taken before the presidential debate and Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis showed the president trailing Biden in Wisconsin.

“The nexus of speeches about the Secretary’s personal religious beliefs, to a swing-state legislature accompanied by a former senior Republican party official, and at a paid-access event for an anti-abortion advocacy group, to the Secretary’s official duties as America’s lead diplomat is unclear and possibly illegal,” Engel and Castro wrote in their letter.

The lawmakers called for the State Department to hand over any legal guidance related to Pompeo’s speeches at a church in Texas on Sept. 20, his speech to the Wisconsin legislature Sept. 25 and his speech to the Florida Family Policy Council on Oct. 3.

The lawmakers are also raising concern over what orders Trump is giving Pompeo on such speeches and is requesting communications from the White House to the State Department. They noted in their letter that the State Department’s legal team had reviewed in 2019 a request by Trump for Pompeo to participate in a campaign rally. The secretary had declined to participate over the legal concerns, according to Castro, who raised the issue in a foreign affairs hearing last month.

The records request is yet another benchmark of tensions between House Democrats and Pompeo, who have clashed repeatedly.

Engel has stepped back from holding Pompeo in contempt, halting procedures last month following the delayed delivery to House Democrats of tens of thousands of documents from the State Department related to an investigation being conducted by Senate Republicans.

Democrats are also investigating whether it was politically motivated when State Department Inspector General Steve Linick was fired by Trump in mid-May at Pompeo’s request.

Linick was conducting at least two investigations into Pompeo’s conduct at the agency at the time. An investigation into Pompeo’s use of an emergency declaration to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and without the approval from Congress was published in August and affirmed that the secretary acted within his legal authority, although Democrats have raised concerns that the reports findings suggest a manufactured emergency to justify the arms sales.

The second investigation, into whether Pompeo and his wife misused federal resources for personal benefit, is believed to be ongoing.",2020-10-05 13:52:03-04:00,
Democratic leaders: Supreme Court fight is about ObamaCare,"House Democratic leaders on Tuesday hurled charges that President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE and Senate Republicans are racing to seat a ninth Supreme Court justice for a virtually singular purpose: to repeal ObamaCare.

The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Nov. 10 on a lawsuit contending that a central part of former President Obama's 2010 health care expansion was unconstitutional and that therefore the law, officially called the Affordable Care Act, should be scrapped in its entirety.

Trump and Senate GOP leaders are scrambling to nominate and approve a conservative jurist ahead of those arguments to fill the vacancy created by Friday's death of long-time Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Ruth Bader GinsburgThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law Ginsburg's granddaughter cuts election ad for progressive group: 'Make her voice heard at the ballot box' The truth, the whole truth about protecting preexisting conditions MORE, a liberal stalwart.

The move would shift the ideological split on the high court from 5-4 to 6-3, in favor of conservatives, lending a new advantage to the GOP-led states that have lodged the ObamaCare challenge, legal experts say.

Democrats maintain it's that particular case that's driving the GOP's urgency.

""This fight for a Supreme Court justice really is about health care, and the upcoming ACA hearing,"" she said.

Ginsburg's death has sparked a firestorm of controversy on Capitol Hill, as Senate Republicans race to replace her before the November election. The decision marks a 180-degree reversal from 2016, when Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE (R-Ky.), had blocked Obama's pick to fill a similar vacancy during an election year, citing the preeminence of lending voters the power to decide the next president first.

""Of course — of course — the American people should have a say,"" McConnell said at the time.

McConnell and Senate Republicans contend that this year is unlike 2016 because the same party controls the White House and the Senate.

But the head-snapping reversal by McConnell and Senate Republicans has led to charges — from Democrats and even some Republican critics — that GOP leaders are hypocrites defying their own standards of fairness and democracy in order to ram through a conservative judge before voters have the opportunity to weigh in.

""What matters most to Donald Trump, and Mitch McConnell ... is power — not saving lives or jobs; not preventing millions of Americans from spilling into homelessness; not defending our Constitution,"" Clark said.

The lawsuit challenging ObamaCare targets the law's individual mandate, which had previously required patients to pay a financial penalty if they failed to buy health insurance. In a previous challenge, the Supreme Court had upheld the legality of the individual mandate, citing Congress's power to levy taxes. The swing vote in that case was Chief Justice John Roberts.

Yet Congress eliminated the financial penalty in 2017, gutting the enforcement mechanism even as the insurance mandate technically remains on the books. The plaintiff states maintain that a penalty of $0 can no longer constitute a tax. And if the individual mandate is unconstitutional, they continue, then so is the whole law.

Yet in an election year, in the midst of the coronavirus crisis that has killed 200,000 people in the United States alone, there is risk for the Republicans supporting the lawsuit — including Trump.

Experts have estimated that repealing ObamaCare would eliminate health coverage for more than 20 million people, while suddenly empowering insurance companies to charge higher premiums for those with pre-existing conditions — something prohibited under the Affordable Care Act.

Those dynamics have not been overlooked by Democrats, who are hoping the threat to the law will bring voters to their side at the polls in November.

""They don't have an alternative to the Affordable Care Act. They're in court right now trying to declare it unconstitutional and they want to put a justice on the Supreme Court who will strip away the protections that millions of Americans — over 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions — currently have under law,"" Jeffries said, noting that those who have contracted COVID-19 would fit that category.

The reason, Jeffries added, is ""in part because the president's response has been an unmitigated disaster.""",2020-09-22 14:10:51-04:00,

Trump vs. scientists. President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE began his news conference Wednesday evening by asking Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield to explain how he was “misquoted” in coverage of a Washington Post interview in which he said that the second wave of COVID-19 will be “more difficult.” Redfield said he was accurately quoted and tried to explain the nuanced differences between “worse” and “more difficult.” This is not the first time the White House has pushed back on the nation’s top scientists. Rick Bright, the doctor who led the federal agency involved in developing a vaccine for COVID-19 said Wednesday that he was removed from his post after pushing for more vetting of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug Trump and his allies have repeatedly pushed, despite a lack of evidence it treats the coronavirus. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, was nearly fired for publicly warning in February of a mass-scale pandemic hitting the U.S., according to The Wall Street Journal. She has since taken a far less public role in the government’s response to the virus.

So, who do we believe? As the country anxiously awaits a return to normalcy, the contrasting messages from the White House and the nation’s leading public health experts are at best, disconcerting. Should we put our trust in the Faucis and Birxs of the world, or should we trust our elected leaders who, with no experience in public health, are pushing to reopen the economy in lieu of COVID-19 concerns? After all, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) was perplexed to learn – long after it was initially reported – that the virus could be spread by asymptomatic carriers. He is now pushing for his state to reopen Friday. The decision of whose advice we heed could mean life or death for many.

THE HILL'S CORONAVIRUS REPORT



Welcome to The Hill's Coronavirus Report. It's Thursday, April 23.





Editor’s note.

I have been doing a daily commute between Chestertown, Md,. and Washington, D.C., to produce my daily Coronavirus Report interviews. Traffic, as one might expect, is negligible but there are still many making a 5 a.m. trek to jobs and obligations that are necessary to keep the nation’s capital functioning at some basic level. What impresses me both about the scene in D.C. and Chestertown, a small rural Colonial-era town, is how everyone I pass on the street or see from the car is practicing social distancing and standing in lines more than 6 feet apart outside the 17th Street coffee shop Three Fifty. When I walk on the street, people say hello, nod their heads forward in greeting, masks on. In Chestertown, where there are a number of restaurants that allow curbside or at-door pickup, people are wearing masks, and everyone seems to be their most generous self. This is not the D.C. I have known. Those small-town affectations of saying hello to those one doesn’t know have always been part of Chestertown. But for the district, it’s new — and I hope that that is one of the upticks in character that survives this COVID-19 debacle.

In my recent interviews with mayors and lawmakers, including Rep. Debbie Dingell Deborah (Debbie) Ann DingellCedric Richmond's next move: 'Sky's the limit' if Biden wins Pelosi, Mnuchin continue COVID-19 talks amid dwindling odds for deal Pocan won't seek another term as Progressive Caucus co-chair MORE (D-Mich.), Rep. Brad Wenstrup Brad Robert WenstrupTrump, Biden battle over rush for COVID-19 vaccine The Hill's Campaign Report: Biden asks if public can trust vaccine from Trump ahead of Election Day | Oklahoma health officials raised red flags before Trump rally One doctor's thoughts on a hopeful future MORE (R-Ohio), Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, I was struck how they each highlighted the importance of all of us being good to one another. They highlighted acts of kindness like restaurants in some areas of Seattle finding ways to feed those who have very little, donating blood plasma to very ill COVID-19 patients, helping depressed people and intervening in domestic violence situations. There are now more than 26 million newly unemployed people and even more than that if you count partially employed. This is a staggering number of people whose lives have been upended. We need to be aware of this hardship that so many in our community are experiencing and not lose track of them as economic stimulus packages and reopening society are debated.

Today my interview is with Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer’s president of worldwide research, development and medical and chief scientist. He is one of 20 scientists and pharmaceutical representatives who met President Trump in early March to discuss what needs to be done to have a vaccine, or multiple vaccines and anti-virals, in a breathtaking period of time and at a global scale. The seriousness Dolsten brings to this challenge is obvious in our conversation. But what he shared about how firms are sharing data and findings with each other in ways they have not done in this modern era makes one hopeful that the traditional multiyear calendar of discovering drugs, testing them scientifically and bringing them responsibly to market is being collapsed into a much shorter timeline. I asked Dolsten how the price of these drugs and their accessibility is going to be managed — and he said this is a historic, once a century pandemic and that we are going to have to get these therapies to everyone in need and who is ill. There’s a lot of criticism of pharmaceutical firms, but at a time like this, it’s also clear how absolutely essential these reservoirs of talent and engines of scientific research are. It’s a very interesting discussion, and I hope you watch.

"NY, NJ lawmakers call for more aid to help fight coronavirus","A bipartisan group of lawmakers from New Jersey and New York is calling for the creation of a fund to provide at least $40 billion to help their states mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

In a letter — led by Reps. Josh Gottheimer Joshua (Josh) GottheimerLawmakers hope election releases pressure on stimulus talks Trump fuels and frustrates COVID-19 relief talks Trump's illness sparks new urgency for COVID-19 deal MORE (D-N.J.), Chris Smith Christopher (Chris) Henry SmithWoman tased, arrested for trespassing for not wearing mask at Ohio football game China sanctioning Rubio, Cruz in retaliatory move over Hong Kong China sanctions Cruz, Rubio, others over Xinjiang legislation MORE (R-N.J.), Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), Pete King Peter (Pete) KingDemocrats, GOP fighting over largest House battlefield in a decade Treasury withheld nearly M from FDNY 9/11 health program Trump holds private funeral service for brother Robert Trump at White House MORE (R-N.Y.), Hakeem Jeffries Hakeem Sekou JeffriesA tearful lesson of 2016: Polls don't matter if people don't vote Overnight Health Care: House Democrats slam pharma CEOs for price hikes driven by revenue, executive bonuses | Ex-FDA employees express worries to Congress over politicization of vaccines | Fauci said his mask stance was 'taken out of context' by Trump Top House Democrat: Parties 'much closer' to a COVID deal 'than we've ever been' MORE (D-N.Y.) and Tom Reed Thomas (Tom) W. ReedAn investment in R&D is an investment in America's future Pelosi and Trump go a full year without speaking Trump fuels and frustrates COVID-19 relief talks MORE (R-N.Y.) — sent to Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided?

“We request that a separate fund of at least $40 billion be created in the interim emergency COVID-19 relief package and it be allocated among the States based upon their share of the national infection rate according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracking data on April 10, 2020,” they wrote.

“This $40 billion fund would be independent of other proposed state and local stabilization funds using traditional population-based formulas. This proposed formula for disbursing the $40 billion fund will provide assistance to the most impacted states,” they added.

The group noted that just under half of the cases seen in the United States have taken place in the two states, yet they have only received 9 percent in federal aid to hospitals despite the disproportionate burden they’ve faced.

“We need to provide resources to our states proportionate to the burden they bear. Currently, New York and New Jersey have a combined number of 208,100 cases of COVID 19, or 45 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the country,” the letter reads.

“As of April 10th, our states have more confirmed cases than the next 18 highest states combined. New York and New Jersey are not alone in the suffering and costs of responding to the pandemic, but federal aid has not been allocated proportionately to the impact of the virus,” the lawmakers wrote.

The lawmakers cautioned that without changing the formula on how aid is distributed in the next relief package, it could have grave consequences in the states’ economies and health care systems.

“The current and historical funding formulas used by the federal government are insufficient in the face of this global epidemic. New York and New Jersey need substantial emergency funding in order to fill budgetary holes for critical services during this crisis,” they wrote.

“Without adequate, and proportional assistance, we fear that our states will be forced to cut services, such as health care, education, nutrition, first responders, free and fair elections, and transportation. In addition, this pandemic has negatively impacted the finances of our counties, cities, towns and villages,” they added.

The lawmakers stressed that local governments are facing hardships due to the financial fallout caused by the pandemic, adding that they believe it’s critical that the next bill includes language to help them stay afloat.

“Economically, the business shut down has resulted in reduced sales tax revenues, permit fees, and other local levies. It is also likely that many unemployed landowners will be unable to pay their property taxes, adding even more stress to local budgets,” they wrote.

“Our local governments have also felt the added financial strain of responding directly to COVID-19 as they struggle to meet the needs of the hospitals, police, EMTs and other emergency services. This has resulted in increased expenses for our local governments and we therefore support a separate stabilization fund to address their fiscal needs,” they added.

As top lawmakers look to pass a fourth coronavirus relief measure in coming weeks, Gottheimer noted the strain hospitals in his district have seen since the start of the outbreak

“New Jersey has continued to see a very high caseload, we've got 68,000 cases statewide — in my district which has been hit the hardest we've got 16,000 cases and lost more than 600 people. So as you know some states like Montana. I'm not sure what the numbers are, but thankfully, have not been hit nearly as hard as the whole state and my district's been hit,” he told The Hill in an interview Wednesday.

“So, you start to look at these numbers and you say, just like we would with the natural disaster when a hurricane hits, or a tornado hits, and we focus on where it landed. And unfortunately for us, the eye of the storm has been on our states in the region. And then we should make sure that the resources are allocated going forward,” he added.

The New Jersey Democrat said while the curve is beginning to flatten, it’s critical that Congress act quickly to pass legislation that includes provisions aimed at helping combat all aspects of the crisis.

“You can't have your head in the sand about reality here, and reality is we're getting crushed in New Jersey in New York. We've got so many cases and lost so many lives, and yes, the curve is flattening because of the measures we've taken but you still just yesterday had thousands more who are sick, and lost thousands of more people yesterday,” he said.

“We must help our small businesses right we must have a plan to get back to work that we're developing, which we need as well, right, which is a central position economic crisis, not just a health crisis, but to pass anything right now that does not take into account the multiple fronts that are what that we're dealing with, it's just incredulous to me,” he added.

"Obama hits trail to help Biden, protect legacy","When former President Obama hits the trail on Wednesday, he'll be campaigning not just for his onetime partner Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE but for his own policies that have been severed under President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE.

In two campaign stops in Philadelphia, Obama is expected to rail against Trump like no other Democrat has during this campaign cycle, making the case for why the country can't afford to have a second Trump term.

“President Obama understands more intensely than anyone what’s at stake this election as Donald Trump has systematically attacked his legacy every day since taking office nearly four years ago,” said Democratic strategist Joel Payne.

Behind the scenes, Obama has been beyond miffed with Trump’s focus on dismantling his policies and has told anyone who will listen how repulsed he is by Trump and the way he has governed.

“He finds this presidency completely and utterly reprehensible,” said one source close to the former president.

Obama has largely avoided getting into confrontations with Trump over the past four years, in part because past presidents have sought to shy from criticizing their successors, but also to avoid becoming a foil for the GOP.

Yet he has also been picking his spots to weigh in and offered harsh criticism of Trump and an assessment of the stakes in the election during a speech at the Democratic convention in August.

Obama’s appearances in the coming two weeks provide the former president with ample opportunity to protect his own legacy, other strategists say.

“Although Biden is the one running, a lot of the work they did together in the Obama administration is what’s on the line,” said Democratic strategist Eddie Vale, who pointed to health care and the environment as two major policies areas which have been rolled back under Trump. “It’s already been under severe attack by Republicans and likely couldn’t survive another four years of Trump.”

On Tuesday, as Obama prepared to hit the trail, the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee held a virtual hearing to examine efforts to expand access to coverage, even as the Trump administration has rolled back outreach and advertising.

Subcommittee Chairman Bill Pascrell William (Bill) James PascrellDemocrats express concerns about IRS readiness for next year's filing season Obama hits trail to help Biden, protect legacy Trump's COVID-19 case draws new attention to handling of pandemic MORE (D-N.J.) hammered Republicans for continuing to attack the law, even as they pledge to protect people with pre-existing conditions.

“I just want to remind everyone: The administration is in court right now demanding to destroy the ACA [Affordable Care Act]. The administration is fighting to remove health care protections from millions during a pandemic,” Pascrell said.

Republicans in the hearing pointed to the fact that the law has not collapsed and that premiums are falling. They touted actions taken by the Trump administration like promoting cheap, short-term health plans and the elimination of the law's individual mandate penalty.

When Obama takes the stage on Wednesday, his appearance will be different than his campaign events in the past because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. At one event, Obama will speak at a drive-in rally similar to events Biden has done where attendees — who received invitations from the campaign — will listen from their cars at a sports complex lot.

A source close to Obama said the former president will highlight the historic stakes of this election, emphasize the urgency of voting early and discuss the importance of down ballot races.

“I think it’ll lose some of the potency of a traditional Obama rally,” said one Democratic strategist. “He feeds off of large crowds. That’s when he gets most fired up and that might get a little lost in a parking lot rally.”

Still, the strategist added that Democrats have been long anticipating a chance when they would hear from Obama.

“He’s been waiting for this moment for four years,” the strategist added. “He’s been waiting for a chance to rip Trump to shreds. And bringing Obama out will only cause Trump to spiral which is also what Democrats want.

In 2016, Obama, together with Michelle Obama Michelle LeVaughn Robinson ObamaObama shooting 3-pointer while campaigning for Biden goes viral Michelle Obama releases her voting playlist Obama to young voters: Create 'a new normal in America' by voting for Biden MORE, campaigned for Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE in Philadelphia on the final night before the presidential election. Even though the Obamas and Clintons drew a crowd of thousands that night, it didn’t help Clinton the following day, when she lost the state of Pennsylvania to Trump.

Democrats say they have been working in overdrive to make sure they can bring the state back to their side of the ledger.

Obama, who delivered his convention speech from Philadelphia, is a part of that plan.

Political observers say Obama, in particular, feels the weight of this moment almost more than anyone else.

“I think that Obama feels that very much hangs in the balance, for the country but also for his legacy,” said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. “President Trump in many ways has been antithetical to what he stood for, in terms of how the presidency should be conducted, and his policy agenda.""

“He feels a sense of urgency to help Biden win,” Zelizer said. “And in his case it goes far beyond partisanship.”

Pascrell easily defeated Zinovia Spezakis, the director of Ecolectro, Inc., a clean tech company, and Alp Basaran, founder of a strategic capital advising firm.

Chamber-backed Democrats embrace endorsements in final stretch,"Almost two dozen House Democrats are embracing their recent endorsements by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as their GOP challengers ramp up criticisms of the pro-business lobbying group that has also drawn the ire of the Trump administration.

Many of the first-year Democratic lawmakers, who flipped Republican seats in 2018, have welcomed the group’s endorsement by putting out press releases and tweeting about the support.

Rep. Joe Cunningham Joseph CunninghamDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts Georgia Republican Drew Ferguson tests positive for COVID-19 Democrats see Green New Deal yielding gains despite GOP attacks MORE (D-S.C.) said he was honored and “will continue to support policies that create jobs, promote growth, and reignite our economy.”

Rep. Abigail Spanberger Abigail Davis SpanbergerDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts Democrats seek wave to bolster House majority During pandemic, 'telehealth' emerging as important lifeline to connect patients with caregivers MORE (D-Va.) said she is “proud to be on the side of our region’s small and medium-sized businesses” and citied her support for the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement and for the Paycheck Protection Program.

The Chamber’s endorsements are determined by a lawmaker’s scorecard, which measures how often their congressional votes align with the Chamber’s priorities. Many of the endorsements stemmed from support for the USMCA, a measure the Chamber spent heavily on during the 116th Congress.

But the group’s decision last month to reward 23 first-term Democrats with endorsements was quickly bashed by Republicans, with President Trump reportedly asking CEO Tom Donohue if they were a “done deal.” First-term House Republicans earned just a few more endorsements, at 29.

Some observers have argued that the Democratic endorsements are a sign that the Chamber doesn’t see Republicans winning back the House in November, a view shared by political handicappers.

Still, GOP challengers looking to unseat the two dozen Democratic incumbents have blasted the Chamber, which traditionally supports Republican candidates, for backing their opponents.

Davids's race with Adkins is listed as a “likely Democrat” by the Cook Political Report.

Genevieve Collins, a businesswoman challenging Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas), said the Chamber has “completely lost its way.”

“When I speak to business owners large and small here in the 32nd district, they don’t care about an endorsement from the disconnected and bloated D.C. special interest U.S. Chamber,” Collins said, the Dallas Morning News reported.

Allred's race with Collins is also listed as “likely Democrat” by Cook.

“The U.S. Chamber, without asking for input from the Hampton Roads or Virginia Chambers, graded Elaine and other liberal Democrats on a curve and gave them participation trophies. The reality of Luria’s actual voting record is anti-business and would harm our economy and reduce our jobs,” he said in a statement.

Luria represents a district Trump won by 3 points. Her race with Taylor is listed as a toss-up by the Cook Political Report.

Seven of the 23 Democrats who received endorsements are competing in races deemed a ""Toss Up"" by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.

Twenty of the 23 flipped GOP seats in 2018, and 13 represent districts that Trump won in 2016.

Neil Bradley, Chamber executive vice president and chief policy officer, defended the endorsements.

“For the last 108 years, the role of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been to advance the priorities of the business community and our members,” he told The Hill on Friday. “In the political arena, the Chamber will continue to endorse candidates from both sides of the aisle with a proven track record and vision to support public policy that will bolster economic growth.”

In the same month that the Chamber unveiled its endorsements, it also forced out its top political adviser, Scott Reed, saying that an internal review found that he breached confidentiality, distorted, withheld information from leadership and leaked internal information to the press.

“Our decision is not based on a disagreement over political strategy but rather it is the result of Reed's actions,” a spokesman said at the time.

The controversy surrounding the endorsements also puts local chambers in a tough spot.

Kendra Horn Kendra Suzanne HornDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts Biden's oil stance jars Democrats in tough races Biden: 'I would transition from the oil industry' MORE (D-Okla.), saying her record is not pro-business.

“I question how the U.S. Chamber could endorse a candidate who consistently voted against the largest industry in Oklahoma, employing over 90,000 workers throughout the state. That is hardly a pro-business record,” Warmington said, the Oklahoman reported.

More recently, the U.S. Chamber has not only endorsed more Republicans, it’s also started running ads in their support.

Former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE and Sen.

Introducing his newly minted running mate, Biden heaped praise on the California Democrat and celebrated the historic possibility of electing the first vice president of color. Biden championed Harris’s qualifications, arguing she is the right candidate to join him and is ready to tackle a role he himself held for eight years.

“She knows how to govern, how to make the hard calls, and she’s ready to do the job on day one,"" Biden said.

Biden and Harris used the event to tear into Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, a bruised and battered economy, and the racial tensions that have been intensified in recent months. As The Hill’s Jonathan Easley notes, the two anchored their attacks to the third anniversary of the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. It’s the event Biden has said prompted him to mount his third campaign for the presidency.

“The president’s mismanagement of the pandemic has plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and we’re experiencing a moral reckoning with racism and systemic injustice that has brought a new coalition of conscience to the streets of our country,” Harris said. “America is crying out for leadership.”

""[Trump] inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaA wave election? Or a fundamental realigning of American politics? If it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Pittsburgh newspaper backs Trump in first GOP presidential endorsement since 1972 MORE and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground,"" Harris added.

The Associated Press: Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick.

The Hill: Biden hits back after Trump's attacks on Harris.

Throughout the event in Wilmington, Del., the outsize role of the coronavirus pandemic was laid bare. In normal times, the unveiling of a running mate has been marked by a massive rally, followed by the subsequent criss-crossing to events across key battleground states and the party’s conventions.

None of that was (or will be) the case, as Biden and Harris appeared in the gymnasium of Alexis I. duPont High School wearing masks and practiced social distancing throughout the event, which took place without a crowd. The Democratic pair then took part in a virtual fundraiser.

The Harris announcement also proved to be a financial winner: the Biden campaign raised $26 million in its first day, according to the former vice president.

The New York Times: Biden and Harris’s incident-free, audience-free debut.

John F. Harris, Politico founding editor: The epic blandness of the Joe Biden campaign.

With the Democratic ticket off and running, Republicans are grappling with how best to attack Harris, with the first 24 hours serving as a prime example as Trump allies were unable to come up with a cohesive message against the presumptive vice presidential nominee. As Brett Samuels documents, the Trump campaign derided her as “weak on crime,” yet also played up her self-described role as a “top cop” when she served as California's attorney general.

On Tuesday, Trump labeled Harris as “nasty” for her questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughIf it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Vermont secretary of State says Kavanaugh's correction still unsatisfactory Kavanaugh corrects opinion in voting case following Vermont official's objection MORE, even as the campaign worries such rhetoric could turn off the suburban voters Trump needs to secure a second term in office.

LEADING THE DAY





CONGRESS: Negotiations on a massive coronavirus relief package remained at a stalemate on Wednesday, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided? Not on everything On The Money: McConnell says Congress will take up stimulus package at start of 2021 | Lawmakers see better prospects for COVID deal after election MORE (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerDemocrats on edge as Biden-Trump fight nears end Reestablishing American prosperity by investing in the 'Badger Belt' House Democrats introduce bill to invest 0 billion in STEM research and education MORE (D-N.Y.) charging that White House negotiators have no interest in meeting them halfway to reach an accord.

Early Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinDemocrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Trump, Biden set for weekend swing state sprint Mnuchin says he learned of Pelosi's letter to him about stimulus talks 'in the press' MORE told Fox Business that the two Democratic leaders are “unwilling to compromise,” pointing to their repeated need for nearly $1 trillion in funding for state and local governments.

“Our view is let's spend a little over $1 trillion on areas of the economy that are going to be very impactful now that we can agree on,"" Mnuchin said. ""If we need to do more, we'll come back and do more and work together.”

The remarks prompted a rebuke from Pelosi and Schumer hours later, with the pair saying in a statement that Mnuchin pushed for a new meeting on an aid package but showed no willingness to move off the administration’s negotiating position. They added that any deal needs to be in the ballpark of $2 trillion — a figure Republicans remain reluctant to approach.

“An overture was made by Secretary Mnuchin to meet and he made clear that his televised comments from earlier today still stand: the White House is not budging from their position concerning the size and scope of a legislative package,” Pelosi and Schumer said. “Democrats have compromised. … We have again made clear to the Administration that we are willing to resume negotiations once they start to take this process seriously” (The Hill).

Adding to the rhetoric, the president panned Pelosi and Schumer for wanting “ridiculous” items in the bill, including funds for mail-in voting in November.

“Nancy and Chuck haven’t provided anything,” Trump said. “They don’t want to give anything.”

The Washington Post: Mnuchin’s latest overture to Pelosi goes nowhere, and relief talks stall again.

The Associated Press: Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsSunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day Biden and Trump closing arguments diverge sharply on COVID-19 Democrats call Trump's COVID-19 response 'among the worst failures of leadership in American history' MORE moves from deal breaker to deal-maker?

As The Hill’s Jordain Carney writes, lawmakers are barreling toward a rocky September. With no deal in sight, the perfect storm of legislative matters looms as coronavirus relief discussions could collide with a push to avoid a government shutdown only weeks before the general election.

Lawmakers are already discussing trying to merge coronavirus funding and a continuing resolution just weeks before Election Day, with Pelosi saying that they want a COVID-19 deal before the funding deadline, Sept. 30, but there's no end in sight for the stalemate between the two sides.

The Hill: Pelosi says COVID-19 aid can't wait until September: “People will die.”

Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal: Checks and balances erode as Trump flexes power of the purse.

IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES





CORONAVIRUS: Trump, eager to nudge schools to open this fall for classroom rather than online instruction, on Wednesday unveiled basic hygiene and other precautions suggested to U.S. schools in the form of formal guidance meant to increase precautions against the transmission of the coronavirus.

At a Wednesday event at the White House, Trump said, “Virtual is not as good as being there. Virtual is just not the same thing” (Reuters). He continued during an evening press briefing, asserting that children are short-changed with virtual learning: “When you sit alone in a basement looking at a computer, your brain starts to wither away.”

The New York Times: 1,193 people have been quarantined in Georgia because students returned to schools with COVID-19 infections, setting off chains of precautionary events. Also in Tennessee, Mississippi and Indiana, for example, suburban and rural schools opened their doors weeks ago.

The Associated Press: School boards are at the heart of the coronavirus-reopening debate in schools.

The Associated Press: At one university in North Carolina, police recently broke up an off-campus student party with 400 people. It was one of 20 parties at which the university police intervened because young people did not heed rules and precautions against COVID-19 transmission.

> Treatments: Companies are rushing to test drugs that deliver antibodies to fight COVID-19 without having to train the immune system to make them. These drugs, given through an IV, are believed to last for a month or more. They could give quick, temporary immunity to people at high risk of infection, such as health workers and housemates of someone with the coronavirus. If they prove effective and if a vaccine doesn’t materialize or fails to work as hoped, the drugs might eventually be considered for wider use, perhaps for teachers or other groups (The Associated Press).

> Dental health during the pandemic: The World Health Organization, in newly released interim guidance on Wednesday, recommended that people delay routine, nonessential dental care until coronavirus transmission rates in patients’ communities are reduced or until national or local officials suggest otherwise. The guidance prompted a rebuttal from the American Dental Association (The Washington Post).

> Bars and restaurants: Eating out. Drinking out. Family gatherings. During the pandemic, these simple pleasures have proved to be dangerous. Data from states and cities shows that many community outbreaks of the coronavirus this summer have centered on restaurants and bars. The clusters seen in data from Louisiana, Maryland, Colorado and other states as well as major cities are worrisome to health officials because many restaurant and bar employees across the country are in their 20s and can carry the virus home and possibly seed household transmissions, which have soared in recent weeks through the Sun Belt and the West. There are no simple answers or solutions for patrons, owners, employees and communities (The New York Times).

> Dog dies from COVID-19: An 8-year-old dog that tested positive for the coronavirus in North Carolina, according to laboratory tests, died this month after suffering respiratory distress. A member of the household had previously tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently tested negative. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said there is currently no evidence that pets play a significant role in transmission of the virus (ABC News).

> Sports: The Kentucky Derby, which is scheduled on Sept. 5, decided to move ahead with some social distancing precautions at Churchill Downs because of the coronavirus and will limit spectators to fewer than 23,000 (USA Today). … Augusta National Golf Club announced on Wednesday that The Masters, set to take place Nov. 12-15, will be held without fans (The Associated Press). … The Washington Football Team will play the 2020 football season without fans at FedEx Field. “The well-being of those supporters, along with that of our players, coaches and each and every member of our gameday staff is simply too important, and the current knowledge of COVID-19 too unpredictable, to welcome our fan base to FedEx Field to start the season,” owner Dan Snyder said on Wednesday (Yahoo Sports). … The Dallas Cowboys plan to play all their home games this season in front of fans, owner Jerry Jones said on Wednesday (NBC Sports).

The administration ignored calls from European Union officials and rejected an appeal this week from U.S. lawmakers to drop tariffs on food, wine and spirits from the EU, but did not add tariffs to vodka, gin and beer, as it had threatened (Reuters). … U.S. Wine Trade Alliance President Ben Aneff did not mince words in a stern statement of objection released on Wednesday. “This decision highlights serious questions about how the USTR is currently damaging small, mom-and-pop restaurants and wine businesses throughout our nation, at the height of the worst pandemic in a century,” Aneff said. “The USTR also owes Boeing an explanation. The agency continues to deal out more punishment to small, unrelated U.S. businesses than to Airbus, the recipient of the illegal subsidies at the heart of this dispute.”

➔ Courts: Federal prosecutors charged three men on Wednesday with threatening and intimidating women who have accused Grammy Award-winning artist R. Kelly of sexual misconduct. Among those charged are an adviser of Kelly who threatened to release sexually-explicit pictures of a woman who filed suit against the musician, and a friend who offered $500,000 to a victim to not cooperate with prosecutors (The Associated Press and The Hill).

➔ Administration: Six former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from both parties are calling for a “reset” at the EPA in an open letter published on Wednesday (The Hill). …One of Trump’s pet peeves is a federal regulation affecting water conservation through showerheads.

The secretary said in his remarks that China is a more significant danger to Czech democracy than Russia. The secretary appeared with Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (pictured below) (Politico).

“When former Vice President Joe Biden began thinking of potential running mates this spring, one of the first people to come to mind was Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).”

WHAT TO KNOW:

Three pros:

Choosing Harris is historic. She is a strong debater. She is a low-risk choice for Biden. https://bit.ly/2PM8zis

Three cons:

Her own presidential campaign flopped. She dropped out two months before Iowa. One of her strongest moments was at Biden’s expense during a debate. She is not the most progressive pick, and liberals may not be excited.

Trump expressed doubt to donors GOP can hold Senate: report,"President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE privately told donors at a Nashville, Tenn., fundraiser on Thursday that he thinks it will be “very tough” for Republicans to keep their majority in the Senate, adding that he would not support certain GOP senators, according to The Washington Post.

The fundraiser was held the same night of the final presidential debate, which also took place in Nashville.

“I think the Senate is tough actually. The Senate is very tough,” Trump said at the Nashville Marriott event, an attendee told the Post. “There are a couple senators I can’t really get involved in. I just can’t do it. You lose your soul if you do. I can’t help some of them. I don’t want to help some of them.”

The attendee spoke to the news outlet on the condition of anonymity because the event was a private, closed-door gathering.

The Hill has reached out to the White House and representatives of the Trump campaign for comment.

During Thursday’s presidential debate, Trump said he believes Republicans will instead take back control of the House, where Democrats currently hold a majority.

""I think we're going to win the House,"" Trump said, speaking from the debate stage in Nashville.

He later said that he believes his party will take back the House in part because of the behavior of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats poised for House gains with boost from Trump-won districts America divided?

However, Republicans would need a net gain of 18 seats to flip the House on Election Day, and Inside Elections has projected Democrats will pick up a net of 10 to 20 seats in the lower chamber. The Cook Political Report has also predicted Democrats are likely to expand their majority.

When it comes to the Senate, however, the Post reported that some strategists believe that Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as his behavior in the first presidential debate, have helped shift races in favor of Democrats.

Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority in the upper chamber. Should Democratic nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE win the presidency, Democrats would need to gain three seats to claim a Senate majority.

The Post reported that National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) spokesman Jesse Hunt expressed doubt about the idea that Trump does not support some Senate Republicans.

“The Republican-led Senate and President Trump have had a great partnership over the last four years, highlighted by the fact the chamber is poised to confirm a third Trump Supreme Count [Court] nominee in the coming days,” Hunt told the Post Saturday, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law More veterans running for office as numbers dwindle in Congress 'Saturday Night Live' warns of Trump reelection in Halloween tale MORE’s (R-Ky.) efforts to hold a Senate vote on Amy Coney Barrett Amy Coney BarrettThe Trump court and the erosion of environmental law If it's not an Electoral College legal fight, it's a blow-out — here are the counties to watch Pittsburgh newspaper backs Trump in first GOP presidential endorsement since 1972 MORE’s confirmation on Monday.

The NRSC did not immediately respond to The Hill’s requests for comment Saturday.

Mandi Merritt, National Press Secretary for the Republican National Committee (RNC) told The Hill that, ""The enthusiasm for President Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot remains sky high.""

""The RNC has built the biggest and most sophisticated Get Out The Vote program in history, and we are confident that voters will turn out to elect Republicans as they understand what is at stake this election - freedom and prosperity under President Trump and Republicans, or a ‘dark winter’ ahead under Joe Biden and Democrats,” she continued.

The data could serve as a warning sign for Trump, who won all three states in 2016.

“Joe Biden’s position in key swing states going into the final week suggests that Trump has so far been unable to generate enough momentum to close the gap,” said pollster Mark Penn Mark PennSunday shows preview: The final push to Election Day Countdown to victory — but whose?

“All three states remain in toss up range but increasing virus cases and massive Biden expenditures are making it hard for trump to gain traction,” he added.

Florida

Biden leads Trump by 3 points in Florida, 50 percent to 47 percent, within the poll’s margin of error. Three percent said they were unsure or did not know.

The data is reflective of other recent polling out of the Sunshine State showing a narrow contests.

A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday showed Biden up by 3 points in Florida, 45 percent to 42 percent.

The RealClearPolitics polling average shows Biden up by 7.7 percentage points.

While Biden continues to lead with Hispanic voters, his campaign is actively working to appeal more to Hispanic communities in the state given the narrow race unfolding.

Fifty-four percent of Hispanics polled in the state said they supported Biden, while 43 percent said they supported Trump, according to the poll.

“In Florida, Trump has a strong Latino vote for a Republican but has problems with senior women concerned about the [coronavirus],” Penn said.

Both candidates were out in force in Florida on Thursday, with Biden holding events in Tampa, which is located at one end of the state’s crucial I-4 corridor. The former vice president also held a rally in Broward County, Fla.

Biden noted concerns about the coronavirus in the state on Thursday, pledging that he would work to “shut the virus down.”

Fifty-five percent of Florida voters said they believe Biden will do a better job at handling the pandemic, while 45 percent said they same about Trump, according to the poll.

Pennsylvania

In Pennsylvania, Biden leads Trump 51 percent to 46 percent, according to the poll. Three percent said they were not sure or did not know who they would vote for.

Biden also led in a Quinnipiac survey released on Thursday, showing him up 51 percent to 44 percent over the president.

The RealClearPolitics polling average shows Biden leading Trump by 4.3 points.

Trump campaigned in the Keystone State on Monday, focusing on economic and energy issues.

The state was key to Trump’s unexpected victory four years ago when he narrowly won the state by roughly a point.

Trump’s campaign had spent time appealing to the white working class population in the state, which many said was widely ignored by the Democrats.

The latest battleground poll shows Trump leading with 51 percent of white voters, while Biden is close behind at 46 percent support from the voting bloc.

Penn noted Trump’s strong support among rural Pennsylvania voters, but acknowledged Biden’s strength in the suburbs.

“In Pennsylvania, Trump has strong rural support but is being pinned down by Biden in the suburbs, where the Democrat leads by a wide margin,” he said.

North Carolina

In North Carolina, Biden's lead is much narrower, as he leads Trump 49 percent to 48 percent. Three percent of respondents said they were not sure.

The results match up with other recent polling in the Tar Heel State. Biden leads by just 0.6 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.

The poll showed a stark racial divide in the state, with 60 percent of white voters saying they supported Trump and 38 percent supporting Biden. Ninety-one percent of Black voters said they supported Joe Biden and only 6 percent said the same for Trump.

“In North Carolina, Trump is getting little to no black vote and is down in the suburbs to make a should win state close,” Penn said.

Biden cruised to victory through the southeast in the Democratic primary earlier this year, thanks in large part to his galvanization of the Black vote in the region. Democrats are hoping that large turnout from the group will help Biden get the same results in November.

Biden also holds a 10 point lead over Trump among Latinos, 42 percent to 52 percent.

Trump’s tweets followed a handful of rulings by the Supreme Court in cases involving deadlines for mail-in ballots in the 2020 elections.

The Supreme Court handed two victories to Democrats in election-related legal disputes this week in allowing extended deadlines to remain in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, two critical swing states.

“If Sleepy Joe Biden is actually elected President, the 4 Justices (plus1) that helped make such a ridiculous win possible would be relegated to sitting on not only a heavily PACKED COURT, but probably a REVOLVING COURT as well,” Trump tweeted early Friday morning. “At least the many new Justices will be Radical Left!”

Trump in an earlier tweet also claimed that Biden would “destroy” the Supreme Court and warned: “Don’t let this happen!”

Biden has sidestepped questions about whether he would support adding to the number of justices on the Supreme Court, often referred to as court packing.

The former vice president said in a “60 Minutes” interview last week that he would convene a bipartisan commission to present recommendations to reform the court system, calling it “out of whack.”

Trump has consistently trailed Biden in national polling as Election Day approaches. Biden has also polled ahead in key battleground states.

The president has long railed against efforts to expand mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that doing so would invite massive fraud. Experts say there is no evidence of meaningful electoral fraud in mail-in voting.

Republicans received a victory in Minnesota on Thursday when a federal appeals court ruled that the state must keep late-arriving ballots separate in case they are ruled invalid.

Earlier this week, the president made clear he hoped the courts would rule in favor of Republicans and stop efforts to extend the deadline for receiving mail ballots beyond Election Day. Polls show that Democrats are more likely to use mail-in voting, while Republicans are more likely to vote in person.

“Hopefully the few states remaining that want to take a lot of time after Nov. 3 to count ballots, that won't be allowed by the various courts,” Trump told reporters Wednesday before the rulings in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Minnesota were handed down.

The rulings in Pennsylvania and North Carolina will allow ballots that are not postmarked after Election Day and that arrive three and nine days after Election Day, respectively, to be counted. In a separate ruling that represented a win for Republicans, the Supreme Court kept in place a Nov. 3 deadline in Wisconsin for the receipt of mail ballots.

In a tweet later Friday, Trump singled out the decision on mail ballots in North Carolina, labeling it ""CRAZY"" and insisting the election ""END"" on Nov. 3.

Biden leads Trump in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 52 to 42 percent.

Two weeks ago, the former vice president had an 11-point lead, 53 to 42 percent, NBC News reported.

Biden has a combined 6-point edge, 51 to 45 percent, in 12 battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the poll.

Biden currently holds an 82-point lead among Black voters in the poll, and is ahead of the president by 28 points among voters age 18 to 34, by 23 points among senior citizens, by 20 points among women, by 15 points among white voters with college degrees and independents.

Trump has a 21-point lead among white voters without college degrees and a 6-point edge among white voters.

A majority of those respondents who said they have already voted or plan to vote early sided with Biden while a majority of those who plan to cast their ballots on Election Day back the president, in findings consistent with other surveys.

Pollsters found that 45 percent of voters now approve of Trump’s job performance, while 52 percent disapprove. The gap was 10 points two weeks ago, with 44 percent approving and 54 percent disapproving.

Almost half of registered voters -- 48 percent – also said they would prefer that Democrats control Congress. Forty-three percent chose Republicans. The findings were virtually identical to a survey in August, NBC News noted.

Six in 10 respondents also said the country is heading in the wrong direction, while 31 percent said it is going in the right direction.

And a majority -- 55 percent -- said the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is yet to come. About a quarter said the worst of the pandemic is behind us and 15 percent said it's not a major problem.

The new survey of 1,000 registered voters, conducted Oct. 29 through Oct. 31, has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.

The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll aligns with several previous national polls showing Biden leading Trump nationally while maintaining a slight lead in battleground states.

Trump labels Fauci a 'disaster' on campaign call,"President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE derided Anthony Fauci Anthony FauciSenior adviser points to vaccine when pressed on Trump's comments about 'rounding the corner' on pandemic Davis: 5 questions for Trump voters Fauci rips White House coronavirus approach MORE as a “disaster” and claimed that Americans have tired of the novel coronavirus during a call with campaign staff on Monday.

“People are tired of COVID. Yup, there’s going to be spikes, there’s going to be no spikes, there’s going to be vaccines. With or without vaccines, people are tired of COVID,” Trump said on the private call, according to audio obtained by The Hill. “I have the biggest rallies I have ever had and we have COVID. People are saying whatever, just leave us alone. They’re tired of it.”

Trump then accused Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert, of providing inconsistent advice about the coronavirus pandemic and claimed baselessly that if he had followed all of Fauci’s advice the United States would have “700,000 to 800,000 deaths right now.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these people, these people that have gotten it wrong. Fauci is a nice guy, he’s been here for 500 years, he called every one of them wrong,” Trump told campaign staffers.

Trump zeroed in on how Fauci and other public health experts changed their position on mask usage early on in the pandemic when more concrete evidence emerged showing face coverings could blunt the asymptomatic spread of the virus. Trump also claimed that Fauci disagreed with his decision to restrict travel from China, despite the fact that Fauci has supported the president’s decision publicly.

“He’s like this wonderful guy, a wonderful sage telling us how he said, do not wear facemasks — that’s a number of months ago. He said, do not close it up to China. I have a list of 15 things,” Trump said. “And yet we keep him. Every time he goes on television there’s always a bomb. But there is a bigger bomb if you fire him. But Fauci is a disaster. I mean, this guy, if I listened to him, we would have 500,000 deaths.”

“Fauci, if we listened to him, we’d have 700,000 to 800,000 deaths right now. So, with that, I get along with him. If there’s a reporter on, you have it just the way I said it. I couldn’t care less,” the president continued.

Trump, who is in Nevada on a campaign swing out West, unloaded on Fauci during a call with about 2,000 staff Monday morning. A number of reporters listened in on the call.

ADVERTISEMENT

The president’s remarks Monday came after Fauci in an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” said he was not surprised Trump contracted the coronavirus after a White House event recognizing Trump’s Supreme Court nominee during which guests were not wearing masks or social distancing.

“I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded, no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask,” Fauci said in the “60 Minutes” interview on Sunday. “When I saw that on TV, I said, ‘Oh my goodness. Nothing good can come out of that, that's got to be a problem.’ And then sure enough, it turned out to be a superspreader event.”

A number of individuals who attended the event at the end of September later tested positive for the virus.

Trump has repeatedly spoken critically of Fauci in recent weeks, amid a remarkable public spat between the top health official and his campaign regarding the use of comments Fauci made during a March news interview in a campaign advertisement.

Fauci has insisted his statements were taken out of context and asked the campaign to take down the ad, but the campaign has declined to do so, saying his words are accurate and taken from a nationally broadcast television interview.

ADVERTISEMENT

“I do not and nor will I ever, publicly endorse any political candidate. And here I am, they're sticking me right in the middle of a campaign ad. Which I thought was outrageous,” Fauci said on “60 Minutes.”

Last week, Trump spoke dismissively about Fauci at a campaign rally in North Carolina, similarly suggesting he had offered inconsistent advice about the coronavirus and claiming that he is a Democrat. Trump also mocked Fauci on Twitter last week by invoking the wild first pitch he threw out at the Washington Nationals’ July season opener.

Still, Trump’s comments on Monday represented perhaps the most forceful critique he has levelled of the top health official to date. Hours after the conclusion of the private campaign, the president continued to attack Fauci on Twitter, remarking about the amount of ""airtime"" that Fauci receives and again mocking him for throwing ""perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball.""

The coronavirus, which has killed nearly 220,000 Americans and sent the U.S. economy into a freefall, has been a dominant issue during the 2020 election campaign.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE has put criticism of Trump’s response to the pandemic at the center of his presidential bid. Trump is currently trailing Biden in national and swing state polling, with roughly two weeks remaining before Election Day.

Trump, who himself was diagnosed with the coronavirus in early October, has painted a rosy picture of his administration’s response while mostly acting as if it is in the rearview mirror. He has said repeatedly that the U.S. is “rounding the turn” on the virus and has continued to hold large campaign rallies with crowds of supporters and limited mask wearing, even in states that are seeing cases spike.

Fauci has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 and is a member of the White House coronavirus task force. He has offered unvarnished and blunt public assessments about the coronavirus that have at times contradicted Trump’s own rosy pronouncements, and he has publicly criticized the president’s large campaign rallies during the pandemic.

Kushner, who is also the president's son-in-law, told Woodward on April 18 that the country was moving into what he deemed the ""comeback phase."" The comments came one day after Trump tweeted out support for people protesting against coronavirus-related restrictions with calls to ""liberate"" Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia.

""There were three phases. There’s the panic phase, the pain phase and then the comeback phase. I do believe that last night symbolized kind of the beginning of the comeback phase,"" Kushner told Woodward, according to an audio recording published by CNN.

""That doesn’t mean there’s not still a lot of pain and there won’t be pain for a while, but that basically was — we’ve now put out rules to get back to work,"" he continued. ""Trump’s now back in charge. It’s not the doctors. They’ve kind of — we have, like, a negotiated settlement.""

Kushner told Woodward that working out guidelines allowing parts of the economy to reopen ""was almost like Trump getting the country back from the doctors. Right? In the sense that what he now did was, you know, he’s going to own the open-up.""

The comments came in April, when the country had managed to reduce infection rates and improve hospital capacity after the administration promoted an initiative to ""slow the spread"" for 30 days by encouraging social distancing and mask wearing.

Trump told Woodward in February and March that he was aware the virus was dangerous and could spread through the air, but that he wanted to intentionally play down its severity to avoid causing panic, according to previously released recordings.

But in the six months since, Trump has agitated for the country to fully reopen, leading to a spike in virus cases.

The U.S. is in the midst of yet another surge in infections and hospitalizations. The country over the weekend saw a record high seven-day average of reported infections. The virus has killed at least 225,000 Americans, the most reported deaths of any country in the world.

The president still routinely complains about states that he says have been too slow to lift restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus, including at a rally on Tuesday in Michigan.

Kushner told Woodward in April that he believed it would be politically beneficial for Trump to ""own the opening"" of the country.

The lawyers also cited a billboard featuring Kushner, another senior White House adviser, next to body bags and an unrelated 2019 quote from before the pandemic in which he said New Yorkers would “suffer.”

“I am writing concerning the false, malicious and defamatory ads that the Lincoln Project is displaying on billboards in Times Square,” wrote attorney Marc Kasowitz. “If these billboards are not immediately removed, we will sue you for what will doubtless be enormous compensatory and punitive damages.”

The Lincoln Project as well as Democrats have launched withering criticism at the White House over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic as cases spike across the country. The group has risen to prominence by releasing rapid-fire ads highlighting the latest controversy stemming from the White House, often going viral online and drawing rebukes from the president.

The anti-Trump group has most recently begun teaming up with Democratic groups to roll out ad buys worth millions of dollars in key swing states to hit President Trump on an array of issues, including the current health crisis and its economic fallout.

The Lincoln Project maintained in a statement that it will leave the billboards up, saying they accurately depict a lax attitude toward the pandemic.

“The level of indignant outrage Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have shown towards The Lincoln Project for exposing their indifference for the more than 223,000 people who have lost their lives due to their reckless mismanagement of COVID-19 is comical. While we truly enjoy living rent free in their heads, their empty threats will not be taken any more seriously than we take Ivanka and Jared,” the group said in a statement.

McEnany appears on Fox in 'personal capacity' as Trump campaign adviser,"White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany appeared on two Fox networks on Tuesday as an adviser to the Trump campaign, further blurring the lines between the government and the president's reelection effort.

McEnany was identified on both ""America's Newsroom"" on Fox News and ""Varney & Co."" on Fox Business Network as a ""Trump 2020 campaign adviser."" She appeared to be recording the interviews from the Trump campaign's headquarters in Virginia, with Trump-Pence logos visible behind her.

White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews said McEnany ""was appearing in her personal capacity as a private citizen."" The distinction allows McEnany to avoid violating the Hatch Act, which forbids White House staffers from engaging in campaign activities.

She targeted the former vice president on Fox News over his stance on fracking and whether he supports expanding the Supreme Court.

""Joe Biden has become an empty vessel for the radical left as he’s withered away,"" McEnany said.

On Fox Business, she was introduced as an ""adviser to the Trump campaign."" She was pressed on why the campaign does not enforce mask wearing more strictly at rallies, particularly as coronavirus cases spike across much of the country.

“We have a First Amendment in this country, and President Trump is very intent on wanting to fight for the vote of the American people. Joe Biden’s in his basement,"" McEnany said. ""If he won’t fight for your vote, he certainly will not fight for you as president.""

McEnany previously served as the national press secretary for the Trump campaign until April when she was brought into the White House. In the six months since, McEnany has been a fierce defender of the president, giving semi-regular press briefings where she largely attacks the media and sticks to administration talking points.

The Trump White House has come under scrutiny repeatedly for blurring the lines between government activity and openly political activity.

But it would take a larger polling error for history to repeat itself in 2020.

Trump is defending an enormous number of battlegrounds and must run the board in states that look like toss-ups, including Ohio, Iowa, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida.

The FiveThirtyEight forecasting model gives Trump about a 10 percent chance of winning the White House, roughly equal to pulling an inside straight in poker. In 2016, the same model gave Trump nearly a 1 in 3 chance of winning.

Still, the race for the White House is within the margin of error in many of the battleground states that will determine the outcome. Trump has a real but small chance to win the Electoral College, if he can piece together the right combination of swing states.

A Biden landslide victory, in which he turns Texas and Georgia blue for the first time in decades, is also a possibility.

Here’s a look at where the race stands in the states that matter most, starting with those likeliest to stay in Trump’s column.

TEXAS

ADVERTISEMENT

Neither Biden nor Trump will have campaigned in Texas in the closing weeks, an indicator that both campaigns believe the historical GOP stronghold in the South leans toward Republicans.

Still, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report recently shifted Texas into the toss-up column and Democrats working to get Biden elected insist that it’s in play. Democrats believe they’ll benefit from a high turnout election, and more people have already voted in Texas than voted in all of 2016.

The polls are very close, with the RealClearPolitics average showing Trump ahead by 2.3 points and the FiveThirtyEight average showing him with a 1.3 point advantage.

Trump’s margins will matter. If he only wins narrowly, it could be a bloodbath for Republicans running in competitive House districts.

And with some polls showing Biden in the lead in Texas — most recently a Dallas Morning News survey found him ahead by 3 points — it would not be a total surprise to see the state go blue, which would deliver a landslide victory for Biden.

GEORGIA

In a development that would have been almost unthinkable at the beginning of the cycle, Biden has narrow leads over Trump in both the RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight averages of polls in Georgia.

The race is still very close — within 1.7 points in both averages — but it’s hard not to feel like Democrats have the momentum heading into Nov. 3. Biden has led in the FiveThirtyEight average for the entire month of October.

Biden campaigned in Georgia this week, giving a big speech in a rural part of the state, before campaigning in Atlanta. Trump will campaign in Georgia this weekend. The state has not gone for the Democratic nominee since 1992.

A Trump loss in 2020 would also hurt the GOP’s hopes of holding the Senate, as there are two competitive races there this cycle. A candidate must win 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff election.

OHIO

The longtime presidential bellwether broke for Trump by 8 points in 2016, leading many Democrats to write it off for 2020.

But Biden’s polling strength across the Rust Belt and Midwest has put the state won by the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and 2012 back in play.

The polls show Ohio is a pure toss-up, with RealClearPolitics showing the race is tied and FiveThirtyEight giving Trump a 1-point advantage.

ADVERTISEMENT

The only major poll of the state out this week is from Quinnipiac University, which found Biden ahead by 5 points. Quinnipiac has had a steady lean in Biden’s favor throughout the cycle.

We should know the results from Ohio relatively early on election night. If Biden wins, it’s all but over for Trump.

IOWA

Iowa is in the same category as Ohio. Trump won it by 9 points in 2016, but it’s unexpectedly competitive in 2020. Obama won it in 2008 and 2012.

Once again, the polling averages reflect a tossup, with Biden ahead by 1.2 points in the RealClearPolitics average and 0.3 points in the FiveThirtyEight average. Biden campaigned in Des Moines on Friday. Trump is headed to Iowa this weekend.

A Quinnipiac poll out this week found Trump ahead by 1 point.

Keep your eyes peeled for a potential Des Moines Register poll this weekend. That survey is known as the gold standard for Iowa. The poll nailed the 2016 race, which should have been a warning sign for Democrats about their weakness in the Midwest. The last Des Moines Register poll was from September and showed the candidates tied.

ADVERTISEMENT

NORTH CAROLINA

The polls show the candidates are separated by only a razor-thin margin in the Tar Heel State, with Biden ahead by 1.9 points in the FiveThirtyEight average and by less than 1 point in the RealClearPolitics average.

The Hill’s poll finds Biden with a 1-point lead, while The New York Times-Siena College put his lead at 3 points. A new NBC News-Marist poll put Biden’s advantage at 6 points — the largest lead he’s had in any poll of the state dating back to June.

North Carolina is another must-win for Trump and it could go either way.

FLORIDA

Do the polls matter in Florida? The last two elections have been decided by 1 point or less and it seems likely that the Sunshine State is headed for another photo finish in 2020.

Biden leads by 2 points in the FiveThirtyEight average and by 1.2 points in the RealClearPolitics average.

ADVERTISEMENT

Of the polls making up the RealClearPolitics average, Biden has led by 2 points or more in eight of the 11 polls released in the past two weeks.

Trump leads 3 points or more in the remaining three polls, which were conducted by Trafalgar Group, Susquehanna College and the conservative outlet Rasmussen. Those pollsters have been more favorable for Trump this cycle, reflecting a controversial narrative that so-called “shy” Trump voters are too embarrassed to tell pollsters they support the president.

The race here could turn on Biden’s support among Latinos. Some polls have found him running behind Clinton’s level of support in the state.

ARIZONA

There is a disparity in the polling averages in Arizona, with RealClearPolitics showing the race is a tie and FiveThirtyEight showing Biden with a 3-point advantage.

Polling has been sparse, and the RealClearPolitics average is tilted in Trump’s favor by two recent polls from Rasmussen and Susquehanna showing Trump in the lead.

Going back for the last month, Biden has led in 13 of the 16 major polls conducted, with only Rasmussen, Susquehanna and Trafalgar showing Trump in the lead.

Still, Biden’s lead is small. While it appeared for a while that Biden might be pulling away — he led by more than 5 points in the FiveThirtyEight average in mid-September — most recent polls show him with only a narrow advantage, giving hope to Trump.

The Phoenix-based pollsters OH Predictive Insights, who have been polling the state throughout the cycle, put Biden ahead by 3 points in their final survey. That’s within the poll’s 3.7 percentage point margin of error.

PENNSYLVANIA

Now we move out of the toss-ups into states where Biden has a clear — but not insurmountable — advantage.

Biden leads by 3.6 points in the RealClearPolitics average and by 5 points in the FiveThirtyEight model.

The Hill’s final poll of the state found Biden ahead by 5 points. Dating back to September, Biden has led in every major nonpartisan poll of the state except one released this week by Trafalgar, which found Trump ahead by 2 points.

Pennsylvania is widely viewed as the tipping point state for both campaigns in the race for 270 electoral votes. Biden will spend Monday blanketing the state and Trump will hold three rallies there on Saturday.

Trump won the state by fewer than 50,000 votes in 2016 and it appears to be the best shot he has at repeating a victory in one of the three former “blue wall” states.

While the president will be the underdog here on Election Day, it would not take a very big polling miss for him to pull it out once again.

WISCONSIN

Due to its large population of white working class voters, Democrats were pessimistic about their chances of winning Wisconsin back to start the cycle. Now, it appears to be moving back into their column.

Biden leads by 6.4 points in the RealClearPolitics average and by 8.6 points in the FiveThirtyEight average, his largest advantage of the cycle.

An ABC News-Washington Post released a poll this week showing Biden ahead by 17 points, although Democrats dismissed that survey as an outlier.

In-state pollsters at Marquette University and the University of Wisconsin have put the race in the 5- to 9-point range for Biden. Still, the Marquette poll that put Biden ahead by 5 points has a 4.4 percentage point margin of error. Democrats won’t rest easy until all the votes are counted.

MICHIGAN

Biden and former President Obama will campaign in Michigan this weekend, underscoring the importance of a state that Trump carried by about 11,000 votes in 2016.

The polls show Biden leading comfortably. He’s up by 6.5 points in the RealClearPolitics average and by 8.7 points in the FiveThirtyEight average.

Every recent poll going back to mid-October has found Biden leading by between 7 points and 11 points with the exception of Trafalgar, whose new poll found Trump ahead by 2 points.

MINNESOTA

There has not been much polling in Minnesota.

Biden leads by 4.7 points in the RealClearPolitics average and by 8.2 points in the FiveThirtyEight average.

The Biden campaign feels the race is close enough that it is sending him to campaign in the state in the final days before the election.

Trump came within 2 points of Clinton in 2016 despite not campaigning or spending in the state. He’s doing both this time around and there is clear energy for him in the rural parts of the state. The question is whether that will be enough to overcome Biden’s huge margins in the Twin Cities region.

NEVADA

Nevada is another state that Clinton won in 2016 where there is very little polling this time around.

FiveThirtyEight puts Biden’s advantage at 6 points and RealClearPolitics puts it at 4 points.

The latest New York Times-Siena College poll put Biden’s lead at 6 points, while the Las Vegas Review-Journal put him ahead by 2 points, well within the margin of error.

NEW HAMPSHIRE

Clinton won New Hampshire by fewer than 4,000 votes in 2016 but the state appears out of reach for Trump in 2020.

Biden leads by 11.4 points in the FiveThirtyEight average. He’s led by 8 points or more in every poll of the state this month.

Trump will hold five more rallies on Monday on the eve of Election Day. He will stop in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, along with two events in Michigan. His final event will be in Grand Rapids, Mich., the same city where he held his final rally of the 2016 campaign.

The president suggested to reporters on Friday that he may travel on Election Day on Nov. 3.

""I’ll give you that answer in the next couple of days,"" he said.

Trump is banking on large rallies to carry him across the finish line, hoping the sheer enthusiasm of his supporters will be able to overcome polls that show him trailing Biden in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina and narrowly leading or neck-and-neck with the Democratic nominee in Florida, Georgia and Iowa.

But the rallies may backfire in the middle of a pandemic, as his supporters sparsely wear face masks and cram in by the thousands even as the country sets records for daily infections. In addition, tens of millions of ballots have already been cast in this year's elections, leaving fewer undecided voters.

Biden has been less aggressive with his travel, visiting three states on Friday for the first time since capturing the nomination. The tentative schedule has worried some allies, but he is expected to be on the road in each of the final days of the race, visiting Michigan alongside former President Obama on Saturday and traveling to Pennsylvania on Sunday and Monday.",2020-10-30 13:10:14-04:00,

It remains to be seen whether the Trump campaign will abide by the 250 person limit set out by the state. Vice President Pence held an event in Hibbing, Minn., earlier in the week that drew close to 600 people, according to local reports.

Both Trump and Biden will be in Minnesota on Friday campaigning in a state that hasn't been carried by a Republican in decades. However, the Trump campaign views the state as a battleground in the election.

The candidates' approaches to campaigning in the middle of a pandemic have been markedly different.

Trump's rallies typically feature supporters packed closely together. Those directly behind the president who are in view of cameras wear masks throughout, but the vast majority of other attendees typically do not wear masks.

The president also speaks optimistically about the pandemic in a way that does not match the reality that cases, hospitalizations and deaths are all on the rise.

The Gaston County Department of Health and Human Services said the cases are not thought to be an indication of spread from the rally, but rather two independent cases among individuals who were in attendance.

One of the people infected was a local television reporter, who tweeted that he was wearing a mask the entire time ""but due to Secret Service protocols, there were several times when social distancing wasn't possible.""

Contact tracing is underway, and other places these individuals have been and other close contacts to these individuals are being notified directly by public health staff.

However, the county said it is making a broader announcement ""because of the large number of potential contacts from the rally, and the inability to alert them directly.""

Community members who attended can assess their own risk and take appropriate actions, and the county is encouraging them to monitor their symptoms and seek testing if needed.

While the rally was outdoors, which public health experts say helps reduce the spread of the virus, it still drew tens of thousands of people who were standing shoulder to shoulder, many of whom were not wearing masks.

The announcement comes as coronavirus cases across the U.S. have been spiking to record-high numbers. On Thursday, North Carolina hit a record high of 2,885 new coronavirus cases reported in a single day. The state's seven-day average is around 2,000 cases.

The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Without mentioning Trump by name, Gov. Roy Cooper (D) on Wednesday said he was concerned about large political rallies, and that people may not be comfortable talking to contact tracers about where they may have been exposed.

“I’m really concerned about campaigns that fly in all over the place and come into North Carolina, hold these large events, gathering a lot of people together, also bringing in people from out of state, and then leaving,” because North Carolina residents will be left to deal with the aftermath, Cooper said at a press conference.

“And we know two to three weeks later, oftentimes, you see spread that occurs, infections that occur,” Cooper said.

North Carolina prohibits gatherings of more than 50 people outdoors in venues that hold fewer than 10,000 people, and a cap of 7 percent capacity for venues that are larger.

President Trump is trailing Biden narrowly in Florida, North Carolina and other key swing states, according to recent polls. Part of his problem has been struggles with female voters.

Who is 'Anonymous' author Miles Taylor?,"A two-year Washington mystery finally ended Wednesday when Miles Taylor revealed that he had authored a previously anonymous op-ed published in 2018 declaring himself part of a secret “resistance” within the Trump administration.

The op-ed, which appeared in The New York Times, faced both praise from some of President Trump Donald John TrumpBiden leads Trump in survey of Texas voters from left-leaning pollster On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump rebukes FBI for investigating supporters accused of harassing Biden bus MORE’s critics as well as its own criticism over the author’s insistence of anonymity and the claims made within the piece.

Among other things, the op-ed claimed that a number of senior administration officials were actively working behind the scenes to thwart “Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.”

“[M]any of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations,” it continued.

The op-ed’s publication caused a furor in Washington, including denunciations from the White House and the president, who demanded on Twitter that the Times reveal Taylor’s identity.

Some Democrats at the time also criticized the op-ed’s author, with some arguing Taylor should have done more while others, including former President Obama, warned that the actions were “undemocratic.”

“Anonymous” would strike again in November 2019 with the publication of “A Warning,” which further claimed that Cabinet officials had discussed the potential of removing Trump from office via the 25th Amendment, which would allow the vice president and a majority of Cabinet members to declare the president unfit for office.

Vice President Pence and other senior administration officials denied at the time that those discussions had ever taken place, but the book’s claims about Trump’s decisionmaking further fueled speculation about the identity of “Anonymous.”

That speculation came to an end Wednesday when rumors began circulating that day that the identity of “Anonymous” would be announced, and hours later Taylor’s identity was revealed in tweets from the Times’s Ben Smith and CNN anchor Jake Tapper Jacob (Jake) Paul TapperBiden, Trump camps hopeful of victory ahead of Election Day DeWine forecasts Trump wins Ohio in 'close vote' Rick Scott says it's Trump rallygoers' 'responsibility' to decide whether to social distance and wear masks MORE.

Polling data and early voting totals give Democrats reason for optimism, though the legacy of the 2016 election Trump won still haunts the opposition party. Here are the five factors that have put Biden in position to win on Tuesday.

Voters like Biden

Four years ago, voters hated candidate Donald Trump, but they hated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOn The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday Trump winning farm vote despite pinch of trade policies, pandemic Trump stages five rallies in five states in pre-election sprint MORE just as much. Voters ultimately picked Trump, the outsider who promised to shake things up, rather than Clinton, the perceived insider who would continue business as usual.

Now Trump is the incumbent, and his favorable ratings have improved — polls conducted this week by Fox News and CNN both show his favorable ratings in the low 40s, compared with the mid-to-high 30s he registered just before Election Day 2016.

But Biden is seen far more favorably than Clinton — or Trump — ever has been. Both Fox News and CNN pegged Biden’s favorable rating at 55 percent, the result of what Biden insiders say has been a consistent strategy to keep those numbers high through positive advertising that is increasingly uncommon in modern politics.

Persuadable voters tend to ask two questions during a presidential campaign: Do they like the job the incumbent is doing, and if not, is the challenger an acceptable alternative? Biden has set himself up as the acceptable alternative to a deeply unpopular incumbent.

Billion-dollar Biden

It’s easy to spread a message — positive or negative — when a campaign has more money than it knows what to do with. And Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., son of a used car salesman who struggled to find work in blue collar Scranton, Pa., and Wilmington, Del., has become the first presidential candidate in American history to raise $1 billion through his campaign account.

Biden’s largesse has allowed him to play across a broader battlefield than any candidate in recent memory. In just the last week, Biden and his outside allies are spending at least $11 million in Pennsylvania, Florida and Michigan and more than $5 million in North Carolina, Arizona and Wisconsin.

He is outspending Trump by 2-to-1 margins in many battleground states, including even states no Democrat has won since former President Clinton.

In the last week of the campaign, Biden and his allies will have spent about $77 million — compared with just $40 million for the Trump team. Trump’s campaign has insisted it has invested early in a ground game that could make the difference, but right now, the airwaves are dominated by the conversation Biden wants to have.

The coronavirus is top of mind

The coronavirus pandemic, more than any other issue, has come to define Trump’s first term in office. And a third wave of cases is peaking at exactly the wrong time for his efforts to change the subject.

It is possible that the United States records more than 100,000 new cases on a single day for the first time just before Election Day.

Trump’s own infection marked a low ebb for the campaign, when Republican poll numbers flatlined across the board. But he may have done more damage when he tweeted, while at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, that Americans shouldn’t let the virus “dominate your life.”

Voters cannot help but consider the virus and its devastating impacts on every facet of American life. Grandparents have not seen their grandchildren in months. Parents juggle their careers against maddening Zoom distance learning for their children. Almost half of Americans say they or someone in their household has lost income because of the pandemic, according to a Census Bureau study.

A new study released Saturday by The COVID-19 Consortium for Understanding the Public’s Policy Preferences Across States, a joint project of Northeastern, Harvard, Rutgers and Northwestern, found voters in 49 of the 50 states say the pandemic is the most important issue facing America today. Only Alaska voters said something else — climate change — was top of mind.

Trump is right: America has turned the corner on the virus. It’s just the corner that leads up, not down.

Seniors are breaking for Biden

For the last two decades, Democrats have had a problem winning over seniors. Trump carried those over the age of 65 with 52 percent of the vote in 2016. Former President Obama never cracked 45 percent among those voters. Former President George W. Bush carried them twice, by 5 points in 2004 and 4 points in 2000.

Today, older voters are backing Biden. The Fox News poll put Biden’s lead among those over 65 at 10 points; CNN had him up 11, 55 percent to 44 percent. Just 42 percent of those over 65 approve of the job Trump is doing, CNN found.

Older voters say Biden would be better at handling the response to the coronavirus by a whopping 22-point margin in a Quinnipiac poll conducted earlier this month. They give Biden a 20-point edge when asked which candidate would better handle health care. And while a slim plurality of all voters say Trump would do a better job handling the economy, seniors think Biden would be best for the economy by a 51 percent to 44 percent margin.

Younger voters favor Democrats in droves, but they are a smaller share of the electorate. Republicans need to make up for that gap with older Americans. This year, for the first time in a generation, the GOP doesn’t enjoy a silver edge.

Trump can’t pick a message

At a rally on Thursday in Tampa, Fla., Trump offered a telling example of a recurring theme that has bedeviled strategists in his own party for the last four years: He has little interest in sticking to a positive message that would make the case for a second term.

ADVERTISEMENT

""They’re calling me up,"" he said of former presidential candidates who offer him advice. ""'Sir, you shouldn’t be speaking about Hunter [Biden]. You shouldn’t be saying bad things about Biden because nobody cares.' I disagree. Maybe that’s why I’m here and they’re not. But they say, 'Talk about your economic success. Talk about 33.1 percent [GDP growth in the last quarter], the greatest in history.' Now look, if I do, I mean, how many times can I say it? I’ll say it five or six times during the speech.""

""But you look at that, and you look at Tucker Carlson Tucker CarlsonOn The Trail: The five factors that make Joe Biden the favorite Hunter Biden questions are too important for the media to dismiss Cable news October ratings explode as Fox News hits historic highs MORE, what he did the other night. Great. Great,"" he continued. ""And followed up by Sean [Hannity] and followed up by Laura [Ingraham]. And the next day, nothing at all, right? Nothing. Nothing in The New York Times, the fake New York Times. Hey, how about Anonymous?""

Trump views politics as a head-to-head contest rather than a battle for hearts and minds. That view leads him to attack Hunter Biden instead of focusing on the economic comeback his advisers would prefer as a closing message.

Joe Biden’s closing message is much more straightforward. “Character is on the ballot, the character of the country, and this is our opportunity to leave the dark, angry politics of the last four years behind us,” Biden says in one of his final ads.

Biden’s main thesis has been consistent from the day he announced his candidacy until now. Trump’s changes by the minute.",2020-10-31 14:51:06-04:00,
Cable news October ratings explode as Fox News hits historic highs,"Cable news ratings exploded in October across Fox News, CNN and MSNBC as all three networks saw record numbers for the month, with Fox News having the highest-rated month in cable news history, according to Nielsen Media Research.

The month included a positive coronavirus test for the president, who was briefly hospitalized, and a fever pitch on the presidential campaign trail. The month also included a presidential debate, a vice presidential debate and multiple town hall events.

Fox News led the way with a whopping 4.9 million total viewers in prime time, the highest number in the history of cable news dating back 40 years. MSNBC was second with 2.7 million viewers, followed by CNN with 2.4 million.

The top five shows for the month included Fox's ""Tucker Carlson Tucker CarlsonOn The Trail: The five factors that make Joe Biden the favorite Hunter Biden questions are too important for the media to dismiss Cable news October ratings explode as Fox News hits historic highs MORE Tonight"" with an average of 5.3 million viewers, followed by ""Hannity"" with 5.2 million and ""The Five"" with 4.1 million despite airing before prime time in the 5 p.m. EDT slot.

All three of the major cable news networks also saw substantial growth when compared to the same month last year.

Fox News was up 83 percent year-over-year in total viewers and 139 percent in the key 25-54 demographic that advertisers covet most in prime time.

CNN saw a 98 percent increase in total viewers when compared to October 2019, and a 116 percent jump in the demographic, while MSNBC is up 38 percent in total viewers and 45 percent in the younger category.

Lawsuit claims census supervisors pressured workers to falsify data,"A lawsuit filed by advocacy groups and local governments on Tuesday alleges that census takers were pressured to falsify data so that the U.S. Census Bureau could claim it had reached 99.9% of households when the survey ended two weeks ago.

Some census supervisors pressured census workers to fill in as many questionnaires as possible, The Associated Press reported, with many resorting to guessing how many people lived in a home, falsely claiming that neighborhoods were too dangerous to visit or that people had refused to answer questions when workers went door-knocking, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit, filed in San Jose by the National Urban League, claims that this was done in order to end the census early and have the numbers processed while Trump is still in office. The AP notes that this would allow the Trump administration to exclude undocumented immigrants when congressional seats are portioned out, to enforce a presidential order.

The AP reported that federal courts in both New York and California have ruled the president’s order as unlawful and unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court allowed Trump to end the census early with administration officials arguing that the earlier end date was needed in order to meet the end-of-year deadline to report results to the White House. In light of the coronavirus pandemic this year, households were allowed to fill out the census online.

McEnany tears into Miles Taylor after he's revealed as 'Anonymous' NYT author,"White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany issued a scathing rebuke of Miles Taylor, the former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) staffer who said on Wednesday that he authored the anonymous New York Times op-ed that revealed a member of the Trump administration criticizing the president's character.

""This low-level, disgruntled former staffer is a liar and a coward who chose anonymity over action and leaking over leading,"" McEnany said in a statement to reporters. ""He was ineffective and incompetent during his time as DHS Chief of Staff.""

CNN's Cuomo asks Miles Taylor why network should 'keep you on the payroll' after lying about op-ed MORE, announced Wednesday that he penned the op-ed, titled, ""I am part of the resistance inside the Trump administration."" It was published under an anonymous byline in the newspaper in 2018.

ADVERTISEMENT

In the piece, Taylor described a chaotic White House and an unhinged commander in chief showing little regard for constitutional or political norms that posed a danger to the country and world.

""We do not owe the President our silence. We owe him and the American people the truth,"" Taylor wrote in a blog post shortly after his identity was revealed. ""Too often in times of crisis, I saw Donald Trump prove he is a man without character, and his personal defects have resulted in leadership failures so significant that they can be measured in lost American lives. I witnessed Trump’s inability to do his job over the course of two-and-a-half years. Everyone saw it, though most were hesitant to speak up for fear of reprisals.""

Since leaving his post at DHS, Taylor has taken a job as a CNN contributor and has appeared in political advertisements for the group Republican Voters Against Trump.

In late August, Taylor was asked directly by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper if he had written the op-ed, which he denied.

“I wear a mask for two things, Anderson: Halloween and pandemics. So, no,” he said at the time.

Taylor was also reportedly involved in DHS's family separation policy, in which images of migrant children in cages sparked bipartisan backlash.

McEnany also tore into The New York Times for running Taylor's piece and painting him as a senior member of the Trump administration, dubbing the former chief of staff as a ""low-ranking official.""

“What we saw, week in and week out, and for me, 2 1/2 years in that administration, was terrifying,” Taylor said in an ad from the group Republican Voters Against Trump. Taylor goes on to claim that when Department of Homeland Security (DHS) staffers attempted to discuss national security issues with Trump, “he wasn’t interested in those things. … To him, they weren’t priorities.”

Taylor asserts Trump sought to “exploit the Department of Homeland Security for his own political purposes and to fuel his own agenda,” claiming Trump attempted to cut off federal wildfire aid to California because Californians did not support him. He also hits Trump on immigration, claiming the president wanted to “go further” than the zero tolerance policy that led to child separations and “have a deliberate policy of ripping children away from their parents to show those parents that they shouldn’t come to the border in the first place.”

Trump, Taylor claims, frequently issued illegal orders to DHS and “didn’t want us to tell him it was illegal anymore because he knew that … he had ‘magical authorities.'”

""Given what I experienced in the administration, I have to support Joe Biden for president,"" Taylor adds.

Taylor published an op-ed in The Washington Post Monday condemning the president on similar grounds. The op-ed blasts Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, stating “in his cavalier disregard for the seriousness of the threat, Trump failed to make effective use of the federal crisis response system painstakingly built after 9/11. Years of DHS planning for a pandemic threat have been largely wasted.”

The group released the ad the same day several Republican figures are set to address the virtual Democratic National Convention. Scheduled speakers Monday evening include former Ohio Gov.

Gidley, who previously worked at the White House before joining the Trump campaign, responded by saying he didn’t write the document and that the president has not been saying the pandemic is over.

Camerota then pressed him on whether the White House document is erroneous because it uses the word “ending.”

“I’m not looking at the document. I don’t know what the document says or how it characterizes the word ‘ending,’ but I’m not going to quibble over semantics,” Gidley said. “The fact is, we’re moving in the right direction.”

'I Have No Friends' – Interviews with Lonely Young People,"Friendships and social interactions are a primary human need, and research shows that people between 16 and 25 have better mental health and cope better with stress when they have close friends. But the reality of life as a young person without friends isn’t often discussed, because it can be embarrassing to admit that you’re lonely.

While the pandemic has had a profound effect on people feeling alone and isolated, loneliness was a problem way before lockdown stymied our social lives. In 2018, The UK appointed its first ever Minister for Loneliness, while in 2019 27 percent of young Americans said they had no close friends.

VICE contacted Join Us – an organisation that facilitates meet-ups between young people who struggle with loneliness – which put us in touch with Miel, Emma and Olivia*, for a chat about what it’s like to be young and friendless, and whether it’s worth asking for help.

I’ve always had a hard time making friends. In primary school things were OK for a while. I went to school in a smaller town and it was easy to hang out with friends after class. But from the time I was eight, I went to a special school – I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS, a disorder on the autism spectrum. My new school was in a city 30 kilometres [18.5 miles] away. My classmates and I were similar, but I didn’t feel a real connection with any of them. I also stopped hanging out with people after class. Maybe because of my autism disorder, social skills aren’t easy for me. I also tried to make friends while playing sports, but I quickly figured out I don’t really like team sports and I’m not competitive enough to play, either.

No one talks about how hard it can be to make friends. I was embarrassed by it, especially in early puberty. The outward image you project is very important, and having no friends is so pathetic. For a long time, I felt invisible to people my own age. Last year, I turned 18 – I’d just changed schools, and invited a whole bunch of classmates to celebrate my birthday, but nobody came. That’s when I realised that if I didn’t do something, I’d be lonely for the rest of my life.

Now, we have a great time together, which has really boosted my self-confidence. This year, for the first time, I had fun friends I could invite to my birthday party. It was a world of difference from the year before.

After that party for my 18th birthday, I decided to get in touch with Join Us. I read in the paper that they introduce people to other people who suffer from loneliness. At first, it felt a bit intense to go to a meet-up, because I was embarrassed. But it turned out to be a very good decision. That very first night, I clicked with someone, and at some point a friend group began to take shape.

You often see people with huge friend groups on social media. Seeing that makes me jealous. I’ve often wondered whether I’m too old to make friends at this point. Sometimes it seems like everyone has already decided who they want to hang out with for the rest of their lives. I know that sounds dramatic.

Summer breaks were especially hard. I had all the time in the world to do the fun things I wanted to do, but I didn’t dare do them by myself. So I often ended up not doing anything. I also struggled during the times I wasn’t doing very well. When a family member passed away, for instance, I really wanted to talk to someone outside of my family about it.

When I hit puberty, I started to miss real friendships. I wanted to discover things, go out, hit the bars, have adventures. I felt a strong urge to expand my horizons, but I didn’t have anyone I could do that with.

I’ve never had many friends. In elementary school I had one female friend and we’d sometimes hang out after class. At the time, I wasn’t bothered by it, because I didn’t know better. But I started having a really hard time when I got to high school.

When I was a teenager I began noticing that boys started wanting to hang out with me. I was so starved for company, it put me in a vulnerable position. At one point, I was sexually assaulted by a boy I met up with. I became suicidal and was sent to [Dutch mental health association] GGZ. There, I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression. They allowed me to go through recovery at home, under strict supervision. I could still go to school, but my every move was monitored. I couldn’t do anything alone anymore.

For a long time, I was sad that I didn’t have friends. I was mad at myself for years, and I felt so stupid. I didn’t understand why everyone was able to make friends, but not me.

I’d always invite more than ten people to my birthday party, but I’d be lucky if three of them showed up. Big holidays like New Year’s Eve were especially hard for me. I remember tagging along to [the parties of] my parents’ friends who had kids my age, but they’d made it very clear before I got there that I wasn’t allowed to sit at their table.

I was already suffering from low self esteem after being bullied in elementary school. The bullying stopped when I got to high school, but I still didn’t manage to make friends. I switched schools a few times, and every time I tried very hard to meet new people. At first, I often thought it was going pretty well, but then there would be a class party and my name would be one of the few that wasn’t on the invite list. I’d also ask people I felt a connection with if they wanted to do something after school – but it didn’t seem like anybody wanted to or had time. After a while I started to feel embarrassed, so I stopped trying. I didn’t want to seem pushy, either.

I finished up at GGZ a few months ago. I’ve learned so much about myself. It’s clear now that my self esteem needs to improve. I decided to get in touch with Join Us, and that’s helped a lot. They’ve challenged me to bring out the best in myself, but I’ve also learned that you don’t have to hold onto friendships that take more energy than they provide. That can be tough, especially if you don’t have many friendships, but it’s very important.

Olivia*, 25

I’ve always been a very social person. I had plenty of friends in high school and there was always someone around to spend time with. But after I finished school, all of that changed.

I get overstimulated very quickly and easily run out of energy. My high school friendships seemed to happen naturally, but they crumbled once I graduated and stopped seeing those friends on a daily basis. Suddenly, I had to put in a lot more effort to create connections with other people.

To this day, those connections haven’t happened – at least not in the Netherlands. I often go to Aruba for holidays, and I’ve made friends there. We’re so close, they’re almost like family. Maybe it’s easier because I’m more relaxed there. Getting to know people in the Netherlands can be very emotionally draining for me. Keeping up a budding friendship takes a lot of energy, and because I don’t have a lot, I just leave it be.

Often I’ll feel like going for a walk with someone, or going for a drink in town, but I don’t really know who I can go with. So come Friday night, I open a bottle of wine by myself and try to have a good time alone. Weekends can be tough, because you have so much time to do fun things, but for me there is nobody to do them with. I’m so baffled at times: I’m a social person and I want to, so why can’t I?

In summer, I see so many pictures on Instagram of friend groups going to festivals or out for drinks. It looks like a lot of fun and it makes me jealous. In those moments, I have to remind myself that social media isn’t real life. Thankfully, due to the pandemic, there were hardly any festival pictures this year.

Quarantine has made it even harder to see people. Because I’m very careful, I haven’t met up with anyone for months. A few months ago, I thought, ‘If I don’t see anyone soon, I won’t make it through this.’ That’s when I reached out to Join Us.

So far, I’ve only met people through the organisation on Zoom calls, but it’s really helped keep me going. I’ve also learned that being lonely is nothing to be ashamed of. For a long time, I thought something was wrong with me, but meeting other young people who suffer from loneliness has helped me realise that there are so many fun, nice and sociable people who have the same issue as me.",,
Half of House of Lords Peers Have Not Attended Anti-Bullying Training,"Nearly half of all peers in the House of Lords haven’t attended or booked to attend anti-bullying and anti-harassment training, according to Freedom of Information data obtained by VICE News.

Analysis of this data reveals that 388 of 798 sitting members of the upper chamber (49 percent) – including bishops, earls, life peers and former MPs – are yet to sit the free training as of September this year.

Those most likely to have already attended or booked to attend include Liberal Democrat and women peers, with 19 percent of the former and 28 percent of the latter still due to attend the Valuing Everyone training sessions.

Male peers, bishops and DUP peers are the worst for non-attendance, with 56 percent of men, 60 percent of bishops and all five DUP peers failing to attend the training. Forty-seven percent of all hereditary peers also did not make it to a session.

In August, VICE News found that 140 MPs hadn’t attended the same training before the start of summer recess, with Conservatives making up almost 90 percent of absentees. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 15 Cabinet members and a slew of Tory MPs have since signed up to the training.

As for their peers in the upper chamber, former Conservative Party leader William Hague, ex-deputy Labour leader John Prescott, former cabinet minister for Labour Peter Mandelson and Theresa May’s former housing minister and chief of staff Gavin Barwell are among those who did not attend the Lords’ Valuing Everyone session by the end of September.

The same can be said for Jenny Tonge, who quit the Lib Dems after she was suspended from the party following allegations of antisemitism; David Willetts, who was Education and Skills minister during the Coalition; and Baroness Warsi, who’s made consistent efforts to hold the Conservative Party to account for its alleged Islamophobia.

Advertising guru Maurice Saatchi also failed to sign up or attend the session by the end of the month, along with Professor Robert Winston, the doctor, scientist and TV presenter. Entrepreneur turned Apprentice star Alan Sugar – who has been accused of sending sexist and racist tweets – is also on the list of non-attendees. Sugar has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

VICE News contacted each of the peers named above for comment, but did not receive any responses.

Perhaps the presumption is that the esteemed individuals who make up the House of Lords – selected by virtue of their success, bloodline, proximity to a former prime minister or rank in the Church of England – might not need to take a course in how to not bully people, and how best to call out such harassment when it does occur.

Unfortunately, this doesn’t quite align with reality. One out of five staffers in the House of Lords say they have been harassed or bullied, according to an official 2019 report – but many failed to report this due to a fear of reprisal. In 2019 it was reported that, over the last six years, 11 peers have been sanctioned after harassment and bullying allegations.

More recently, Lord Stone, 78, was suspended by Labour and sanctioned by the Lords following allegations that he had sexually harassed staff members, including unwanted sexual touching and joking that he hoped the briefing document relating to the Upskirting Bill contained photos. His suspension was extended this summer and he was sanctioned again after more allegations – including unwanted sexual touching – were made against him by two young women. Stone is undergoing “bespoke training and behaviour coaching sessions” and still sits in the Lords.

Also on the Labour benches was Lord Lea, 83, who has been the subject of almost 20 staff complaints over the past decade, including two women alleging “stalkerish” behaviour. He was suspended from the party in January of this year. He has apologised for his actions but still sits in the Lords.

Then there’s Lord Feldman, who in 2015 was under pressure to quit his role as co-chairman of the Conservative Party following the suicide of Elliott Johnson, an activist who took his own life aged 21 after alleging bullying in the party when Lord Feldman was in charge of CCHQ. Lord Feldman did not resign and continues to sit in the Lords. In the summer of 2020, the party released a summary of its inquiry into the alleged bullying, denying any responsibility and promising a clear complaints procedure for volunteers.

The House of Lords told VICE News that peers may not have been able to attend the training due to the summer recess, the prorogation of Parliament in 2019 and its dissolution ahead of the last election. The coronavirus pandemic also made training temporarily unavailable before it was moved online.

They added: “Since the Valuing Everyone training was offered to members of the Lords in September 2019, more than 390 have voluntarily completed it. This is good progress […] Earlier this week, the Lords Conduct Committee published a report recommending changes to the Code of Conduct which will require all members to do this training.”

However, the training has been available since 2018. Here’s a guide to the 388 peers who hadn’t turned up or booked to attend the training before the end of September.

Predictions for 2020 Christmas Adverts,"I don’t know about you but the prospect of Christmas during a pandemic does not exactly thrill me. My own possible scenarios are thus:

I remain in what will be by then Tier 3 London and spend the day on various glitchy FaceTime calls to my family in Tier 3 Birmingham, as I get steadily drunker on the Bucks Fizz I started on at 9AM. I go home due to an eleventh hour national broadcast by Boris Johnson, naturally dressed as Father Christmas, announcing that all the rules are off for three days, prompting the papers to proclaim he has “sleigh-ed the virus,” and a spike in coronavirus-related deaths two weeks later. I am too nervous to actually go near any of my family members, so I spend the day eating roast potatoes and a selection box, sitting at a makeshift table in the garden, wearing a gorgeously festive puffa jacket.

Whichever way it goes (and I’m sure the prospects I’ve outlined there are certainly not as strange or sad as it’ll get for some), Christmas is going to be weird this year – but as the heartwarming old saying goes, Capitalism Finds a Way. As the single most important economic period of the year, both the government and the shops are going to be doing everything they can to make sure we’re still spending, despite the fact that so many have lost jobs and livelihoods this year. And their grand apparatus in this mission? Christmas adverts.

The “Christmas advert” is a strange mutation of The Idea of Christmas (you know: family, friendship, golden roast turkey and so on, ignoring the fact that the reality is more like: arguing, seeing who dies on Eastenders, and overdone pigs in blankets) and our shopping-obsessed culture, that for some reason British society has come to regard with a special significance and reverence. Since the department store John Lewis – whose festive TV spots have come to be lauded to such a deranged degree that they “premiere” during ITV programmes with especially high viewership –started at it in 2007, almost every large chain and supermarket has followed suit.

Essentially, the Christmas adverts compete with each other to be the most heartwarming, in order to remind you to buy stuff from them. This year, with Christmas being so unusual and up in the air, however, you do have to wonder what they’ll come out with. I have some thoughts, therefore, about what I’d imagine we can expect from this year’s John Lewis ad: please join me on this depressing thought experiment, where there’ll be absolutely loads of footage of an old person speaking into an iPad.

Reference to COVID within the first five seconds

There’s no way they can get around not talking about it, considering that the advert is going to have to be about it. And there I was, hoping for a bit of escapism from my festive advertising!

The sad character is an old person

There is always a sad character in John Lewis adverts, because they are adverts, not major motion pictures, so there has to be someone sad in order to quickly build the empathy required for the emotional response they’re after. This year they’ll be hitting the heartstrings especially hard, and who tugs at them more than the Old, particularly in a year which they spent a significant chunk of shielding from the rest of the population? I will say here that this is not to underplay or be in any way cynical about the plight of the elderly this year – which has been genuinely awful, thanks to a total lack of care and provision from the government – and more to point out that advertising frequently plays on our deepest sympathies in order to get us to think it understands us on a human level, when in fact it only understands us as economic actors. Just Fun Little Thoughts…x

Old person looking forlornly at an iPad

Bonus points if it’s shot through a window.

A child talking to an old person via an iPad

The child will be shot in a warm glow in a family home. There will be ambient noise where you can hear the mum going “Say hello to grandma” while she clatters fish fingers around in the kitchen, over the music. The grandma’s house by contrast will be silent and lit by the television only, to signal that she is miserable.

Actually loads of in-home technology

Considering that in-home tech has been one of the year’s big trends – Zoom, that weird Facebook frame, VR headsets, the proliferation of Ring and Alexa – paired with the fact that it doesn’t look like Miss Rona will be taking her leave anytime soon, I think that the advert will lean heavily on its powers: relatable and sales conscious!

Live-action

Last year’s John Lewis Christmas extravaganza was an animated short featuring a dragon who breathed too much fire (which if you ask me is slightly too reminiscent of the cinematic masterpiece Happy Feet), but for 2020 I’m pretty sure they’ll go for realism to really lay on the “DOESN’T THIS REMIND YOU OF YOUR NAN??? DOESN’T IT???” response.

“Hello” by Adele sung by a children’s choir

Can’t you just imagine this? The starring old person (played by Captain Tom Moore) is settling in for a lonely night when lo! A (socially distanced) choir of kids with tinsel round their heads and Adele in their hearts, lead by their grandchild, arrives outside their house just in time for the “HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIDE” bit. Absolutely risible stuff that I’m getting annoyed about despite the fact that it hasn’t even happened (yet)!

Old person unwrapping an Alexa

Alright maybe that’s a bit on the nose.

Despite the fact that as you watch it you are well aware that you’re being manipulated emotionally by a corporation to get you to buy your dad a set of cheese knives from them and not one of their competitors, the advert will make you cry, because this year has ground you to a husk.",,
'I Wanted to Stand Out' – A Candid Chat with Christine Quinn,"Christine’s team told her we’d do the interview at half-midnight her time, 7.30AM UK time, and her laptop is surrounded by what must be high-end ring lights on a “sunrise glow” setting. I’m hunched over my screen and she’s perched a few feet back from hers, displaying pelvis-length extensions, a full face of highlighter and a Louis Vuitton T-shirt.

There’s a wink-wink element to her persona, no doubt based on the fact she was an actress prior to the show and knows all too well how to work an audience into squeamish delight with a withering comment or a death stare. When I tweeted months ago that Christine was planted to be the devil and her colleague Chrishell cast as her foil, the angel, she replied with a heart eyes memoji and followed me back. I asked her if I was correct. She replied with a tinkling laugh: “I love that, so funny, no wonder I liked it…”

Christine is the power bitch who hires a zebra for her own engagement party; the realtor who lures the prestige babes and gays of LA to an open house with mini burgers and botox; the bride who wears a black wedding dress and suffocates guests with fake snow as she walks down the aisle (“they were being so dramatic ”); the woman whose only regret from filming the show was that she didn’t push “the envelope a little more”.

The glossy reality show had one immediate breakout star. Not the tiny bronzed twins who own the Oppenheim Group real estate agency, nor the hilariously French toy-boy Romain , who simply cannot be arsed with any of the drama, but Christine Quinn , top house seller, destroyer of men and any HR department’s worst nightmare.

This is a reality star who “came up” while everyone else was locked down. After the pandemic hit, for the first time in a long time, everyone everywhere seemed to be consuming the same culture: we all watched Tiger King and considered going to Zoom club nights. Then, when season two of Selling Sunset premiered on Netflix in May, we all became transcendentally aroused by Hollywood Hills mansions. By the time season three dropped in August, Selling Sunset was a household name.

Well, now you have an extravagant existence, and your glam life is central to why the public loves you. What were your adolescence like? It wasn’t extravagant, that’s for sure. My mum was a homemaker and my dad is an engineer. We’re from a very different part of town. I went to school and I did theatre. I was… not nerdy, but I guess I was a theatre nerd. Yeah, maybe I was [laughs]. I feel like I’m still performing, so maybe I’m not that different.

VICE: Did you watch Cribs as a teen? Christine Quinn: I was huge into MTV and I grew up watching the show on TV, same as you. The town that I lived in, people rode their horse to the grocery store, so to me it was just the most extravagant show ever. When I heard that they were doing a reboot, I was so excited. I can’t believe I get to be a part of it.

We’re speaking because she has an episode on the new reboot of MTV Cribs, and throughout the interview the real Christine is on display. She’s polite and sweet, with a hint of Southern belle charm, and occasionally slips into the odd wry Christine-ism.

I’ll never forget your teary breakdown on Selling Sunset when you spoke about getting bullied. How do you decide, with unscripted reality shows, which parts of yourself you want to offer up and what you want to hold back?

It’s really a matter of when we’re filming what feels comfortable at the time. There are some things that are mine that we want to talk about, but it doesn’t necessarily come up in the scene or it’s not right for the scene. But I do my best to be pretty authentic and bring my own element into everything that we do. Sometimes you do have to be careful, because the girls love to gossip and they do love fights. You’ve got to pick and choose.

I can’t remember the last time a reality star was so instantly beloved by prestige media – you’ve been interviewed by Vogue, you’re on the latest Harper’s Bazaar cover – in addition to the tabloids and celeb press. Is there a reality star whose career you’ve tried to emulate?

I think Paris Hilton was a great example of someone who came from reality television – and forget she’s stunning and gorgeous and a supermodel, I’m not saying I am – but I kind of did that route as well. And Cardi B, she started in reality shows, and now she’s a rapper and she’s on the cover of ELLE and it’s pretty incredible. I feel like, because Selling Sunset is global, the reach is different, and I’m really happy to be even in that category.

Do you like any of our British reality stars?

Gemma Collins. She’s brilliant. I know her from her show, I’ve seen lots of clips on social media. I didn’t know who she was until a few years ago, and then I kinda fell in love. First of all, I think she’s beautiful. She’s funny and she’s blonde and witty and bold. She says what’s on her mind, so I automatically gravitated towards her – I think she’s really special.",,
The Last Good Summer,"In the fall of 2015, Carole Radziwill, author, former reality television star, and owner of a famous couch , sat down to a televised lunch with her then-friend and coworker Bethenny Frankel. The two were filming a scene that would air during Episode 2 of Season 8 of the Real Housewives of New York a year later, and the issue du jour was Radziwill's relationship with her boyfriend, Adam Kenworthy, who is almost a quarter of a century younger than her.

""The five summers plan does not mean I will be dead in five years,"" Radziwill explained in an interview producers cut to immediately after her shocking statement. ""It simply means that I am very aware of the fact that in five years I might be in a very different place in my life. So I am very careful about my use of time, much more careful than I was even in my 40s.""

I only have like five good summers left. The words spewed out of television sets across the world, astounding Bravo-watchers everywhere. If Radziwill, a successful, beautiful woman-about-town only had a few good summers left—so few she could specify and count them on one hand—where did that leave the rest of us?

""He wants kids. He wants different things in life, and he should have them, and I hope he gets everything he wants,"" Radziwill replied. ""We do love each other. I told him, I only have like five good summers left. He has like 20.""

""How is it going with Adam?"" Frankel asked Radziwill, who was in her early 50s at the time, before probing further: ""Could you be with him for ten years? Could that happen?""

If Radziwill truly was so systematic in her approach to assessing and using her time, she was doing something we have all been forced to think about a lot lately. For the young and the privileged, the idea of Just five good summers is unfathomable, a concept to regard with shock and awe, sympathy and fear. But there is nothing horrifying about trying to create a set of rules, of guidelines for yourself, the way Radziwill was doing. It’s a way to understand and frame your choices, your life, your future—and it’s something we all do with regularity in all aspects of our lives, and with new, constantly shifting urgency right now, given how messy and unsystematized the world has become.

The words struck me too—what a strange, idiotic coincidence, the kind of anniversary you either actively look for while trying to make sense of your life, or stumble across with glee. A summer that for the majority of people on Earth was in many ways like no summer they had ever had before, and not one they would want to repeat again, would be Carole's last good one.

I'd put it out of mind myself, but this year, it came back around, taking on new meaning, when fans of the franchise began to realize that the summer of 2020, in all its inescapable misery, was, according to her original timeline, Carole's actual last good summer. ""Just made the realization that this is Caroles last good summer. Wow. Really goin out with a bang,"" Samantha Bush, who runs the Instagram account @BravoHistorian, wrote in May.

Though she's been off the show for a few years now, the “five good summers left” concept has not left the ether; take, for instance, the dozens of t-shirts available for purchase emblazoned with variations on the phrase, including one from the Real Housewives podcast Bitch Sesh that reads "" Carole's Last Great Summer ,"" the words spelled out in a 70s-esque font above a leaping dolphin.

We spend a fair amount of time trying to outsource these rules to other people, and, increasingly, to things, to make our lives easier, but mostly, to make our own choices simpler. If you have only five good summers left, then you know what you have to do—either find more time, or make that time count. Using systems and data to do the latter has become the norm.

This issue of VICE magazine, the third of our year and a collaboration with Motherboard, our tech desk, concerns just that kind of systematic approach: algorithms. An algorithm is, at its core, a set of rules, created by a human, or many humans, to provide stasis and ease. To put a difficult decision or complex function into the mechanisms of a system, one that is all-knowing, logical, and fixable, seems strategic and smart.

But humans make those systems, and they funnel the data into those algorithms, and so nothing is truly untouched by our presence. Along with the logic we’re craving might come groupthink, or homogenization, bias—and unfortunate mishaps, intended or otherwise. In tandem with that mapped-out five-year plan might come a global pandemic, uprisings, resistance to the status quo. That's some of what we tried to explore in this issue—our never-ending presence in our own creations, our inability to get out of our own way, as much as we might attempt to.

I reached out to Radziwill to see if she wanted to talk about the dark irony and accidental prescience of her catchphrase a couple of months ago; she did not get back to me, though her website's auto response very kindly said, ""Thank you! Love, CR."" She appears, if social media, that carefully controlled beast, is anything to be counted on, to have laid relatively low over the past few months, occasionally speaking out about the necessity of mask-wearing and the pressing need for our country to address its deep-seated civil rights issues. Her on-again, off-again relationship with Kenworthy seems still on, in some capacity, five summers later—they were recently spotted hanging out at former cast member Dorinda Medley’s Berkshires home. ""Venturing out of NYC for the first time since quarantine never felt so good. Sunshine, country air, and these two fresh water pearls……"" Radziwill captioned a photo of her in the pool in July with Medley and Medley's daughter, apparently taken by Kenworthy. She’s enjoying her “last good summer,” it seems, but surely not in the way she had planned. Rules may not be intended to be broken, but sometimes they end up that way anyway.",,
'You Couldn’t Swipe Fast Enough': How the Pandemic Devastated Instacart Workers,"With the $1,000 she earned each week shuttling groceries from supermarkets to her clients, she could make payments on her $2,300 a month mortgage, and car and utility bills, with enough left over to order novels from Amazon and household gadgets from QVC.

In 2019, Lisa, a single mother, lost her job as the media relations director at a firm in Nashville, Tennessee, moved south to her hometown Jacksonville, Florida, and signed up to deliver groceries for Instacart.

This article appears in VICE Magazine's Algorithms issue , which investigates the rules that govern our society, and what happens when they're broken.

In late April, the San Francisco-based start-up announced it had hired 300,000 new gig workers to meet rising demand for grocery delivery during the first two months of the pandemic, and had plans to bring on an additional 200,000 workers. The hiring boom in on-demand grocery delivery across the country wasn't limited to Instacart. The Target-owned delivery platform, Shipt, hired tens of thousands of shoppers during the pandemic. As of early August, the delivery service Amazon Flex was actively recruiting in 17 cities . Almost overnight, hundreds of thousands of laid off or underemployed Americans had transformed into grocery delivery gig workers.

“I had to be refreshing my phone all the time, sometimes waiting for three hours that I wasn’t getting paid [for], before I got a good order,” she told Motherboard. “You have to be attached to your phone. I couldn’t do anything else.”

The pandemic had prompted more households than ever before to sign up for Instacart’s grocery delivery service, making it profitable for the first time since its founding in 2012, but Lisa—a pseudonym, so she could speak candidly about her working conditions—was barely scraping by, and had picked up a second part time job at a local Publix grocery store to make ends meet.

The arrival of COVID-19 pandemic in Florida changed all of that. In May, Lisa’s weekly earnings hurtled downward from $1000 to $500 to $90 (recovering partially in June and July). She spent her days glued to her phone, refreshing the Instacart app for hours. Each time a new batch, or set of delivery orders, would flash on her phone screen, someone else in her area would snatch them up in a matter of seconds, often before she had time to react.

""To further support this community, our team has introduced new recognition programs, product features, shopper perks, and resources to enhance the shopper experience,"" they continued. ""We’ll continue to invest in this important community as we focus on delivering the best possible experience for all shoppers across North America.”

A spokesperson for Instacart told Motherboard that shopper earnings have actually increased from their pre-pandemic levels, based on customer and shopper marketplace data. ""In the wake of COVID-19, shopper earnings have increased by as much as 60% and shopper NPS - a measure of shopper happiness and overall sentiment - is at the highest level in company history,"" the spokesperson said.

But the demand for groceries didn’t keep pace with the number of Americans flocking to grocery and food delivery apps for available work, and workers found themselves competing against each other while refreshing their phones into oblivion. If heartwarming stories of mutual aid , where communities have banded together to care for, shelter, and feed one another during the pandemic have shown the power of solidarity in the absence of a strong social safety net, then the hundreds of thousands of desperate Americans gravitating towards gig work, and competing under and against a regularly shifting algorithm for an elusive supply of grocery delivery orders, paint a less inspiring picture.

“When coronavirus got bad here in May, third-party bots popped up. We ran into them at stores. You could tell who they were because they didn’t know the layout of the stores. One guy bragged about it to me in an Aldi grocery store. He was a bot,” Lisa said. (Shoppers often refer to other shoppers who pay for automated tools as “bots.”)

At the same time, in Instacart forums on Facebook, rumors circulated widely that the decline of work was primarily linked to the rise of third-party bots which snatched up orders quicker than a human could, and sold them to shoppers willing to pay a high price to game the system.

Adding to her difficulties, in March, Instacart had suspended its algorithmic ranking system, which rewards gig workers with the highest customer ratings by offering them the most lucrative orders first. The company explained in an announcement that, due to the “national state of emergency, all ratings below 5 stars” would be “forgiven.” (As of July, Instacart had reinstated the ranking system.) For veteran Instacart workers like Lisa, who had worked hard to achieve near-perfect ratings over hundreds of orders, this meant drastically lower earnings. As another Instacart shopper explained to me, the difference between a perfect 5 star average rating and a 4.97 star average rating can mean everything for access to the most lucrative orders under normal circumstances.

In early 2020, Lisa ranked near the top of 390 Instacart shoppers in the Jacksonville Beaches metro area, a sprawling island community to the north of Florida’s largest city. But during the pandemic, she says the app had hired an additional 900 shoppers in her area.

Veteran Instacart shoppers have noted that the pandemic is not the first time they’ve dealt with saturated markets and times when it’s difficult to get orders. Most years, usually in the fall, for reasons not entirely clear, orders slow down, competition rises, and Instacart slashes pay, prompting some contingent of shoppers to quit working on the app.

Instacart has claimed that the bots violate the companies’ trademarks and terms of service, and sent cease-and-desist letters to third-parties . In late July, Instacart sent out an email informing shoppers that it has partnered with a security platform “to develop a bot bounty program, specifically built to combat bots on the Instacart platform,” and promised to deactivate any shoppers who used third-party apps.

“Bot services have existed for Instacart for nearly two years, but bots have never been nearly as popular or common as many shoppers believe they are,” Heidi Carrico, an Instacart shopper and organizer with Gig Workers Collective, said. “The true problem is that Instacart hired 500,000 new Shoppers, while demand and order volume has declined from its peak at the beginning of the pandemic, creating a dynamic of fierce competition for orders.”

Multiple opportunists had developed bots that gave gig workers who paid, in some cases, thousands of dollars, the advantage of being able to scoop up orders faster than those who didn’t. But skeptical Instacart shoppers say the bots were mostly scams, the rumors were racist, and bots were not responsible for a significant portion of competition for orders—Instacart’s massive hiring spree was.

Some of the rumors were blatantly racist, accusing undocumented shoppers of using the bots to game the system. Motherboard viewed posts on Instacart Facebook groups that linked the bots to rings of non-English-speaking, Latinx immigrants who shopped in large groups.

“Things have started to get better,” Lisa told Motherboard in July. “It’s a combo effect. The bots are being handled and slowly but surely the oversaturation is starting to come down. All of these people who signed up to delivery groceries thought it was easy. Now we’re back to our rating system and that’s how we get batches.”

Though gig workers that Motherboard spoke to said their earnings recovered partially in June and July, suggesting that some of the new hires quit working on Instacart once restaurants and retail stores reopened, longtime workers say the number of shoppers are still above pre-pandemic levels and wages remain down.

Bill, an Instacart shopper in Houston, originally started working on the app nearly two years ago to supplement his income (he previously owned a food truck), and was finding it hard to quit gig work, until the pandemic hit and helped him with the decision.

“I was making $700 to $800 a week, then things just went bonkers. The orders were coming in so fast, you couldn’t swipe fast enough. I don’t know how a human can react that fast. Suddenly I was making $60 a week,” Bill said. “I was a mess. It used to be like anything else: ‘Doing this sucks but I know I can get batches, and I know I can make at least $500.’ All of the sudden it just disappears. Your income just goes. It’s very stressful.”",,
The Way to Prevent a Recount Disaster Is Sitting Right in Front of Us,"On the night of November 9, 2018, three days after the midterm elections, a group of protesters gathered outside the Supervisor of Elections office in Broward, Florida’s second-largest county and one of its most Democratic-leaning. The night before, a video had been posted to Twitter allegedly showing ballots being transported in private cars, and each time a truck pulled into the parking bay attached to the SOE’s office, the crowd took it as further proof that the election was being stolen.

This article appears in VICE Magazine's Algorithms issue , which investigates the rules that govern our society, and what happens when they're broken.

As the week wore on, the situation in Florida went from bad to worse. During the two weeks from Election Day until when the vote was certified, rejected ballots were confused with accepted ones, vote-counting machines malfunctioned, and at least six federal lawsuits were filed, with one county missing the state-mandated recount deadline altogether.

The only problem was that the recount hadn’t even begun. Broward was still receiving overseas, provisional, and absentee ballots, of which it had a backlog of at least 70,000 , and its unofficial results weren’t due until the following day. But the Supervisor of Elections hadn’t publicized the most basic information about what was happening, and in this vacuum of official information, propaganda spread quickly ( created and amplified , without evidence, by Republican politicians).

The stakes felt especially high, with the margins for three statewide races (U.S. senator, governor, and agricultural commissioner) all below .5 percent. According to Florida’s mandatory recount law, similar to the ones in 19 other states, these margins would automatically trigger the first full, statewide recount in history , and the protesters were there to stop what they saw as an influx of fraudulent ballots being snuck in during the recount.

For some, the fraud was so obvious and brazen that it almost defied logic. “The Democrats had their ace here with these 68,000 votes,” said a woman with a five-foot American flag, referring to the constantly updating vote total released by the SOE. “Miraculously! Today’s Friday. The election was Tuesday.”

With states already seeing record numbers of absentee ballots, which are especially prone to being thrown out , it’s almost inevitable that the results will be disputed, However, even under the best of circumstances, recounts are divisive, expensive, laborious, and rarely change the outcome of an election.

Every cycle, there are close races (in 2018, nine House seats were decided by a margin of less than 1 percent), but they often go unnoticed. The election is over, and voters want to move on. That’s unlikely to be the case this time around. Not only is the country exceptionally polarized, but the coronavirus has created chaos over who can vote and how. Already, pandemic-related voting rights issues in at least three states—Alabama, Wisconsin, and Texas—have made their way to the Supreme Court, and that was just for the primaries. For the general, Republicans are aiming to deploy 50,000 “ poll monitors ,” while the Democrats plan to have 600 lawyers on-hand.

This November, given the stakes of the election and the number of competitive races across the country, a similar election nightmare is almost guaranteed. Though the presidential race currently looks like a blowout, it could easily tighten in key swing states during the next few months. And even if Joe Biden scores a decisive win, control of the Senate could be determined by a few thousand votes in Maine, Arizona, or Colorado. There are also roughly 28 House races that the Cook Political Report rates as toss-ups, not to mention elections for state legislatures, which will be in charge of drawing new electoral districts based off the results of this year’s Census.

Take Florida in 2018. That year, after the recounted races went to machine re-tabulation, where all the ballots were fed through the scanners again, three still had a margin below .25 percent, triggering a manual recount of undervotes, overvotes, and write-ins. However, after officials discovered that they had misplaced 2,335 ballots, Broward submitted its original results anyway.

Another county, Palm Beach, didn’t have voting machines capable of running multiple recounts simultaneously. Even working 24/7 for five days, there wasn’t enough time to re-tabulate the 585,117 votes for all three statewide races, let alone for a state representative race, whose margin was 37 votes. Here, a recount may have actually changed the outcome, but the other elections were given priority. Ultimately, though, the point became moot when the county’s 11-year-old machines overheated on day five, invalidating the recount results of roughly 174,000 ballots.

In the end, the greatest vote swing was in the Senate race, where Democrat Bill Nelson gained 274 votes. By the standards of a recount, this was a dramatic change. FairVote, a nonpartisan nonprofit advocating electoral reforms, analyzed 15 statewide recounts between 2000 and 2015 and found that the median shift was 219 votes. Still, Nelson lost by a margin of over 10,000.

Verifying the integrity of an election doesn’t have to be this fraught and time-consuming. Unlike the sloppy, exhausting drama of a recount, risk-limiting audits offer a way to resolve election disputes that’s cheaper, more efficient, and less likely to lead to the meltdowns and conspiracy theories that plagued the 2018 Florida recount. And though they’re technical and unsexy, they’re one of the most effective and bipartisan election reforms available.

A risk-limiting audit (RLA) randomly selects a sub-sample of ballots and verifies that what is marked on the paper actually matches the result that was recorded for that ballot. The closer the race, the more votes are recounted, and the process continues until there’s a “high statistical degree of certainty” that the original results are correct. In small races with tight margins, the sample size may include every vote, but it’s typically much smaller than a full recount.",,
What If Technology Belonged to the People?,"With so many people stuck at home, these internet-first companies were of course well-positioned to provide critical services during a pandemic. But they all got there by leveraging the labor of some of the most vulnerable populations in the world, extracting and selling the data of their customers, getting massive tax breaks, and otherwise taking advantage of huge weaknesses in our economic and political systems. With the economy and society falling apart, these massive companies—already monopolies during “normal” times—are becoming monolithic.

Since the pandemic began, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft have seen their values increase by well over $1.7 trillion. Is it because these companies are offering technologies we all need or is it because they enjoy a series of monopolies that ensure greater wealth and control during a period of great uncertainty?

What, then, is to be done about these companies and their technologies which, on the one hand, facilitate unprecedented communication and address once intractable logistics challenges, but, on the other hand, contribute to widespread suffering everyday? Can we subordinate these technologies, whether they be algorithms or their data sets, to the ends of making a more fair social order? Put simply: Can we create technology that is owned by the people who use it, and whose main purpose is to help humanity rather than extract wealth for a small class of individuals?

Digitization and Privatization

The digitization of our society is an aggressive form of privatization.

Early on in his book on digital capitalism, Jathan Sadowski defines smart technology as tech that “is embedded with digital technology for data collection, network connectivity, and enhanced control.” Sadowski uses the example of smart toothbrushes. These products record detailed data about how you brush your teeth, send that data to some cloud server maintained by some manufacturer or third party, which can then be accessed by you and your dentist through some app to not only guide and monitor your brushing, but score it. It’s not hard to imagine a world where that data is also sold to companies, or are analyzed by a dental insurer and used to calculate your monthly premiums—it’s already here.

If we look at the digitization of insurance more broadly, we quickly find a prime example of how the use of data extraction and surveillance technologies is becoming problematic. Here, digital systems not only amplify the industry’s record as ""one of the greatest sources of regulatory authority over private life"" but are deployed to transform the logic of insurance and its effects on society. Instead of pooling risk by aggregate levels that inform policy options and provide a sort of mutual aid to those in need, companies hope to individually assess risk based on a continuous stream of data on every action an individual does.

Digitization allows those with huge sums of capital to replace old systems of oppression with ones based on surveillance, control, and algorithms.

The operating principles at work here are clear, as Sadowski lays out: “Any risk that insurers must bear is potential loss and any claim insurers have to pay is lost profit. Preventing such losses means controlling the source of risks and claims: customers.""",,
The White Sage Black Market,"This article appears in VICE Magazine's Algorithms issue, which investigates the rules that govern our society, and what happens when they're broken. One evening a few years ago, as the sun was setting over Southern California, Marsha Valencia and her husband returned from a walk in a nature reserve near their home. It was past closing time, and a park ranger in uniform was locking the gates. They ran to catch him, expecting a ticket—in addition to being late, they’d brought their dog, against the rules. The ranger scolded them amiably and made them promise to do better; then, to their surprise, he allowed them to drive through.

Valencia, who identifies as Native American, then asked if she could pick wild sage beside the parking lot. The ranger’s mood changed. He abruptly refused. Valencia explained that she just wanted a few leaves for ceremonial use; the plants would barely be affected at all. “If you pick anything,” the ranger told her, “I’ll have you arrested.” Valencia recently told me how angry this had made her. “This white man is telling me he’s going to arrest me,” she said. “I was like, ‘Excuse me? As an Indigenous woman?’” A youthful 50 year-old with freckled cheeks and greying hair, Valencia meditates and sits in women’s circles; her vibe is abundantly “present.” In almost every respect she is unlike the ranger, Ron Goodman, who loves beer, crude jokes and maintaining order. He also loves football, though he hasn’t watched a game since players began taking the knee. The two of them started talking. Valencia explained that white sage, an herb native to Southern California, was central to her spiritual practice, used by local tribes for thousands of years. She said how difficult it had become to collect in the wild—how, in many places, entire patches had completely vanished. Goodman replied that he knew all about this; that’s why he’d been so harsh with her. Almost daily there were poachers in the reserve, harvesting hundreds of pounds at a time. White sage has become a staple of the wellness era, sold in Walmart and on Amazon and shipped around the world. The plant’s dried leaves are burned for rituals known as “smudging” that have been appropriated from Native American use into the cultural mainstream. The hashtags #WhiteSage and #Smudging appear hundreds of thousands of times on Instagram. Until recently, Goop dubbed its newsletter “inbox sage for the digital age.” Dried sage bundles, or “wands,” are ubiquitous in yoga studios and head shops, but also at concerts, in conference rooms, and even at churches. Protestors in the United States burned sage at recent Black Lives Matter marches; in English cities, there were “sage walks” to ward off the coronavirus. The plant has taken on new resonance in an age of upheaval, widely coming to signify purification and tranquility. In Japan, demand for its purported cleansing properties surged following the Fukushima nuclear disaster.

Yet the supply chain for this global product is almost completely unregulated, driving declines of white sage in the wild and making it harder for Native users to harvest a plant they consider sacred. The species occurs naturally on the plains and mountains of Southern California, across the border in parts of Northern Mexico, and nowhere else on earth. Almost all white sage being sold commercially is “wildcrafted,” or harvested from nature, often by poachers who earn “cents on the dollar,” as Goodman told me. This sage passes through a series of middlemen and wholesalers before reaching the market—usually from companies that market themselves as environmentally conscious. “Everybody wants wellness these days, and they look to Native Americans as people who still have a connection to nature,” said John Banacky, a volunteer who accompanies Goodman on patrols. “They see white sage and they want it. That’s why the market is blowing up.” The small reserve Goodman and Banacky protect has become the epicenter of this market, with reports of poaching almost daily in spring and summer, when white sage is best for harvesting. (VICE is not naming the reserve in the interest of protecting it from additional poaching.) The police have taken to sending out helicopters and sniffer dogs, recording dozens of arrests—and confiscating multiple tons of plant material—in just the last three years. “These aren’t just your holistic shop owners going out and collecting,” Lieutenant Jeff Allison, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, said. “This is clearly a money-making effort.”

Such rampant exploitation has severely stunted the sage, which grew shoulder-high less than a decade ago, forming impenetrable thickets, but now seldom reaches above the waist. When I visited in January, every shrub I saw had multiple woody scars where entire stems had been clipped off. Although the species, Salvia apiana, is not yet classified as threatened, United Plant Savers, a conservation nonprofit, has placed it on its “to watch” list. Cassidy Adlof, an ethnobotanist who wrote a master’s thesis on white sage harvesting, told me that, in addition to rising demand, the species is facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. “I’m concerned about commercial harvest,” Adlof said. A member of the mint family, white sage is a hardy shrub with tapering silver leaves that, like many herbs, grows more vigorously when pruned—but only to a point. The species still thrives in some remote and inaccessible areas, including on private property, but across much of its range has been reduced to mere fragments. This is why poachers are now targeting reserves, risking fines and in some cases jail; outside reserves, where harvesting white sage is still legal, the plant, once abundant, is increasingly scarce. Pickers have stripped sage from highway verges and vacant lots—often coated with soot and other chemicals that customers might not wish to burn in their homes—and backed trucks over fences to rob sage from private land. One woman from Riverside County, a fair distance from the reserve, has twice called the police after finding trespassers cutting sage on her property.

This rush for white sage is starkly at odds with how the plant is consumed, offering a cautionary tale for the wellness economy—one where the virtuous intentions of users can be subverted by unaccountable suppliers, and where even many sellers of sage have no idea of their impacts. Over a single weekend in July, people burning white sage on Instagram included a massage therapist in Puerto Rico, a realtor in Maryland, a nursery owner in Hanoi, a photographer in Sydney. There was a jeweler in Hong Kong and a yoga teacher in Dublin. A medical student from Chicago told me that smudging brought her “peace, calmness and a sense of being grounded,"" adding, “It didn’t cross my mind in terms of being overharvested.” In Switzerland, a self-described “chaos magick practitioner” said she used sage “for cleansing spaces” but had heard, recently, that the species was endangered. A hairdresser from Atlanta, now living in Los Angeles, told me she’d been using white sage since 2015 but only learned last year that it was a Native American ritual. “I was angry with the people who taught me,” she said, “for never bringing that up.”

Valencia grew up in Los Angeles in a family that identified as Hispanic. “We were Mexican,” she said. End of story. One of her grandfathers would occasionally share stories and songs of the Yaqui, a group of tribes with roots in the Sonoran Desert, but her other relatives, she told me, “were afraid to acknowledge who we were.” As in the United States, being identified as indigenous was often dangerous in Mexico, where tribal groups were enslaved and violently dispossessed of land—both during the colonial era and after independence. Over a period of nearly 400 years, Spanish and Mexican authorities waged successive military campaigns against the Yaqui, including several massacres of women and children; as a consequence the tribes became, as one historian wrote in 1947, “probably the most widely scattered of North American Indians.” Thousands of Yaqui fled to the United States, where one tribe, the Pascua Yaqui, was eventually federally recognized and granted land in Arizona. Yet the United States, too, was profoundly hostile to indigenous people, from genocidal wars to forced assimilation into missionaries.

As she grew older, Valencia began questioning her heritage. She made contact with tribal elders who began calling her “The Lost Yaqui.” Her great-grandmother, she discovered, had been a medicine woman who worked with herbs. She asked older relatives about this, but they refused to discuss it. Without documentation of her family history, Valencia said she has been unable to prove that she is descended from the Yaqui or to obtain certification from the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs; this would have permitted her to harvest native plants for personal use, including from nature reserves, although she told me her beliefs would have prevented her from picking sage from damaged plants. (Esperanza Valenzuela, a research assistant at the Pascua Yaqui tribal office, told me that Valencia’s experience—not being able to enroll due to family members renouncing their tribal roots—was “very common.”) In the company of Yaqui people, Valencia said, she often found herself feeling uncomfortable, even embarrassed: “Nobody knows me here. Do I belong?” In her early twenties, Valencia met a Native activist named Julia Bogany who began inviting her to inter-tribal women’s ceremonies. At one of these events, Valencia was smudged for the first time. An elder lit white sage and stirred the smoke with an eagle wing. “My cells recognized the smell,” Valencia said, speaking through tears. “It was like, ‘Welcome home.’”

At that moment she felt herself connected to a spiritual legacy stretching back thousands of years. Along with other fragrant plants like cedar and sweetgrass, white sage is burned for purification and prayer, a custom that was forbidden by federal law until 1978. (An unrelated species, known as white sagebrush or blue sage, was used elsewhere in America and today is also harvested commercially for smudge sticks, although demand is lower and the species is more widespread than white sage.) These traditions survived in spite of prohibitive legislation and began evolving in the 1950s, when the U.S. government set up work programs to draw Native people into cities. Within a decade, the Native population of Los Angeles had more than quadrupled, swelled by migrants from tribal reservations across the country. Amid such sweeping dislocation, white sage “was adopted by urban Indians because it was easy to find,” write the ethnobotanists Rose Ramirez and Deborah Small. “Its use then spread throughout Native America and attained a pan-Indian status.”

At around the same time, California saw the rise of the hippie movement, spurring new interest in alternative medicine and spirituality. For the disaffected children of postwar America, Indian culture—and often stereotypes of it—represented an alternative to the mainstream they were seeking to repudiate. From the fringes of hippie counterculture, white sage was embraced by a widening audience before “exploding” in the New Age era of the 1980s, Ramirez said in an interview this winter. But it wasn't until decades later, with the rise of social media and the wellness industry, that the plant became the commercial phenomenon that it is today. “It’s not something you buy; it’s something that’s given to you” Amazon currently lists more than 1,000 white sage products, including smudge sticks, incense and essential oils. There are all-in-one smudge kits with turkey feathers and abalone shells (traditionally used for cradling burning leaves) and smokeless “smudge sprays” purportedly infused with crystals. There are body creams, soaps, candles, teas. There are smudge combo packs with sticks of Palo Santo, a tree species from Latin America. Amazon even has a “Best Sage Smudging Kit” guide from an affiliate marketing company. “If you’re looking to change up the aura in your home, we’ve highlighted five sage smudging kits for you to try,” the article begins. “Check them out and be pleased with your new energy.” This flagrant commodification of white sage is offensive to many Native people, who see it as profiting off traditional knowledge while threatening the plant’s sustainability. “It’s disrespectful to my ancestors and myself,” said Jessa Calderon, a hip hop artist who has campaigned extensively online against chain stores that stock sage. “These are medicines we’ve used forever.”

In 2018, Sephora removed a “Starter Witch Kit” from its shelves after backlash on social media; that same year, Anthropologie pulled “Home Blessings Smudge Kit.” Yet white sage is still available from major companies like Whole Foods and Walmart, as well as on countless online stores, including innumerable boutiques on Etsy. Goop may have dropped mention of sage from its newsletter, but continues to sell a “Cleanse and Purify Smudge Kit.” “People want to be spiritual. They want to be pure,” Calderon said. “But when you don’t understand somebody’s medicine, and don’t listen, what are you doing?” Many Native users believe that white sage shouldn’t be sold at all. “It’s not something you buy; it’s something that’s given to you,” said Bogany, Valencia’s mentor. (Her tribe, the Gabrielino-Tongva, is recognized by the State of California but not the federal government; this means she, too, cannot legally gather native plants from protected areas.) Traditionally, she explained, sage was harvested with great care, picked by hand and prayed over to give thanks; commercial harvesting is rushed and violent, conducted with pruning shears and hacksaws. “This land is our church,” Bogany said. “It’s like if I walked into church and took the holy water. I would be taking something from God’s house.” Not long ago, some of Calderon’s relatives went to pick sage outside Los Angeles. When they got there, she said, “the sage had been hacked up.” Calderon’s family was left with nothing—“There was no respectful way to harvest further,” she said. This has become a problem for Native people across Southern California: if not of outright extinction, then the erosion of access. For Valencia, who found a sense of belonging through sage, this can feel like an existential threat. “Normally where we’d harvest, it’s no longer possible,” she said. “The sage is disappearing. Are we?”

Before becoming a ranger, Ron Goodman worked in the produce industry, brokering export deals for California farmers; along the way he sourced ingredients for both of Ronald Reagan’s West Coast inaugurations. After retiring, he became a volunteer at the reserve near his home. After putting in more than 4,000 hours, he was offered a staff position. Now in his sixties, Goodman is sunburned and leathery, with an aw-shucks manner that belies his strictness. In January, when I met him, he had a Hulk Hogan mustache from the previous Movember; he’d kept it, he said, “to irritate the wife.” Back in 2014, when he started volunteering at the reserve, sage picking was only a minor problem, with an incident every few weeks at most, he said. This slowly increased until about three years ago, when “everything blew up.” Rangers began catching poachers with 55-gallon trash bins filled with sage, who later switched to using oversized camouflage duffle sacks. Last year, Goodman and his team recorded several busts of more than 1,000 pounds.

A single pound of white sage, enough to fill a paper grocery bag, is worth about $30 at current wholesale prices. Retail prices are substantially higher. Amazon’s top seller of white sage, Alternative Imagination, has smudge sticks costing around $40 per pound, with other companies charging up to $60. (White sage is usually priced by the bundle, and bundles vary in size, making comparisons difficult for customers.) A bust of 1,000 pounds, then, amounts to $30,000 sold wholesale, or around $50,000 at market value. Of these sums, police say that pickers earn no more than a few dollars a pound—enough, nevertheless, to drive an epidemic of illegal harvesting. According to Goodman, the pickers are predominantly Latino men; he believes many are recent immigrants. (One in five people in the surrounding region are immigrants, with advocacy groups estimating that nearly a third are undocumented.) “For many of the guys, I think this is their only opportunity,” Goodman said. “They’re not the problem—it’s the people who pay them.” Most brands selling white sage do not harvest it themselves, instead sourcing from a network of wholesalers and middlemen. Tracing the connections between poachers and these companies is difficult—and beyond the capacity of local police. “It’s not something we’d normally assign a detective to,” said Lieutenant Allison, from the county sheriff’s department. “We just don’t have the resources for that.”

Within the small community of people paying attention to white sage, however, one company in particular is often blamed for over-harvesting. Juniper Ridge is a fragrance brand out of a #VanLife fantasy, offering hand-foraged scents from the American wilderness. There’s the Sierra Forest body wash, the Redwood Mist cologne, a collection of natural incense sticks. There are eight varieties of white sage product, including loose leaves, smudge wands, perfume and tea. The company website has pictures of white people getting their hands dirty in beautiful places: alpine slopes, muddy trails, mossy embankments. “We are building a new fragrance grammar of the American West,” reads a section on the About page. Juniper Ridge claims to donate 10 percent of its profits to conservation causes and says they harvest plants with “utmost sensitivity and respect for the existing wildscape.” Yet the company, which operates as both a retailer and wholesaler of white sage, has been accused for years of overharvesting white sage. As early as 2015, the founder of Juniper Ridge, Hall Newbegin, felt compelled to write a blog post defending himself, arguing that white sage could be “harvested sustainably indefinitely.” Juniper Ridge only picked sage on private land, he said, blaming other companies for causing the problem. “I’m probably one of a dozen people in the world who knows all the harvesting crews,” he wrote. “The crews that clearcut the white sage fields needs [sic] to be stopped.”

I tried several times to contact Newbegin; if he was being honest, I thought he’d want to talk to a reporter. I also wanted to ask about an encounter he’d had with Susan Leopold, the executive director of United Plant Savers, who met with him in March 2019 to see where Juniper Ridge sourced its sage. According to Leopold, Newbegin took her to the reserve where Ron Goodman works, seemingly unaware that harvesting sage there was illegal. When she challenged him, she said, he changed his story, telling her that Juniper Ridge sourced white sage cultivated on farms. I never managed to get hold of Newbegin. This June, at the age of 52, he fell down a flight of stairs and broke his neck, dying of heart failure after surgery. The chief operating officer of Juniper Ridge, Leah Fritts, wrote to me in an email that Juniper Ridge was “transitioning to 100% cultivated white sage” but that Newbegin’s death had delayed the process. “Regardless,” she said, “we have always harvested White Sage with great care.”

The transformation of white sage from indigenous medicine to commercial product is not a singular story. In the 1990s, wildcrafters in the United States poured onto tribal lands to harvest echinacea, a traditional Native American herb that now supports a global market worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually. At the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, in Montana, brokers for herbal companies held competitions to find the largest root; a local six year-old boy who placed second at one of these events told the reservation newspaper that he was “heavy into rooting.” Tribal members soon fell into bitter disputes about the harvest, which had become an important source of income but also led to declines of the plant. Rising demand also led to poaching on federal reserves across the Midwest; in one incident, a biker gang from Kansas was found digging echinacea in South Dakota—they were on their way to a rally, and the roots were to fund the trip. The rise of echinacea farming has helped offset some of this demand, but countless other species remain at risk from commercial harvesting. The value of the global trade in medicinal and aromatic plants was valued at $3.3 billion in 2018—a nearly threefold increase from two decades earlier. Of the approximately 26,000 plant species with documented medicinal or aromatic uses, fewer than a fifth have been assessed for conservation threats, according to a recent report by the conservation nonprofit Traffic. As much as 90 percent of the trade is supplied by wild harvesters, often from rural or impoverished communities. This vast and expanding industry operates largely free of oversight, its environmental and cultural costs invisible to most customers. Hundreds of species face extinction in the wild, including the plants used to produce frankincense and shea butter.

Bryony Morgan is the executive officer of the FairWild Foundation, a certification scheme for wildcrafted plants that seeks to promote fair labor standards and sustainable harvesting. “It’s the nature of these trade chains,” she said. “There’s a lot of middlemen, a lot of traders. Often people have no idea where wild ingredients are coming from.”

Last winter, I began contacting companies that sell white sage. Most declined to tell me where their products originated. Sacred Eagle Imports, an online store based in England, indicated that they imported white sage from multiple wholesalers and had no mechanisms in place to ensure sustainable sourcing. Bursera, a company in Canada that advertises farmed white sage, said the identity of their supplier was “proprietary information.” Alternative Imagination also claims to use farmed white sage; when I called their shop in Florida, a woman named Alison said they sourced from “a mixture of smaller suppliers and wholesalers” that changed according to “who was harvesting.” Other companies weren’t sure where their white sage came from, such as Moonbeams and Fairy Dust, a store in Virginia that offers smudge sticks “sustainably harvested by Native Americans.” When I emailed to ask for details, the owner replied: “I buy them from another vendor that claims that. I honestly don’t know how to verify this information.” “The sage is disappearing. Are we?” The vendor she buys from, Windrose Trading, says on its website that its smudge sticks are “sustainably harvested by Native Americans” and that “a portion of sales supports a Native American reservation cooperative.” I contacted the company by phone and by email, hoping for more details, but never heard back. Another major wholesaler of white sage is Native Scents, a company based in Taos, New Mexico. The owner is a man named Alfred Savinelli who was implicated in a major LSD bust in 2000 and who claimed in a 2017 VICE documentary—misleadingly, it turns out—to have pioneered the practice of smoking hallucinogenic toad slime. So I was intrigued, but also wary, when he told me in February that he’d “invented the market” for white sage.

The son of an Italian father and Native American mother, Savinelli said he started working with medicinal plants in the 1970s, after apprenticing with the Lakota Sioux leader Archie Lame Deer; then he laughed, as he did throughout our conversation, and added: “Or was it that plants started working with me?” In the 1980s, he began harvesting sage from the mountains near Santa Barbara, often camping out for weeks at a time. First he worked solo; then he recruited a crew of pickers, supplying traders up and down the coast. His sales increased until the turn of the millennium, when he says white sage “became a worldwide phenomenon.” He began shipping internationally, including to the Middle East, where he believes his customers included members of the US military. “I didn’t see over the horizon of what this market would become,” he told me. “Sage went from being something special to a commodity.” Demand had started outstripping supply, he said. “The esoteric wisdom of Native people has become a fad.” This hadn’t stopped him from selling the plant himself; just that week he’d spent $30,000 on wildcrafted sage from San Diego. “I guess you could say I have mixed feelings,” he said. Then he changed track and mounted a defense of wild harvesting. Concerns about sage were “unfounded and untrue.” Harvesting the plant only made it grow faster. White sage created income for marginalized pickers. The supply was endless if you knew where to look.

In search of more sustainable sources of white sage, I drove south to meet Ellen Woodward and Ken Taylor, a hippie couple in their 70s who claim to be the world’s first commercial farmers of the plant. They live east of San Diego, at the edge of the Colorado Desert and less than three miles from the Mexican border; migrant trails wind through the granite hills, surveilled by border agents and private militias. The landscape is sparse and militarized, making the entrance to Woodward and Taylor’s property especially incongruous: a giant hand-painted board in psychedelic colors, surrounded by stars, swirls and synesthetic blobs, that reads SAGE WINDS FARM. I arrived after dark and drove up to the farmhouse, where I was greeted by an assortment of shy, friendly dogs. The porch was spilling over with geraniums and succulents. There were wind chimes and rocking chairs and a “Hippies Use Backdoor” sign. Through the window I could see Woodward hunched over at a computer, cradling a cordless phone with her shoulder and leafing vigorously through a notebook. She is tiny and wrinkled and energetic and quite deaf; she tends to talk loudly, so I could hear everything she was saying.

“Did you pay when you made the order? That’s very unusual.” “You bet almost all sage is wild harvested. We actually farm sage.” “You know they use sage in Japan? I believe they’re using it to soak up radiation.” She was wearing a tie-dyed shirt with long, loose sleeves, and her white hair glowed in the light of the screen. When she finished I rapped on the window, worried I’d startle her, but she burst out laughing and threw open the door. Inside I met Taylor, who is older and quieter, with thinning hair and a white goatee, and several more dogs that bounded around us. Woodward yelled at the dogs and asked me a question: “Do you smoke pot? We’re potheads. We vaporize. We’re about to do that right now.” In the morning, after firing up the vaporizer again, she showed me around the farm. In front of the house lay a plot of about an acre with white sage growing in uneven rows. The plants were bushy and tall, orbited by bees, with lush, soft, pungent shoots. Unlike most crops in California, white sage is adapted to the landscape, requiring little water and no fertilizer. The species is also resilient to pests. Woodward wages battle against gophers and rabbits, flooding tunnels and laying traps, but otherwise, she told me, “the sage looks after itself.” Sage Winds has been certified organic since 2013—the first such farm in the United States, Woodward says. (Her son-in-law has begun farming white sage in San Diego, as have two companies in Oregon.) Later, we spent some time browsing Amazon for organic smudge sticks. “We don’t sell to them, don’t sell to them either,” Woodward frowned. “Man, this is all bullshit!”

Woodward grew up in an upper-middle-class New England family and studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, but was expelled at 19 for having an abortion. Her boyfriend was a Black man named Eric; they married soon afterwards and moved to San Diego. “So that was something for my family to deal with,” she told me. “In the South, there’d have been crosses burning in our yard.” In the 1980s she became a tie-dye artist, traveling to New Age markets across the country. Later she began picking sage to sell with her designs. But as demand grew, she said, she was disturbed by its impacts. “Wild harvesters go out with big trucks,” she said. “They bring distillers for making oil. They’re out to get all the sage they can get.” In around 2010, she and Taylor began trying to cultivate the plant, using seeds from white sage growing naturally on their land. It took three years of trial and error. “You have to understand how the plant grows,” Woodward said. “You have to harvest really respectfully.” Since then, their orders have shot up to around $70,000 per year, with customers around the world: in New Zealand, South Africa, Germany, Mongolia. Their biggest market besides the United States is in Japan, where several companies have standing orders of more than $1,000 monthly. “The demand is so heavy, and it just keeps increasing,” Woodward said. “It’s being used as a crop. It should be grown as a crop.” Not everyone agrees that farming is the solution; instead, some users have begun growing the plant at home. Commercial farming is “feeding the same market,” said Calderon, the rapper. “People are profiting off something they have no business profiting off.” When I asked Taylor, who grew up in Texas, what he made of this criticism, he nodded sadly and said: “I can sympathize with that.” But given the scale of demand, he said, farming was necessary. “We’re adding to the sage, not taking away.” A few years ago, he said, members of a nearby Kumeyaay tribal reservation began ordering smudge sticks, sometimes as many as 1,000 a year. “They’re happy we’re farming it,” Taylor said.",,
A Plague on Ibiza,"The light was just beginning to turn in Ibiza Town, smudging the boxy, cluttered street into something slightly more inviting. It was January, and a line of taxis waited patiently for no one. The clubs were closed, the superyachts were gone, and DJ Paris Hilton was 6,000 miles away, posting an Instagram story of her dog Diamond Baby in a carpeted Las Vegas hotel room. Shutters in the old town of Dalt Vila were drawn, signaling empty rentals reserved for tourists. Palm trees swayed quietly at the port.

This article appears in VICE Magazine's Algorithms issue , which investigates the rules that govern our society, and what happens when they're broken.

When we met, Montes was one of the primary local researchers studying the Hemorrhois hippocrepis, or horseshoe whip snake, a medium-sized, fairly understated-looking snake with large round eyes and a horseshoe-like pattern on its head. Since the first sighting in 2003, three snake species have been introduced to Ibiza and Formentera, known as the Pityusic Islands, but the horseshoe whip snake, Montes’s subject, is now the most common in Ibiza. It’s native to southern Spain and other areas in the region, but considered invasive in Ibiza, which sits about 60 miles off the mainland coast in the southwest corner of the Balearic archipelago. Although the snakes aren’t poisonous to humans, Montes’s research suggests that they are endangering the survival of an iconic local lizard.

For many people living elsewhere, the word “Ibiza” might conjure images of Leonardo DiCaprio hovering above the sea on a flyboard, or British tourists falling off balconies to their deaths , or a 2018 Netflix comedy about a publicist who falls in love with a DJ . Snakes aren’t really part of the brand. But since arriving unexpectedly in the early 2000s, then fanning out like fingers gently stretching out from the island’s northeast flank, herpetofauna have become a local preoccupation.

Elba Montes was waiting for me in a small white Volkswagen SUV. “Should we go to my house?” she asked. At the time, Montes was an environmental project manager with the local government in Ibiza, and a biodiversity and evolutionary biology PhD student at the University of Valencia. She had a good-humored expression, and brown hair streaked with auburn dye. “There are snakes in the freezer.”

“This was a story which I always believed,” Brosius continued. (Brosius was not entirely alone; a landscape architect told me that a friend occasionally takes his pet boa on trips off the island for preventative health reasons.) “And so I said oh, not a big problem, they’re going to die off. But all of a sudden I found they became more and more and more.”

“There was a story on the island that snakes will never survive because of the soil,” said Bernd Brosius, a retired landscaping business owner. Pliny the Elder declared something to this effect in the year 77, and the island itself, Eivissa, is believed to have been named after the ancient god Bes, who was sometimes depicted with a knife in one hand and a snake in the other (or occasionally strangling snakes with both his hands). Until 2003, no wild snakes of any species had been documented on the Pityusic islands, aside from a dwarf viper that disappeared when humans first arrived 4,000 years ago. This ominous historical context has not gone unremarked upon in scientific papers , newspaper articles and a letter from local activists scolding government officials .

Though the term “invasive species” can imply some measure of intent, snakes did not simply decide to come to Ibiza, much like wasps did not ship themselves to Hawaii inside of Christmas trees , or how Canadian beavers did not paddle all the way down to Tierra del Fuego determined to plow through an old-growth forest . People brought them. The earliest government documentation of a snake in Ibiza was in the village of Sant Josep de sa Talaia, after a man sprayed water inside the trunk of an olive tree imported from Córdoba, Spain, and inadvertently caused the animal to flee.

Montes’s three-legged cat flounced past us as she showed me around her home, a whitewashed space with high ceilings that she shared with her landlord. She considers herself lucky to be able to afford her rent, she told me later, which, she said, is “really really really cheap compared to everything here.” She wasn’t planning to stay in Ibiza for much longer.

We drove into the pink afternoon towards Montes’s house in the middle of the island, past billboards squealing FULL MOON AMNESIA and DANCE OR DIE USHUAÏA and something about DAVID GUETTA. Montes lived in an old flour mill attached to a shuttered vintage store, a dusty white structure rising abruptly against the sky on the side of the road, in an area where snakes are thought to be abundant (snakes are shy, and hard to find). Two gigantic beheaded palm trees stood stubbornly in the front and back of the house, reduced to eerie monuments of themselves.

Local reporting on the topic has been extensive —the Spanish newspaper El Mundo dubbed Ibiza and Formentera an “Eden for snakes”; another 2018 article featured a dead snake, several meters long, hanging off the claw of a bulldozer with its entrails hanging out. There’s even a Facebook group for English-speaking Ibiza residents called “Snakes In Ibiza No Thank You” dedicated to snake news, trapping methods, and the occasional photograph, including one of a small boy clutching a large snake vertically in one hand, his eyes wide with wonder.

Researchers and government officials in the Balearic Islands believe that these olive trees—usually uprooted from their groves on the mainland and shipped as landscaping products—have likely been the main pathway for the snakes’ entry (though there’s often more than one way in, and other imports, like bales of hay, could also be contributing). The snakes, which have been seen and photographed on and around the trees, share a habitat with the region of Spain where many of the olive trees come from, and their appearance correlates with what researchers have called the “exponential” growth in the trees’ importation to the Balearic Islands. According to a 2019 report , ornamental olive trees have also introduced the common yellow scorpion to Ibiza, as well as Macrothele calpeiana, a very large European spider.

Over the years, opulent gardens have bloomed in Ibiza. But because plants are living habitats, they tend to collect other creatures. When they are moved, guests often come along. A knobby old olive tree with snakes in it is an unusually biblical demonstration of this rule—“They have holes, crevices, different areas where animals can hide inside,” said Samuel Pinya, a biologist at the University of the Balearic Islands.

The earth itself is always churning; the universe expands, neutron stars collide, Selling Sunset ’s Chrishell Stause transitions to listings in the Valley.

Meanwhile, according to a 2017 report on Ibiza’s socio-environmental carrying capacity, the income of an average worker has barely covered basic housing costs. In past years, some seasonal workers have had to rent balconies . The island’s economy is built around hospitality , but for workers, “it’s very hard here, the life in Ibiza,” said Milagros Carreño, a local spokesperson for Las Kellys, a national labor group representing housekeepers in the tourism sector. Carreño takes valium and anti-inflammatories every day to keep up with the workload, she said, which, when we spoke through a translator in early July, she expected to increase with coronavirus-related precautions. “Our bodies are destroyed by this work.”

Until very recently, the Balearic Islands were a major tourist destination in Spain, which is the second-most visited country in the world. At the time of my visit, just before the pandemic hit, Ibiza was home to the world’s most expensive restaurant , as well as a club called Amnesia whose owner was arrested in 2016 during a money laundering raid, and a gated community for millionaires complete with a “nondenominational temple” that was built on a foundation of crushed crystals . Real estate prices have increased significantly in recent decades, a real estate agent in the luxury Mediterranean market told me in March, and “quite a few northern Europeans have chosen Ibiza as a place to live, to bring their kids, and have a healthier, more relaxed life, rather than living in the insanity of London or Paris or wherever.”

At her house, Montes showed me a photo of a blue-ish Ibiza wall lizard intact inside the open stomach of a snake, surrounded by an unusually large layer of fat. She also took out the snakes, frozen in permanent figure-eight patterns. She had caught and killed them in her yard, and was keeping them for future study. They looked like plastic toys, slightly mangled. One was large, with dried orange-red blood on its underside and its jaw bent open in an unnatural position. Another was tiny, curled delicately into itself like a loose bowline knot.

Similar to places like Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands , economic development, tourism and tourism-adjacent urban sprawl in the archipelago has been associated with an assortment of environmental pressures beyond the snakes, from water supply issues to “a continuous discharge of sewage ” into the sea. “The economic system is embedded within the natural system,” said Ivan Murray, a geography lecturer at the university who co-authored the carrying capacity report.

“If we hadn't these capricious rich people who wanted the Mediterranean garden because it's fashion, then we wouldn't have the snakes,” Montes said bluntly.

Gardening is not exclusive to the ultra-wealthy, and neither is tourism in Ibiza, which historically has been more closely associated with 20-somethings in a K-hole trawling for “hot birds .” But these particular ornamental trees—occasionally over a thousand years old—can sell for anywhere from several hundred to around 50,000 euros each, and are mostly bought by second home-owners, hotel complexes, developers, and other high-income buyers.

Only a small percentage of species relocated by humans end up having impacts that are considered harmful towards the health, economy or ecosystem of their new home, earning them the “invasive” category. But the total number being pinballed around the world continues to grow , and on islands in particular, where species have evolved in relatively isolated, sometimes fantastical ways, invasive species are considered a serious threat to biodiversity. Islands often lack entire groups of fauna, such as (in Ibiza’s case) snakes, making whoever evolved there potentially more vulnerable to certain newcomers. Islands also import a lot of things, leading to higher rates of species introductions. In an escalating extinction crisis , the stakes are high.

Montes, who is originally from Galicia, Spain, began working with the snakes in Ibiza as a government employee. In 2014, she and a coworker at the Consell Insular D’Eivissa, the local island government, decided to do a pilot project testing different kinds of snake traps. A regional government employee had sounded the alarm on the ecological threat the snakes posed when they were first discovered over a decade earlier, but little had been done. In the process, she met a professor of zoology at the University of Granada, who would become her PhD advisor.

“If they are here and they are bad for the island, it’s because of us, not because of them,” she said, the last light fading through the glass doors as we sat down at her kitchen table.

At the time of my visit, Montes was readying a chapter of her dissertation for submission to a journal, co-authored by her advisor Juan Pleguezuelos, Brahim Chergui, an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Hassan II Casablanca in Morocco, and Fred Kraus, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Michigan. Snakes are hard to study because they’re hard to find; researchers often have to rely on rough indicators like traps and reported sightings. But Montes performed a census in 2018 suggesting that the island’s mascot is rapidly disappearing, and that the horseshoe whip snakes are responsible: in areas determined to have high horseshoe whip snake densities, she found no lizards. She also found no lizards on an offshore islet previously observed to have them, shortly after a snake was captured swimming its way.

“The lizards have been in danger because of the cats, the dogs, kestrels,” Montes said. “But this is new.” A warning lurked nearby: a few thousand years ago, an introduced snake is believed to have contributed to the extinction of a similar lizard, the Lilford’s wall lizard, from the main islands of Menorca and Mallorca.

In 2016, Montes co-authored a study led by PhD student Arlo Hinckley that found that a substantial percentage of the horseshoe whip snake’s diet was composed of the speckled Ibiza wall lizard, or Podarcis pityusensis. The lizards are part of the story the island tells itself and its visitors, their friendly outline reproduced on bumper stickers, tourist tchotchkes, wooden gates and lawn ornaments. They’re the lone native reptile in Ibiza and Formentera, and as an endemic species, the sub-archipelago is their only natural range; they’re also seed dispersers, playing an important role in the island’s ecosystem. On islets surrounding Ibiza, where they have evolved in tiny isolated populations, they appear in spectacular, gemlike shades of blue and other colors.

Though she does store their dead mangled bodies in her freezer, Montes loves horseshoe whip snakes. Her face brightened visibly when she talked about them. She even hand-painted an image of one with soulful green-flecked eyes for a PowerPoint presentation on their reproductive ecology. We watched a video of two males fighting elegantly for dominance, swiveling their heads on top of each other's without touching until one declared victory, like a mimed thumb war.

Something similar happened in Guam, where Montes visited in 2017 to learn about the snake control mechanisms implemented there. Guam is often cited as a sort of worst-case-scenario in the field of invasion biology. In the decades after poisonous brown tree snakes arrived, probably in U.S. military cargo, six lizard species vanished, and, famously, most of the island’s native birds. In their place, the forests are filled with spiderwebs .

But Montes is firm about the implications of her findings. “If the snakes spread throughout the island, then the lizard will be gone from the island,” she predicted.

The study hasn’t completed peer review or been accepted for publication yet, and in past years the snake threat hasn’t been settled among researchers. “There are some people saying there is an impact, others that are saying there is not an impact,” summarized Samuel Pinya. “My opinion is that there is an impact, but up to date we cannot quantify that impact.”

“In the last years I told the guys, listen boys, I don’t want to bring in any more fucking snakes, please put hot water in all the olive trees so the snakes come out,” he said. (Washing the trees is one technique some sellers use before sending them to more strictly regulated destinations.)

“I brought in containers and containers and containers of these trees to the island,” Brosius recalled in a phone call. Researchers and nursery owners associate the ornamental olive tree trade with faster rates of tree turnover as olive oil production intensified. The trees are often uprooted and moved in the winter, when their growth has slowed—“otherwise the tree suffers,” he explained. But he hadn’t realized, he said, that inside the dormant trees were hibernating snakes.

Some years following the snakes’ first appearance, many documented sightings were clustered near a landscaping company called—appropriately enough—Noah’s Garden. There is no single party responsible for the snakes’ arrival and subsequent success on the island, and snakes have been found in multiple garden centers. But the former owner Bernd Brosius, now retired, had helped out with the snake control project Montes worked on, and she suggested I get in touch.

She often dreams of snakes, she confided later. Sometimes, in the dreams, they turn into a viper and kill her, but recently they’ve been gentler, transforming into impossible technicolor versions of themselves.

“I hate to kill them,” she muttered. Once a snake is caught, the protocol is to knock them unconscious against a hard surface and then smash them in the head with a rock or hammer.

On a cool rainy day I met Eric Montcerisier, the landscape architect whose friend takes his boa off the island, for coffee in a trendy hotel lobby near the port in town. He had thinning gray hair, a black scarf tied precisely around his neck, and a relaxed, sun-drenched face. A small T. rex fossil reconstruction roared over the couch area, and to our right, a large glass refrigerator lit with clubby red lighting contained a pig carcass hanging on a meat hook.

A few were visibly sick, I noticed, with hacked-off limbs or browning leaves, throwing another wrench in the impression they were clearly meant to give: that things had always been like this, and maybe always would be.

The new old olive trees are common in Ibiza—there are properties on the island with dozens of them—though some clearly homegrown trees are also dotted around the island, in one case looming like elderly grandfathers in angry, splintered clusters over an ancient grave site. I spotted them at garden centers, in front of a clothing store near the port in Ibiza Town, leaning over the edge of a pristine Mediterranean garden, standing in the elegant courtyard of a renowned architectural firm on the island.

When I visited Noah’s Garden, I spent some time gawking at one of Brosius’s olive trees, which was so large and twisted and overwhelmingly beautiful that it looked like it ought to be accompanied by a centaur. He told me that it was his male customers who really pushed to buy them: “This, for men, means power.”

“Ultimately it comes down to, well maybe we shouldn’t be moving plants at all, which is probably a non-starter,” remarked Dave Rizzo, chair of the department of plant pathology at UC Davis.

Globally, the horticultural industry is hugely varied, ranging from beloved local shops running on thin margins and native plant nurseries that work on ecological restoration projects to breeders, seed companies, giant multinational corporations and online marketplaces. But its impacts can be enormous—rhododendrons planted at a resort, for example, are believed to have introduced an oomycete called Phytophthora ramorum, which has killed millions of oak and tanoak trees on the West Coast, to the Big Sur area.

Montcerisier observed that Ibiza is “getting a little bit more glamour, a little bit more like Saint Tropez.” Over the years, many people came to invest in large homes, he said, and they want high quality landscapes, though he tries to steer his clients away from thirsty tropical plants and toward native species. With increasing volumes of plant imports, Montcerisier explained, came others. “We imported the beetle, we imported the snakes, we imported the bacteria.”

Ibiza, Montcerisier told me dreamily, has a “special earth energy,” some kind of magnetic quality, a belief also shared by travel blogs aimed at wellness tourists. I hadn’t personally experienced this magnetism, though I was momentarily trapped in Mallorca when my destination airport in Alicante burst into flames, which was weird. Mostly I just had insomnia. I kept finding dying bugs rolling around on their backs on the floor near my bed, which felt thematically a little too on-the-nose.

In 1560, as Alfred Crosby wrote in The Columbian Exchange, the olive tree was first introduced into what had recently become Lima, Peru by a man named Antonio de Rivera. He brought seedlings back from Spain, guarding them with slaves, at about the same time that the Inca people of the region were being killed in devastating numbers by Spanish diseases. Today the trees, known as Parque El Olivar, are “ practically drowning ” thanks to 25 acres of imported crabgrass installed around the grove.

However, as Pickett and Richard Ostfeld warned a few years later, “the flux in the natural world has severe limits.”

There is no harmonious moment in the past when life was static, or safe. Nature, as the ecologist Steward Pickett defined it in 1992, is flux . Humans have been shifting themselves and other species around the globe for millennia, driving extinctions left and right, and populations have been migrating and floating to new places for longer. The earth itself is always churning; the universe expands, neutron stars collide, Selling Sunset ’s Chrishell Stause transitions to listings in the Valley. The Balearic Islands were once connected to the rest of the Iberian peninsula, separating from it, and each other, at the end of the Messinian period.

The bacteria mentioned by Montcerisier—a pathogen called Xylella fastidiosa that’s considered invasive—has killed millions of olive trees in Italy, and is also in the Balearic Islands, choking off the trees’ water supply and turning their silvery-green leaves to a crunchy rust. The beetle, called the red palm weevil, eats the hearts of (also imported) Phoenix canariensis palm trees so vigorously that you can sometimes hear them chewing .

Ultimately, governing bodies are responsible for imposing regulations, and Montes’s latest paper includes suggestions, like quarantines, to prevent olive trees from bringing snakes into the Balearic Islands—which still hasn’t been done, frustrating Montes and local environmental activists , who have pushed hard for regulatory changes. Balearic government officials have argued that European trade laws make it difficult to regulate certain importations within the bloc.

Today, research has homed in on the human activities behind these movements. The plant trade plays a role, as does ballast water on ships, the exotic pet trade, tourism, cargo containers, the U.S. military , even the billions of tons of plastics in the ocean now apparently serving as highly durable rafts . People have shuffled other creatures around for lots of reasons—including as ill-advised biocontrol agents for other invasive species—but researchers have found that the number of introduced species often correlates with economic growth (though invasive species are also studied more in wealthy countries).

During the period of European colonial expansion, white settlers inflicted themselves and their menageries on new places all over the world, with vast ecological legacies still chomping around today . In New Zealand, “invasive species are just another form of colonization,” said Amanda Black, a research scientist and co-founder of the Māori Biosecurity Network, or Te Tira Whakamātaki. With industrialization, globalization and the expansion of consumer capitalism, the pace and spread of species translocations kept ratcheting up all over the world, and Europe increasingly got a taste of its own medicine.

“We are always late,” he said at a coffee shop in Ibiza Town, speaking through my translator, a shy vegan teenager with long talon nails and a septum piercing. “Because when they arrive, we are already late.”

The day I met him, Victor Colomar seemed irritated. He’s a regional government employee in charge of managing invasive species across the Balearic Islands, which is, he told me several times, a really difficult job. Though it’s been achieved on islands, it is often impossible to get rid of a species by the time they have become a problem.

“Look at what’s going on with COVID testing,” explained Dave Rizzo. “You’ve got a shipment of a million plants, you can’t test every single one, inevitably something is going to go through.”

No one really expects to stop the transport of species entirely, to be clear. The idea is generally to slow the pace.

“She’s always saying we are not doing all we should do to fight against the snakes in Ibiza,” Ivan Ramos, the head of the Species Protection Service for the Balearic government, said of Montes. “But we don’t agree with her, because most of our money is used to fight against invasive species and especially against the snakes in Ibiza.” Government traps have captured 2,700 snakes in Ibiza since 2016; using funds from the Balearic Islands’ “Sustainable Tourism Tax,” they’re increasing the number of snake traps and personnel on the island in an effort to better control the population. This year, Ramos told me, they hope to hire a team of lawyers to develop laws regulating the olive tree trade with the peninsula.

“Formerly, all of these forests were transformed into farmlands, because people were very hungry,” Colomar said. A degree of human disturbance has favored the Ibiza wall lizards—they like the open spaces and rock walls that crisscross the island’s landscape. But as the island abandoned farming, he said, the forests began to recover ground.

We arrived at our destination, a flat clearing backed by forest that looked out past shrubland onto low green hills leading out to the sea. Scores of ornamental olive trees had been planted at an enormous villa rental nearby, he said, which he believes initiated the snake population in this area. Several meters away from one of the simple wooden snake traps was a low stone wall. The snakes and lizards share a habitat, and inside this wall, he said, both were hibernating.

He doesn’t have a problem with goats, or snakes, or cats, he said, as we drove up one of the island’s main roadways, on our way to look at snake traps. “I have a problem with irresponsible people.” He became a bit heated, letting out a “pfft” noise that in Spain seems to mean everything is so stupid, no? Oh well. He mentioned, with disdain, that people in Madrid began buying racoons as pets after watching Pocahontas. Now they’re everywhere, and some of them have rabies.

Colomar is a veterinarian by training, but his job mostly involves coordinating strategies for eliminating animals across the Balearic Islands, including charismatic or culturally valued species. A recent attempt to remove the goats that were eroding and destroying the endemic vegetation on es Vedra—a famous islet off Ibiza’s coast plagued by persistent rumors of UFO sightings—was placed on pause after a lawsuit, he told me. The goat population has begun to recover, and Colomar said his team will likely have to shoot more goats than originally anticipated to finish the job.

“I don’t have to kill genets,” he said. “Nature has already changed, I can't do anything. We can’t go back to the prehistoric era. We exist in the current world.”

If Montes is right, the snakes in Ibiza could end up being a stark example of what we lose when a blender is carelessly taken to the living planet. But sometimes the picture isn’t so clear. In the Balearic Islands, for example, where most land vertebrates have been introduced, she noted that the line marking an animal as “native” can, in some cases, be hard to distinguish . Colomar mentioned a subspecies of genet, a spotted cat-like mammal, that was introduced there a long time ago and has since integrated into the ecosystem.

“Restoration ecology often thinks about these threats as simultaneous,” she replied. “And that if the system is impacted by a lot of human disturbances, that system is going to be much more susceptible to exotic species coming in, which then will change it even more, and you’ll start kind of tumbling down this hill.”

When I was back in the U.S., I asked Katharine Suding, a plant community ecologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, how introduced species tend to fit into this constellation of human impacts.

Montes’s research suggests that other factors, including forest regrowth, can’t explain the dramatic changes she observed. Colomar agrees with Montes that the snakes—particularly the horseshoe whip snakes—threaten the Ibiza wall lizards, and he believes that without them, the lizard populations would cling on. But the lizards, Colomar emphasized, have been under additional pressures, like cats, pesticides, and land use change.

Species translocations are a complex and context-dependent process, and the categories that frame the field of invasion science are often contentious. Some have argued, controversially, that a species’ origin shouldn’t matter, or that invasive species are more benign than advertised, or that the field itself shouldn’t exist, and some scientists have responded with heated declarations of “invasive species denialism.”

Folded in are ongoing calls of xenophobia, as critics have compared conservation efforts to keep nonhumans in their imagined-to-be-natural place with racist and nationalist anxieties around human migration. As Smithsonian has reported, terms like “alien” and “invasion” certainly are the same ones that Trump and other white nationalists use to demonize immigrants and refugees, and particularly in a time of rising ecofascism—and regular fascism—it can be hard to hear them as neutral, regardless of scientists’ intent. Of course, geopolitical borders often don’t even sync up with nonhuman communities. The snakes causing problems in Ibiza are from Spain, and the olive trees are a commodified expression of Balearic heritage.

Complications are everywhere. As scientists regularly note, the “negative” impacts that generally define a species as invasive are subjective, to varying degrees (and not everyone uses impacts to define what’s “invasive”). One team of researchers recently went so far as to suggest that Pablo Escobar’s “cocaine hippos” are stepping into ecosystem roles lost during the late Pleistocene. Climate change adds its own twists, further complicating origin labels (or, some have argued, dismantling the native/non-native binary entirely).

Some animals who are threatened by invasive species in one place might even face eradication attempts in another. The Ibiza wall lizards, though technically endemic to the Pityusic Islands, are also considered invasive on the Basque islet of San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, a former Game of Thrones set. What then?

It’s easy to fall down a whirlpool here. But for many, like Julissa Rojas-Sandoval, a researcher at the University of Connecticut who studies invasive plants in the Caribbean, inaction is unacceptable. “If the species is impacting native species or unique species that you have in the area, you need to do something,” she told me. “The point is that we are the ones who are moving these species.”

Back at the trapping site, we returned to Colomar’s car and drove down the hill. I strained to glimpse the viIla’s olive trees through a surrounding fence, and asked if he’d contacted the owners.

“They haven’t done anything illegal. What can I say? ‘I don’t like what you have done’?” Colomar laughed. “They’re not the only ones.”

Since I was in Ibiza, a lot has changed.

Martin Cristóbal Torres, a gardener, belongs to the anarcho-syndicalist union CGT, which he told me has helped feed dozens of struggling families. In Ibiza, as everywhere, the pandemic is exacerbating existing inequities and injustices. In general, “it takes a lot more work to convince someone to hire a Senegalese person than a Spanish person,” said Ndiaga Sarr, president of the Senegalese Association of Ibiza and Formentera, speaking in French. Now, he said, though a limited tourism reopening has begun, jobs are even more scarce.

Celebrities and the ultra-rich, the BBC reported, have been enjoying the quiet. A recent report by a real estate company specializing in luxury properties noted that inquiries have increased since the onset of the pandemic.

The coronavirus, which some researchers have been comparing to an invasive species, has demonstrated the extent to which humans are suspended within ecological systems, and, as Ferris Jabr wrote in the New York Times Magazine, the extent to which humans have unilaterally re-shaped and harmed those systems.

Jonnah Bron's Photos of Couples Who Met During the Pandemic,"Noah and Noralie met in January at a youth climate conference in Switzerland. Three days later, Noah went to Nepal for six weeks. “While I was in Nepal, we spoke a lot,” says Noah. “When I got back to Schiphol [airport in Amsterdam], she was there to pick me up.”

With Noah in Utrecht and Noralie in Deventer, the couple live a train ride away from each other. The Dutch government has advised people to use public transport as little as possible, so the couple have tried to make the most of their dates. “Our first date lasted four days. Our second lasted two weeks,” Noah laughs. “When your social life is temporarily on pause, you can’t imagine what life outside of the pandemic would look like. But apparently we have a lot of mutual friends, so it’s turned out really well.”",,
Should You Get a Dog in Lockdown?,"It would be distasteful to declare a “winner” of the pandemic. But, gun to head, dogs have had it pretty good. Blissfully unaware of the reason their best friends are suddenly home all the time and eager to take them on long walks, pups are likely to catalogue 2020 as a Pretty Good Year. They’re also too busy tail-wagging to realise the price of puppies has doubled in the UK since 2019, while puppy scams have spiked globally.

If this is making you panic about puppies the way you did about toilet paper in April, please don’t. Just because you can get a dog, doesn’t mean you should. We spoke to new dog owners all over the world about how it’s been going, and whether adopting a four-legged friend was the right decision.

Hanna and her dog, Lulu – Melbourne, Australia

Lulu

For Hanna and her husband Dave, who share an apartment in inner-city Melbourne, miniature schnauzer Lulu has added some excitement to living through one of the world’s longest lockdowns.

“We had heard about puppy scams, where buyers were paying inflated prices for their puppies to secure their position on a waitlist, only to be later told that there was no puppy,” said Hanna. The pair managed to avoid getting conned, but collecting Lulu from Queensland – about 2,000 kilometres north of Melbourne – proved complicated.

“Unfortunately, because of COVID, the airlines stopped carrying puppies unless they were at least 12 weeks, and even then they were cancelling flights last minute. We ended up arranging for her to be driven down for AU$350 [€210].”

Current restrictions in Melbourne allow people two hours of outdoor time in the spring weather, but Lulu has been even more restricted.

“She’s still only 11 weeks old and is waiting for her final vaccinations before she’s allowed outside,” said Hanna, adding that the choice to take the plunge during lockdown was the right one. “The main perk is having the excitement and joy that comes with a puppy. She’s always ready to play, and incredibly affectionate.”

Emma and her dog, Archie – New York City, USA

Archie

“Right now, it feels like getting a puppy during lockdown was a big, big mistake,” says Emma of the rescue pup she adopted with her boyfriend in July.

Overrun with COVID cases in April, New York City was in a state of panic. It was around that time that Emma started researching dog breeds and shelters. “I’d grown up all my life with dogs, and found myself pining over puppies on Instagram or dogs on the street when quarantine started,” she says. By July, her and her boyfriend had Archie.

But welcoming the “Labrador and shepherd” mix (they have doubts about Archie’s actual breed) into their tiny, 45th-floor one-bedroom apartment with no balcony has proved a nightmare. “We figured having a furry companion would get us out of the house – a place that had become suffocating,” she said. What they didn’t expect was Archie’s aversion to loud noise. Living in the middle of New York City, it’s made going outside with him incredibly stressful. “All of a sudden, we are spending less time outside than we were before we got him,” says Emma.

On top of that, toilet training has been “next to impossible” in a high rise. “I cried almost every day for the first few weeks,” says Emma. The couple has discussed the idea of sending Archie back several times. “If we had our time again, we probably would have waited. Puppies are hard, and NYC is hard, and COVID is hard. But Archie is our son and we made a commitment to him.”

Emilie and her dog, Bowi – Amsterdam, Netherlands

Bowi

Amsterdam was experiencing one of Europe’s looser lockdowns when Emilie adopted her dog Bowi in May. “I was actually already thinking about getting a dog for a really long time,” she says. “During the beginning of the lockdown I had my brother's dog to stay for a few weeks, and I figured if I could fit that in my schedule, then why not just get my own?”

Adopted from a shelter in Portugal, Bowi was four months old when she arrived in Amsterdam. “She's a mix of so many different things, but shape-wise she looks like a dachshund,” says Emilie, who admits that while adopting Bowi has altogether been a big positive, training her has been a challenge. “It takes some structure, planning and discipline… but we're getting there.”

While she says taking Bowi to her office – where there’s an older dog she can learn from – has helped with the training, as of October, Amsterdam’s newly tightened restrictions mean Bowi and Emilie might have to spend winter together at home.

Victoria and her dog, Ozu – Grenada, Spain

Ozu

During their first stringent lockdown in March, dog walking was one of the few “essential outings” allowing Spaniards to leave the house. How did people respond? Well, some tried renting out their dogs to those willing to pay for fresh air, while others tried their luck leashing up a fake pooch and taking it for a drag.

Victoria’s motivations for getting a dog were more longstanding: “My boyfriend and I are always working, so we never decided to get a dog, because we didn’t have time to educate and raise him. During lockdown, we thought, ‘This is the best moment.’”

The couple got Ozu, a 40-day-old Labrador shepherd, in April. “The house is small, so it has been difficult to be locked in,” she says, noting that there have been no extra outdoor perks given that Ozu also wasn’t allowed to go outside before his three-month vaccinations. “The perks of having a dog in lockdown were being able to be with him so he wouldn't break things at home alone,” she says.

Tracey and her dog, Floyd – London, UK

Floyd

“Having a young puppy while in lockdown worked out amazingly well,” says Tracey of her whippet-Italian greyhound, Floyd. “My partner and I had actually planned to get a puppy irrespective of lockdown, but he was ready to be picked up just as London went into lockdown. We had to get him a week earlier – and the breeder was very uneasy – because of the lockdown on unnecessary travel.”

Tracey says they’ve been able to bond much quicker with Floyd than they would have had they both been working in offices full time: “I don’t know how we would’ve done it without being home so much. Basically, the puppy would have suffered more.”",,

72 Conservative MPs Have Still Not Attended Anti-Sexual Harassment Training,"Left: Jeremy Hunt (photo: Allstar Picture Library Ltd / Alamy Stock Photo) and right: Sajid Javid (photo: Cpuk / Alamy Stock Photo), neither of whom have booked to attend the anti-bullying and harassment course.

Seventy-eight MPs have still not attended a Parliamentary anti-bullying and harassment course, according to House of Commons records obtained by VICE News via Freedom of Information request.

The Valuing Everyone course was made available to all workers on the Parliamentary estate in 2018 after the 2017 “Pestminster” scandal involving several allegations of sexual misconduct against various MPs, including ministers. As a House of Commons spokesperson explained to VICE News, the training aims to “ensure everyone can recognise bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct and feels confident taking action to tackle and prevent it”.

And yet, according to data from the 30th of September – and confirmation from the House of Commons that the training hasn’t taken place on the 1st or 2nd of October – the session is yet to be attended by:

72 Conservative MPs

2 SNP MPs

2 DUP MPs

2 Labour MPs

As VICE News revealed in late August, as of the 22nd of July, the last day of Parliament’s summer term, 163 MPs – 140 of them Conservatives, including the Prime Minister and 15 Cabinet Members – hadn’t attended the training. By comparison, seven Labour MPs – including former leader Jeremy Corbyn – hadn’t attended.

At the time, VICE News approached the Cabinet Office for comment on the fact that more than half of the Cabinet – who’d committed to “protect people from physical attack or harassment whether for their sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion or disability” in their election-winning manifesto – hadn’t attended. In its response, the Cabinet Office said it would book every single Cabinet minister and the Prime Minister onto training sessions, several of which took place during the summer recess.

Soon enough, Boris Johnson - a man who, way back in 1996, wrote an article for The Telegraph assessing the “hot totty” at the Labour conference - attended the course. One news report suggested he found this training session “most informative”.

Today, of the 78 MPs who still haven’t attended, according to the FOI, 31 Conservatives, one SNP MP, one Labour MP and one DUP MP are on the waiting list for an upcoming session. This includes six Cabinet ministers: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps; Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden; Environment Secretary George Eustice; Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab; Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis; and Liz Truss, International Trade and Equalities Secretary and MP for South West Norfolk

But what of the other 44 MPs - 41 of them Tories, one SNP, one DUP, one Labour - who, the data states, aren’t yet booked to attend? Have they not felt encouraged by the knowledge that, if the Prime Minister has spared some time to do this, maybe they could too?

Little appears to have changed since the Pestminster scandal.

Until recently, one of their peers was Charlie Elphicke, the former Conservative MP who is now serving two years in jail for sexually assaulting two women, including a former employee. Another Tory MP (who cannot be named for legal reasons) was recently arrested on suspicion of rape, but has not yet had the whip withdrawn.

Mike Hill, a Labour MP, is under investigation following allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault (Hill has denied the allegations), while Rob Roberts, a Conservative MP, has admitted to inappropriate behaviour towards junior staffers. There’s also Labour’s Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, who was recently charged with one count of harassment (the case is ongoing).

Perhaps it’s just that the MPs who haven’t booked their place on this course simply agree with Mansfield MP Ben Bradley, whose distaste for the training was made clear when he recently explained, “It was two hours of jolly conversation with some colleagues that I liked very much. But to be honest, it was a total waste of all of our time.”

VICE News asked all the MPs who hadn’t yet attended or booked to attend this training as of this week: why not?

All MPs below are members of the Conservative Party, unless stated otherwise.

MPs who already told us they won’t attend and, true to their word, have not

Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire did not respond, so is presumably holding firm on his previous comment that “I don’t see it as a useful allocation of my time. No one’s ever left my employment since I’ve been an MP.”

Liam Fox, MP for North Somerset had not been aware of the training, a staffer previously told us, and has still not responded to requests for comment.

Sammy Wilson, DUP MP for East Antrim had previously asked us to “stop pestering my staff” and that all necessary information was available via FOI, so we did not pursue further comment.

MPs who did not want to comment

Gordon Henderson, MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey only speaks to local press.

MPs who were booked to attend, but no longer are

John Spellar, Labour MP for Warley did not respond to a request for comment.

MPs who want to attend but haven’t booked yet

Julia Lopez, MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, who previously told us: “I have not completed the training as I have only recently returned from maternity leave and the pre-recess slots had gone. I'll look out for the publication of autumn dates.”

Sir Christopher Chope, MP for Christchurch, who previously told us he was waiting to attend along with the rest of the Procedure Committee (who, it seems, have now all attended without him).

And Andrew Mitchell, MP for Sutton Coldfield, who has confirmed his intention to attend.

140 Tory MPs – Including Boris Johnson – Failed to Attend Anti-Sexual Harassment Training,"The Valuing Everyone sessions, delivered by training company Challenge Consultancy, is open to everyone working in Parliament. The House of Commons press office explains that it is designed to “ensure everyone can recognise bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct and feels confident taking action to tackle and prevent it”.

Exclusive FOI data obtained by VICE News reveals that 159 MPs – including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and 14 Cabinet ministers including Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick – have failed to attend the House of Commons’ anti-bullying and anti-sexual harassment training session.

More recently, Labour MP Mike Hill is being investigated by Parliament after accusations of sexual harassment and assault, Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards has apologised and been suspended from his party after being arrested on suspicion of assaulting his wife, Conservative MP Rob Roberts has admitted to inappropriate behaviour towards junior staff and an unnamed Tory MP has been arrested on suspicion of rape – and that’s just in 2020 so far. (Hill has denied these allegations.)

Little appears to have changed in the three years since the scandal. Ex-Tory MP Andrew Griffiths admitted to sending thousands of sexts to two constituents and former Labour-turned-Independent MP Jared O’Mara admitted to sexual harassing a junior member of staff.

Pestminster – as it became known – unfolded in Westminster when the #MeToo movement crossed the pond to the UK in 2017. MPs were outed for watching porn on their computers and asking staffers to buy sex toys. Ministers resigned. One politician – Charlie Elphicke, the former Conservative MP for Deal – clung on to his seat even after being charged for sexual assault. (He was convicted of two assaults in July after stepping down in December 2019.)

Anti-bullying and anti-sexual harassment training was introduced in 2018 as a direct response to the Pestminster scandal as part of a series of recommendations made as a result of Dame Laura Cox’s inquiry into bullying and harassment in Parliament, and was made mandatory for the entire new intake of MPs after the 2019 election.

Now, this doesn’t mean that all the above MPs have never tried to get onto the training. Liz Truss, the International Trade Secretary and Women and Equalities Minister, and Gareth Johnson, the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Foreign and Commonwealth office, were booked in but had to pull out due to ministerial commitments.

The 159 MPs who have not yet attended are made up of:

After VICE News approached the Cabinet Office for comment, all Cabinet ministers were promptly booked to attend, including Boris Johnson, who will now do so on 27th August.

Ironically, Dame Cox’s report decried a ‘‘we’re all much too busy’ approach to allocating sufficient time to training” and insisted that “training will be essential if the new [anti-harassment and anti-bullying] scheme is to work, and there has to be a commitment to training at the most senior levels”.

However, at the time of publication, 140 Conservative MPs had not taken part in the training – more than a third of the party’s numbers in Parliament. By contrast, only seven out of 202 Labour MPs have yet to attend a session.

In light of these stories, it would make sense for all MPs to spare, say, three paltry hours thinking about how to stamp out bullying and harassment in their workplace. After all, the 2019 Conservative manifesto did promise to “protect people from physical attack or harassment whether for their sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion or disability”.

Forty-seven out of the 159 MPs were scheduled to attend by March, but lockdown meant in-person sessions were cancelled. MPs have since been given an opportunity to re-book an online training session, the House of Commons tells VICE News, but these 47 politicians have not yet done this. They comprise:

45 Conservatives, including six Cabinet ministers (Alok Sharma, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Brandon Lewis, George Eustice, Grant Shapps and Oliver Dowden)

2 SNP MPs (John Nicolson and Pete Wishart)

Another 39 out of the 159 MPs had signed up to attend by 22nd July, when Parliament went into summer recess. These are made up of:

25 Conservatives, including one Cabinet minister (Gavin Williamson)

7 Labour MPs (Jeremy Corbyn, Ellie Reeves, Ian Mearns, John Spellar, Lucy Powell, Wayne David, Neil Coyle)

4 DUP MPs (Carla Lockhart, Jim Shannon, Gavin Robinson, Gregory Campbell)

2 SDLP MPs (Colum Eastwood, Claire Hanna)

1 SNP MP (Owen Thompson)

Finally, there are 71 MPs who were not booked in March or by 22nd July. They comprise:

68 Conservative MPs including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and six Cabinet ministers (Suella Braverman, Dominic Raab, Steve Barclay, Robert Buckland, Robert Jenrick, Ben Wallace)

1 SNP MP (Angus Brendan MacNeil)

1 DUP MP (Sammy Wilson)

1 Independent MP (Dr Julian Lewis)

This is what those 71 MPs had to say when VICE News approached them for comment and asked why they hadn’t signed up. All MPs in this list are Conservative unless otherwise stated.

MPs WHO ARE NOT GOING TO THE TRAINING AT ALL

Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire: “The training needs to be allocated, there needs to be a range of training from beginners to more experienced people and each have refreshers on employment law practices. I don’t think sitting for three hours [learning] about how to value people will make someone who doesn’t value people, value people. I don’t see it as a useful allocation of my time. No-one’s ever left my employment since I’ve been an MP.”

Liam Fox, MP for North Somerset: A staffer informed VICE News that the office was unaware of the training and he has not responded to requests for comment.

Sammy Wilson, DUP MP for East Antrim: “I would ask you to please stop pestering my staff with emails. All the information you require regarding the report you are interested is contained in the FCO [sic] response which you have obtained from the House of Commons.”

Nadhim Zahawi, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Industry and MP for Stratford-on-Avon: “I spent years building businesses outside of politics made up of great people who are motivated and well supported. I pride myself on doing the same with my parliamentary team and I know they would all confirm this.""

What Is 'Critical Race Theory'?,"Last week in Parliament, the government’s Minister for Equalities, Kemi Badenoch, spoke out against a dangerous ideology. One that is apparently on the lips of all politically-correct lefties, and teachers educating children about racism. Its name? Critical Race Theory (CRT).

According to Badenoch, CRT is “a dangerous trend” and an “ideology” of “victimhood”. “We do not want teachers to teach their white pupils about white privilege and inherited racial guilt,” Badenoch warned, announcing that “this government stands unequivocally against Critical Race Theory”, rousing supportive shouts of “here here” by her colleagues.

Even in the age of the never-ending culture wars, seeing a government minister stand up in the House of Commons and declare that the British state “stands unequivocally against” a particular philosophical approach was strange. Like finding some old parliamentary footage of William Gladstone shouting “this government stands against German Romanticism”, or Nye Bevan declaring “this government stands against Existentialism”.

The theory has become a talking point among right-wing culture warriors recently, with controversy-monger Laurence Fox making a video warning of its evils. But what is Critical Race Theory? And why has it provoked such a dramatic response from a British government that, in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, you might assume had more pressing matters to focus on?

Like many aspects of the UK’s current culture war, CRT is imported from the USA. The academic tradition that declared itself as Critical Race Theory emerged in the 1980s from that most dangerous of Marxist institutions, Harvard Law School.

CRT had important antecedents hailing from Caribbean and African colonial-era scholarship, but the figure often credited as the movement’s founder was the first Black Professor of Law at Harvard, Derrick Bell. Bell was a former civil rights attorney who had spent his early career on the front lines of the fight to overturn racial segregation laws across America.

How could he go on teaching central tenets of legal study, such as “the law is blind” or “everyone is held to the same standard of proof”, when reality suggested otherwise? To overturn material inequality would require more than just legal equality; there would also need to be an analysis of power, history and discourse.

In 1990, Bell put his principles into practice when he famously committed to taking unpaid leave from Harvard until his school overcame its failure to hire a single Black woman, an action that drew the support of the President of the Harvard Law Review at that time, one Barack Obama. Harvard refused to budge, bringing an end to Bell’s historic tenure there. Nevertheless, his academic approach was propelled forward by a conveyor belt of outstanding Black female legal scholars, including Patricia Williams, Cheryl Harris and Kimberlé Crenshaw, who is credited with having come up with the name Critical Race Theory.

Over the past few years, CRT has spread beyond the law school and even beyond the academy. But it still remains a relatively marginal social theory, especially in the UK. Even most academics who write on topics such as race, empire or migration in the UK would not define themselves as Critical Race Theorists, myself included. This is often because they maintain some intellectual critique of the CRT tradition – perhaps that is has been too America-focused, or that it has under-appreciated other factors, like political economy.

Any academic theory would expect this kind of criticism. What it wouldn’t expect is for a government minister to declare explicit opposition to it, or for that opposition to be cheered on by the same “free speech” outlets who just a few months ago were defending David Starkey’s right to argue that slavery wasn’t a genocide because “so many damn blacks” survived.

Online, there were some spineless explanations for this contradiction put forward, arguing that Badenoch was technically not banning CRT. Badenoch closed her attack by stating, “Let me be clear: any school that teaches these elements of Critical Race Theory as fact… is breaking the law.” Considering this was the state’s Minister for Equalities threatening legal consequences after just demonising the theory at length, it was hardly an invitation for teachers to bring the insights of CRT into the classroom alongside other ideas.",,

"Every Woman on Selling Sunset, Ranked From Evil to More Evil","When one of The Twins – bald, short, shirt crispier than a slab of Ryvita –tells the camera, “It may have our name on the door, but it’s all the kick-ass women who make this brokerage what it is”, he’s speaking only truth. Netflix’s Selling Sunset is a reality TV show about competition and hustle, Los Angeles real estate culture, the unsanctity of marriage and romantic relationships with age or money gaps. But above all of that, it’s about the women. It’s only ever about the women.

The very real world of Oppenheim Group Real Estate centres around a team of female real estate brokers who dress like everyone in LA dresses – like British students in the early 2010s but monied. Think tonged hair, bronzer, bodycon dresses with chunky waist-belts, fuchsia lipstick, diamond Circle of Life necklaces, cursive script tattoos of their own name. These women are millionaires in their own right, selling what my dad would call “music video pads” with infinity pools and basketball courts in the Hills. They are truly living, (fake) laughing and loving (in their own funny way).

In many ways, the Oppenheim Group is the most convincing case I’ve ever seen for making on-commission work illegal. By day, the women move from the office – a space where they pick apart each other’s failing relationships like vultures and give pieces-to-camera facing a string of blogger lights so forceful any features left on their faces are blown out, somehow both shiny and matte – to the properties. In these properties, they flirt outrageously with ugly tech bros called ‘Matthew’ and ‘Andrew’ and recite every last deeply specific fact about the house (the forest that each bit of flooring material was taken from, solar-panelled heating systems, the square foot of each annex and corridor). They will sell these properties if it kills them, without breaking a sweat or tripping in a stiletto. They will barter in innuendo and talk of “the bedroom” and raise a laminated eyebrow.

By night, in the dry Californian heat, they eat slithers of steak and send each other looks like needles as they swing wine glasses as big as their heads. I wouldn’t say there’s a cult energy to the business but there is the regular socialising with colleagues, which involves drinking a lot of Oppenheim branded wine at each other’s houses! Evenings and weekends! Very few if any outsiders! Also one of them dated the boss who still calls her the greatest woman on the planet and whose relationship only ended because he couldn’t commit! They bought a dog together months after they broke up! All good, healthy stuff.

You’d be forgiven for not knowing about this Netflix show. No one did until two months into lockdown, because it provided the two things many of us felt we would never have again, never attain at all: bitching sessions and house porn. The third season is out now and it’s so instantly mesmerising that you could dive right into that season with only the information I provide here. It’s everything TV commissioners have realised reality TV needs in 2020: both tacky glamour and genuine opulence, impenetrable smarm and deeply impenetrable foreheads… and relative evil. The only other thing you do need to know now is just how Much* these women are so I’ve ranked them to 0 to 100. Here come the girls…

*It’s necessary to luxuriate in this show to accept that no one here is a “good” person. No one needs to be “good”. It’s LA, bitch.

Maya of 'Selling Sunset' (Netflix)

MAYA – 5 percent evil

New mum of the bunch, I would let her have my kids. Looks like a cross between Giselle Bündchen and Gwyneth Paltrow. Honest hard-working woman who made a mood board for her marriage and doesn’t talk shit about anyone – yet you know she conceives of herself as above the others. Emotionally disconnected from the whole industry. She is the very rare case of Girlboss gone right: quite literally has it all, meticulously presented, with precisely the right amount of botox.

Amanza of 'Selling Sunset'. (Netflix)

AMANZA – 0 percent evil, 99 percent chaos

An icon of a single mom. A massive laugh, who, like all enormous legends, doesn’t take work anywhere near as seriously as she should. She does seem to fall over in heels a lot and turn up to viewings an hour late. The only other one besides Maya I can imagine engaging with outside of paying for their hitman services.

Sweet baby Chrishell of 'Selling Sunset' (Netflix)

CHRISHELL – ? percent evil

There’s no doubt that Chrishell is the American Dream writ large. Grafting and grafting, she came from poverty and no doubt endured a lot of pain to live the LA lifestyle and impress The Twins. She’s a bonafide sweetheart but as she lasts into S3, further than we thought she might, the toxic environment is sure to corrupt her more profoundly than anyone else. Know her by her baby voice.

Heather of 'Selling Sunset' (Netflix)

HEATHER – 20 percent evil

Heather could feasibly be any rich white woman from The Hills, Laguna Beach or any of the Real Housewives franchise. Between the blonde hair, LV weekend bags and black cowboy hats, it’s difficult to know what to make of her. Sly moves to come? It can’t be ruled out.

ROMAIN – 25 percent evil

Mary’s French child bride. On the brink of smirking at all times. In a way, Romain is both the most relatable and decent of them all – his irritability and obvious disconnection in group setting is a rational response to spending any time around these women. It’s also very normal for a heterosexual European bloke in his mid-20s to not want to plan an overblown wedding.

Mary of 'Selling Sunset' (Netflix)

MARY – Mary percent evil

Little Mary. She’s been married twice and is now engaged to someone with slightly differing life goals: she wants kids while her biological clock allows, he envisions potentially having kids when she’s menopausal. Very good at her job. Nice hair and sick car.

Davina of 'Selling Sunset' (Netflix)

DAVINA – 35 percent evil

Into her forties, Davina is the oldest of the bunch. Not “mean” necessarily but she did tell a woman her engagement ring is crap because it wasn’t made of diamonds. Tends to turn up wearing a pussybow blouse and an air of darkness.

Christine, Queen of 'Selling Sunset' (Netflix)

CHRISTINE – 100 percent evil

Christine is an evil Barbie with a river of hair that men drown in, never to be seen again; the alter-ego Taylor Swift thinks she did with Reputation. Ten skill points for her terrifying memory (in the pilot, she remembers one brief meeting with the new girl, Chrishell, unbeknownst to her, on a night out years ago). Fifteen skill points for her hazing abilities, which she enacts, drunk on Cristal and/or bloodlust, on any person who has ever-so-slightly pissed her off. Thirty for her lines, the best in the show – one example: when she goes to Mary’s house and is served a lipstick marked wine glass, she says, “I feel like I’m in a Cheesecake Factory”. Are you serious? Knock me out as you swing your arse-length ponytail like it’s a medieval flail, Christine.",,
"'Move Over Britney, I'm Coming to Vegas' – Gemma Collins Talks Life Onscreen and Beyond","The stylists brushing blusher on her face and curling her hair laugh, but it’s a fair point – just not one most people would make. While other former Celebrity Big Brother contestants might have smiled in a tight-lipped sort of way, and offered some platitudes about how “it’s the taking part that counts,” the woman known as The GC would never dream of underselling herself. She doubles down instead, growing even more incredulous: “I came out to boos, it’s really weird. I do not get how I was the biggest thing on the show but I didn’t win.”

When I arrive in a taxi on a rainy Tuesday, a white Land Rover has pulled up in front of me. The door opens, and suddenly there is Gemma Collins – a person whose sunglasses-covered face , captioned with the words “Can you just please be quiet? Have a bit of respect,” I share with my friends every time I am even a bit pissed off – just standing in front of me, in a silver two-piece from her own clothing collection. We’ll be formally introduced later – when Collins is sat in the glam chair, bringing the validity of the entire Celebrity Big Brother voting process into question (“I think it was a fix,” she concludes) – but for now, the first thing I hear her say, as she turns to one of the publicity managers present on the day’s shoot, is this:

To discuss the new series and its place in Collins’ growing TV legacy, as well as to ask what’s next for the woman who has done everything (including ITV’s short-lived celebrity diving competition Splash!), I’ve come to Hutton Hall, a high-end wedding venue in her native of Essex, which has the pillowed-velvet feel of a 3D model of Mrs Hinch’s Instagram grid, and where the toilets are about five hundred times nicer than my actual flat.

It’s this online fame which skyrocketed Collins’ already ascendant star to the very highest reaches of reality TV fame in the UK: her own show. What began as a one off (2018’s Diva España, which followed her attempt to launch her clothing brand in her beloved Marbella) quickly became Diva Forever, a full blown series for ITVBe, in 2019. Since then, fans have been graced with Diva on Lockdown – a three-parter consisting mostly of footage from cameras installed in Collins’ home during the coronavirus lockdown– while the newest part of the Diva saga, Diva Forever and Ever, debuts on ITVBe on the 13th of October.

Such is the planet-scale confidence of Gemma Clare Collins, reality stalwart, megawatt TV personality and, lately, internet sensation. Though she may have come sixth when she left the Big Brother house in 2016, there’s a very strong argument for The GC having been the show’s real winner. In the years since her eviction, her CBB appearance has become the stuff of legend, granted immortality through its transformation into a number of widely shared memes: her off-the-cuff outbursts, somehow always better timed than most scripted comedy (“I’m claustrophobic Darren” – pure music!), now part of the lexicon of a generation.

She is pleased, however, that Diva on Lockdown allowed fans to see a bit more of her Gemma side. “I think people do love to see a bit more of me normal, because I do have the same dilemmas as everyone else, and I think people just find it really relatable.”

Collins, of course, has two personalities, and during our conversation she oscillates between them both for effect. There’s Gemma, who happily loads the dishwasher, and the über-diva GC – a sort of Sasha Fierce for people whose ideal Saturday night consists of a pitcher of Cheeky V (guilty as charged) – who wouldn’t dare. “The GC is a character, and she’s hilarious,” Collins says, promising that she’ll be out in force in Diva Forever and Ever, and assuring me that the upcoming series is her best yet. “Because I was fresh out of lockdown, raring to go,” she explains. “I’d had a good rest. I suppose it’s like a racehorse really. You have to rest them and then get them back running.”

“Course!” Collins laughs. “Pre-GC. Once the make-up goes in, I’ll be the crazy GC. What’s good about my reality show is that you get to see quite a lot of me more normal. I still put my own washing in, hun. It’s not all glamour.”

On her 30th birthday, however, everything changed. Producers had asked the original cast of TOWIE if they knew any interesting characters in the area, and Amy Childs’ mum pointed them in Collins’ direction. “I’d fractured my coccyx at the time and I had to have two weeks off work,” she thinks back. “I got the call and they were like, ‘Right, come to TOWIE.’ I thought it was a joke; I thought it was my mates messing me about. I was like ‘I’ve got a fractured coccyx, I do not need pranking right now.’ And literally, I put the phone down and this girl called me back, and she went, ‘This isn’t a joke, please don’t put the phone down, we wanna see you.’ And I was like, ‘shit.’ So I started whacking down the diazepam so I was able to get out the pain and go for the interview.”

The tale began when Collins was initially cast on TOWIE for a few weeks. At the time, she was a hotshot car saleswoman on a BMW forecourt: “I used to try and sell three cars a day because I knew that would keep the boss happy, and I could go and get a blow dry,” she explains matter-of-factly. “They used to call me The Hattrick Collins, because I’d do one at nine, one at 12, one at like, three. I was like ‘Listen, I’ve done the cars for today, can I go?’”

Collins’ relatability is her greatest asset, as is obvious from her social media success (she currently has 2 million Instagram followers, while the @gemmareacts meme page, whose content she frequently shares, has 160k) – though it was first proven during her tenure on The Only Way Is Essex , from 2011 to 2019. Remembering the early days of TOWIE, she says, “When I went on the show I probably didn’t quite fit the mould. But of course, there’s so many people out there like me, who wanted to watch the show but thought, ‘It’s all full of skinny, beautiful girls.’ But I think I changed that, then everyone fell in love with me, and that’s it. I lived to tell the tale.""

If Masterchef wasn’t quite to her taste, I’m interested to know which of the shows she’s taken part in was her favourite. She mulls it over for a minute – “I’ve done loads of shows. You forget. I’ve done ‘em all,” she says. There was Dancing on Ice, which she enjoyed because it taught her endurance and helped her grow, but it wasn’t the best. That accolade, surprisingly, goes to Who’s Doing the Dishes – a short-lived ITV dinner party game show, filmed in celebrities’ homes. It ran from 2014 to 2016, and was hosted by former Westlife member Brian McFadden (with whom Collins was actually later reunited on Dancing on Ice in 2019). Telling me about it, Collins gets a glint in her eye.

Since making a significant impact on TOWIE, Collins has taken TV by the scruff of the neck, gracing every reality show under the sun – from I’m a Celebrity… to Celebs Go Dating – with her inimitable part-Del Boy, part-Barbara Windsor presence. I ask her about her experiences of one of my personal favourites, Celebrity Masterchef, and she recalls it with gusto. “Couldn’t stand that if I’m being honest. Because I had to peel 50 potatoes. Now don’t get me wrong darling, if it’s a Sunday and I’ve got all the family over pre-COVID, I might have peeled them. Well, no, I wouldn’t have. I’m lying.” Once again, she’s got the room laughing. “But 50 potatoes is a lot of potatoes to peel. I think on the average roast dinner you might do one bag of potatoes. I had to peel 50, I thought it was a joke. I was like, ‘Are you sure?’”

“I was a huge Westlife fan. Brian McFadden was my favourite because he was always the naughty one in the band,” she says. “When they called me and said ‘Do you wanna do Do the Dishes?’ I was like, ‘I ain’t doing the dishes.’ And then they said, ‘Well Brian McFadden’s doing it.’ And then I was like, ‘I’m definitely doing the dishes then.’ Otherwise, I just would have been like, ‘Nah’ – a bit GC about it.” Remembering her day with McFadden, she smiles serenely and says simply: “I’ve gotta say, he sat on my sofa, he ate a KFC bucket, and it was the best day of my life.”

Gemma Collins knows she is funny – she tells me so herself – and one of the best things about interviewing her is the sense that you’re in the orbit of a pro. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who is better at being interviewed – or indeed, better at being a celebrity – than Collins. She’s a star in the old showbiz sense – the type of warm talent who works a room and holds a sing-song at the end. Sipping tea from a little cup with a saucer, her curls pinned in place ready for photos, eyelashes out to her nose, she delivers quotable line after quotable line, fully aware that they’re her currency. After almost a decade in the industry, she has total mastery over her persona, and what people want from it. “I’ve got an ability to make people feel really good, even if I feel shit myself,” she says. “That is the skill, that’s entertainment, do you know what I mean?” Even in front of our small assembled audience of management, makeup artists and hairdressers, everyone is eating out of the palm of her perfectly manicured hand.",,
"What Is Mutual Aid, and How Can It Help With Coronavirus?","More than any crisis in recent memory, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted deep structural problems that prevent our government from properly handling a public health emergency.

Rather than waiting for the government to fix things, people have created Google Docs and Forms to organize mutual aid efforts across the country. There’s a mutual aid coordinator Slack channel. Even New York House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has encouraged people to get involved, co-hosting a webinar on mutual aid on Wednesday evening with prison abolition activist Mariame Kaba.

“COVID-19 is just pulling back the curtain on how unbelievably flawed our political and social structures are, and our economic system, not to mention our healthcare system,” Kendall Mayhew, an organizer with Ground Game Los Angeles, which is organizing a mutual aid system, told Motherboard. “We’re only as safe as the person who has the least among us, so we have to pull together to lift everybody up, and that means systemic change.”

But what is mutual aid, and why do so many people turn to its methods in times of crisis? We spoke to some of the people on the ground—college students, organizers, parents—about how individuals and community organizations are creating online mutual aid systems to make up for the lack of governmental support. Of course, we shouldn't have to be doing this. But as we acknowledge the structural failures of our systems, standing in solidarity with one another is one way to compensate for how screwed up everything is—and hopefully, save lives.

What is mutual aid?

In systems of mutual aid, communities take on the responsibility for caring for one another, rather than forcing individuals to fend for themselves.

Mutual aid is also not charity: rather than creating a centralized organization where one person is giving to someone else, forcing them to become dependent on yet another relationship negotiating their access to material resources, mutual aid creates a symbiotic relationship, where all people offer material goods or assistance to one another. Mutual aid organizing is volunteer-run, transparent, and driven by the needs articulated by community members.

Mutual aid as a principle is attributed to Russian anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin, who defined the term in his 1902 missive Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution:

“[M]an is appealed to to be guided in his acts, not merely by love […] but by the perception of his oneness with each human being. In the practice of mutual aid, which we can retrace to the earliest beginnings of evolution, we thus find the positive and undoubted origin of our ethical conceptions; and we can affirm that in the ethical progress of man, mutual support not mutual struggle — has had the leading part.”

Mutual aid played an important role during community organizing in the sixties and seventies. Some famous examples include the Black Panther Party’s Breakfast Program, which provided free meals to kids in impoverished urban areas, and the 1970 takeover of a Bronx hospital by New York City’s Young Lords Party. More recently, activists with Occupy Sandy organized direct relief to victims of Hurricane Sandy after the superstorm made landfall in 2012. Thousands of volunteers provided necessary goods that were otherwise unavailable because of shuttered stores and damaged infrastructure, like bottled water and food, and set up community hubs where those in need of help could seek resources and support.

What are people offering?

Neerja Garikipati, a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, is a member of several on-campus organizations, but hadn’t been involved directly with mutual aid work until this past week. They noticed online mutual aid efforts cropping up at other universities and colleges across the country.

“[At University of Pittsburgh] there are a lot of first generation, low income students, a lot of students of color and students in the LGBTQ community, who I knew when this happened” would be disproportionately impacted, says Garikipati. They reached out to their personal network of student members of on-campus organizations, and suggested they begin preparing for the university's shutdown by copying other schools’ mutual aid plans.

Immediately, Garikipati heard back from about 15 students, and since then the number of involved students has more than doubled. They’ve built out a resource sheet to help people offer and receive aid. Many campuses, including University of Pittsburgh, have closed and pushed out students from the dorms, leading to students being stranded—some far from home and without resources to travel. Garikipati says the main requests have been for temporary housing for those who cannot make it home, storage for their belongings that they were unable to transport, funds to support them getting back to their homes, or getting material resources like prescriptions or groceries.

Motherboard spoke to one member of a mutual aid network in New Hampshire who helped create a local rapid response spreadsheet, and who asked to remain anonymous, fearing police retaliation against himself and other mutual aid organizers. In the months before the COVID-19 outbreak, he and other volunteers were on the streets in the city of Manchester distributing products like toothbrushes, toothpaste, and Narcan to the city’s homeless and those struggling with addictions. As the coronavirus pandemic hits the state, their biggest challenge has been accessing their usual resources.

“What we need people to understand is that it is direct outreach and mutual aid that is going to keep you safe,” the organizer said. “The best way to not get this virus is to make sure that people around you don’t get it, and that they’re taken care of if they do. That means the opposite of hoarding.”

While the organizer’s fellow volunteers are taking the necessary precautions to keep each other safe, such as reduced volunteer hours and keeping their spaces especially clean, he said it is essential for aid workers to continue helping these vulnerable populations.

“People will literally die if we don’t do this outreach, so we need to do it, and we’re going to just do it in the most practical and safe way possible,” he said.

In Los Angeles, Ground Game modeled its organizing after a similar effort in Seattle, which was hit earlier in the pandemic; it later helped organizers in D.C. and northern Nevada set up online forms and coordinate.

“People are just offering their experience and being really generous and spreading the knowledge, and that’s all based in mutual aid principles,” Kendall Mayhew, the Ground Game LA organizer, said.

The group’s form, which is in both English and Spanish and currently being translated into several other languages, hopes to accommodate different types of requests for Los Angeles residents in need. Ground Game has simultaneously raised over $40,000 to distribute to those seeking financial assistance. Mayhew said the main requests have been for things like groceries and hygienic supplies, as well as monetary support.

Taking it offline

While having access to the internet has been a useful support system for organizers struggling with self-isolation and social distancing, it’s an imperfect solution to a long-term problem.

On Tuesday night, Facebook began marking posts about the coronavirus as spam, causing concern from users that mutual aid groups were being targeted. After our interview, Kendall from L.A. sent me screenshots of members of her organization having mutual aid-related posts marked as spam. According to Facebook, a bug in their software was marking coronavirus-related posts as spam, and because they had sent home their content moderators due to the coronavirus, there was no one to clarify the issue or verify the posts at the time.

“Technology has a limit,” said the mutual aid organizer from New Hampshire. “People struggling with houselessness, the elderly, children, are not going to hop on a Google spreadsheet and fill in their needs and their phone number and address and all that stuff. It’s not going to happen.”

Mayhew noticed the same thing. “A lot of us are really connected digitally, but in the US, 25 percent of [rural] households don’t have broadband.” Overall, 8 percent of Americans lack access to broadband, according to the FEC. “It’s obviously a lot more pressing in rural communities, but even in L.A. we have a lot of people who don’t have internet in their own home, or elders in our community that don’t know how to interact with these things.”

The organizer from New Hampshire added that this is tied into the greater history of mutual aid. “People who do mutual aid and direct outreach, and have been doing it for a long time, are extremely used to operating in a hostile environment,” he said. “Even before the rise of the internet, existing institutions have always been hostile to mutual aid,” he said, noting that there are laws in many areas of the country that prohibit people from giving food or money to the homeless. “We see that the policing of individual behavior is really focused on trying to make people dependent on institutions, rather than dependent on each other, so going forward what we need to be doing is thinking creatively.”

All three of the organizers that spoke to Motherboard were hopeful that this desperate moment would lead to a longer-term vision for interconnectedness—and more people acknowledging the failings of our political system.",,
Opportunists Are Preying on Instacart Shoppers as Bots Ramp Up on the Platform,"Opportunists are trying to find ways to extract money from Instacart shoppers, some of whom are increasingly desperate for work during the coronavirus pandemic. In one case, a middleman asks Instacart workers for thousands of dollars with the dubious promise that they are able to change a shopper's account in Instacart's backend to let them work at specific stores, providing more reliable work.

The news signals increasing competition among Instacart shoppers, who in recent weeks say that they have seen their chances to work dry up as the platform has been flooded with hundreds of thousands of new shoppers. The battle for work has also become fierce due to multiple people developing bots that give some drivers the ability to scoop up delivery jobs faster than people who aren't using automated tools. Now other people are trying to potentially scam shoppers with more schemes.

""I'm skeptical if he's actually legitimate or just scamming shoppers for money in hopes for some secret access to batches,"" an Instacart shopper and administrator of an Instacart shopper Facebook group who first alerted Motherboard to the scheme said. Motherboard granted the admin anonymity to protect them from retaliation from Instacart.

Do you have internal documents from Instacart, have access to an Instacart bot, or know about other schemes on the platform? We'd love to hear from you. You can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, OTR chat on jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.

Instacart has two general types of shopper on its platform. The first, ""full-service shoppers,"" make up the majority of the Instacart workforce; they receive orders on their app, drive to the store that has the items, find the items, purchase them, and deliver them to the customer, using their own vehicle and paying for any expenses related to that. The other type of shoppers are ""in-store shoppers,"" (ISS) who are paid hourly, and only work inside a particular store picking up items, meaning they don't have the expenses of buying gas or maintaining their vehicle. In-store shoppers are officially employees of Instacart, while full-service shoppers are gig workers who are classified as independent contractors. For that reason, some workers may be more attracted to the in-store shopper position, or at least might think that it will provide them with more predictable work as new people sign up to be full-service shoppers.

In this scheme, a middleman says they know an insider at Instacart who will change a shopper's account to that of an in-store shopper, for a fee.

""All I do is message my friend at IC [Instacart],"" the middleman wrote in a text message to the admin. ""He changes your status. No third party apps. Can't get kicked off. Nobody I know of in almost a year has been kicked off.""

In the text messages with the admin, the middleman asked which specific store the admin wanted to be an in-store shopper at.

""Every morning, you go in and pick the orders you want. Kroger for example, you shouldn't have any orders less than $60 ever. You can pick 5 at a time,"" the middleman continued, adding that becoming a shopper at Costco is also possible. The middleman said the price of their service was between $500 and $2000 depending on the store.

An Instacart internal support associate, which is a position at the company which deals with issues around workers, told Motherboard ""ISS shoppers only work at one location in general."" Motherboard granted the person anonymity as they weren't authorized to speak to the media.

There is no indication that the middleman actually has access to an Instacart insider. Because in-store shoppers are technically employees rather than independent contractors, becoming one would theoretically require more administrative tasks and paperwork than a simple checkbox change on an account.

""The safety and security of the entire Instacart community is our top priority. We have several robust security measures in place to ensure the security of the Instacart platform. Selling or purchasing batches is not an authorized use of the Instacart platform and is a violation of our Terms of Service,"" an Instacart spokesperson told Motherboard in an emailed statement. ""Anyone found to be engaged in any type of inappropriate or fraudulent use of the Instacart platform, including selling or purchasing batches or utilizing any of these types of services will have their accounts immediately deactivated. We advise shoppers not to engage with any individual or company that claims to provide priority access to batches or other unique access to the platform, particularly those that request sensitive information such as Instacart usernames, passwords and/or credit card information,"" the statement added.

Over the past few weeks Motherboard has spoken to several Instacart shoppers who feel the platform is not doing enough to police the presence of bots and other automated tools which aim to grab batches of work before another human shopper manages to.

""Amazon has had people using similar software for years, and it's still ongoing. Meaning a company at the level of Amazon hasn't even put a stop to it,"" the admin said. ""It makes me think that Instacart just really doesn't care whatsoever.""

In March Instacart gig workers held a huge nationwide strike to protest against the company not providing them with basic protective equipment and or paid-leave for those with preexisting health conditions.",,
Instacart Sends Cease-and-Desist to Website That Automatically Placed Orders,"The developer of a website that claimed to automatically hunt for free delivery slots on Instacart and complete a user's order for them shut down the site Thursday after getting a cease-and-desist order from Instacart.

This tool, called Cartdash, and others like it Motherboard previously found for Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods, highlighted a divide between those who happened to know about the tools or the tech-savvy to leverage them, over those who just had to keep trying to use delivery apps as normal to in an attempt to secure food during a pandemic. Instacart, Amazon Fresh, and Whole Foods use a “delivery slot” system to schedule an order, and during the pandemic these slots have been taken quickly, meaning that people who want to get groceries delivered may have to wait days or even weeks to order.

""It's an incomplete system, but I have the essentials to start,"" Devon Koch, the developer of Cartdash, told Motherboard in an online chat. Koch later told Motherboard he shut down the tool in response to Instacart's cease and desist letter.

Do you have internal documents from bot makers or sellers? We'd love to hear from you. You can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, OTR chat on jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.

Before it closed, to use Cartdash users first selected what items they want from Instacart as normal. Once that was done, they had to provide Cartdash with their Instacart email address, password, mobile number, tip amount, and whether they prefer the first available delivery slot or are more flexible. The tool then checked that their login credentials were correct, logged in, and refreshed the checkout page over and over again until a new delivery window appeared. It then placed the order, Koch explained.

""I don’t store any user data, so as soon as the order is submitted, all of the users data is wiped from my server,"" Koch said, although he does take screenshots of the page if there is an error for his own debugging purposes and to inform the user. Once the process is complete, he also deletes those screenshots, he added.

When asked if this tool may give people an unfair advantage over those who don't use the tool, Koch said, ""at this point, it's a matter of awareness, not technical ability, since people who can use Instacart can use Cartdash."" When pushed on how, realistically, not every user of Instacart is going to know about Cartdash, even after it may receive more attention, and the people using Cartdash will still have an advantage over people who aren't using automated tools, Koch again said, ""it's a matter of awareness, not technical ability.""

Other developers Motherboard previously spoke to who created tools to automate finding delivery slots for Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods saw the room for abuse, although some of their tools were harder to use on a technical level than Cartdash.

""Yes, it's an unfair advantage over others who aren't tech-savvy but may still need to purchase items urgently. However, I try my best to reduce the abused [sic] problem,"" Manfong, the developer behind a Chrome extension that notifies users when a delivery slot opens up, told Motherboard in an email.

Koch said he would have liked to devise a system that incentivized both at-risk Instacart users, such as people with pre-existing health conditions or the elderly, as well as the shoppers themselves. One example could have been to ensure that a tip is guaranteed to be 30 to 40 percent at a minimum while using the tool.

""You know what… I just checked my email. Got a cease and desist from Instacart.""

When asked for comment on Wednesday, Instacart told Motherboard that independent services like Cartdash are in no way affiliated with the company, and that people claiming to be able to grab delivery slots outside of the main Instacart platform are, at a minimum, violating Instacart's trademarks but also as the company's terms of service. Instacart said people who do this will be contacted by the company's legal team.

On Thursday Motherboard asked Koch whether he had faced any sort of legal issue from Instacart due to CartDash. At the time, Koch said he had not.

But as the conversation continued, Koch said, ""You know what… I just checked my email. Got a cease and desist from Instacart.""

""Damn, this is all happening in real time,"" he added.

Koch said he checked Instacart's terms of service before creating CartDash and ""there wasn't anything in there that stuck out.""

Instacart's terms of service says, ""You may only access the Services through the interfaces that Instacart provides.""",,

How to Fit in a Real Workout When You Have Only 20 Minutes,"Now we have a pretty cool newborn, and I was cleared to exercise a few weeks ago. There’s also, you may have heard, a pandemic, so my little family is stuck indoors and trying to do childcare plus work plus staying sane.

I started lifting a couple of years ago and roped my husband into being my gym partner. We did the math and realized it made sense to get a squat rack for our basement rather than paying for two gym memberships.

Hey Casey. Thanks for writing this column, it has helped me get into powerlifting, which in turn has helped change my relationship with exercise. Yay!

But don’t put too much pressure on yourself, because you’re busy with a ding-dang baby!!! Or, for others who are reading this who are not busy with babies: You’re busy with school, you’re busy with your new job, you’re busy with your divorce. A time of great stress, whether it’s good stress or bad stress, is not the time to set the expectation that you’re not only going to survive but also set a PR while you’re doing it. I forbid it; let this particular kind of self torture go.

I think I would let go of the idea of making big progress, for now. With some patience you might be able to get pretty close to where you were before, which is probably pretty strong.

I love to go through a major life transition, such as starting a new job or going back to school, and treat it as a fresh start for all aspects of my life, to start doing everything perfectly. While this is an impulse I think we all have, it could not be more backwards: If you are trying to make a big change, trying to do everything all at once will only set you up for sort-of failure at everything . Big-change time is when you should feel okay scaling other stuff back, and figure out how to add it in in a sustainable way down the line. This especially applies to working out, as it’s important for our health but doesn’t have a natural fit in most people’s lives or schedules.

So my question is: how do I put together a powerlifting routine every day for 20ish minutes? I like the idea of handing the baby off, banging out some squats, and calling it a day, I am just having trouble figuring out how to do that while still making progress. I imagine some kind of upper/lower body split, but any attempt at googling that leads to VERY intense six day programs and I am not about that life. I just want to figure out how to do enough so that I feel strong and get some endorphins in the process. —Claudia

We are feeling pretty lucky to be healthy and also to have access to a fancy set-up for lifting. As the main food source, I’ve found it very difficult to string together enough time to get in a full workout. Back in my halcyon gym days I was going three times a week and doing at least three compound lifts (e.g squats, bench, deadlifts), which took at least an hour or more.

Mark Zuckerberg’s sister takes a slightly more aggressive line here with her “pick three” rule : “Work. Sleep. Family. Friends. Fitness. Pick Three.” But I often see this rule separated from Zuckerberg’s follow-up clarification: “I can pick a different three tomorrow, and a different three the following day. But today, I can only pick three. As long as I wind up picking everything over the long run, then I’m balancing my imbalance.”

This is not to say don’t work out and also blame yourself for your choice to have a baby. You always deserve “me” time and to balance that with everyone else’s demands on you. But I don’t want to confuse that with it being ok to have priorities in the short term that temporarily interfere with your ability to juggle all the plates.

I’d do this when I could have instead recognized that feeling for what it was and tried to find a more harmonious solution in the long term, instead of “trying to do everything at once” or “neglecting ‘important’ demands in favor of doing something because I want to do it” or “accepting that the situation I’m in is me experiencing the effects of my choices, and there will be opportunity to make more and different choices in the future.”

I know this is hard because the idea of letting something as laden with cultural baggage as “a baby” or even “work” govern our lives to the degree that we have to give up things we are passionate about can make us feel trapped. I’ve been known to—how to put this in a way that is gentle to myself—significantly disrupt, undermine, or annihilate more structured elements of my life at very inconvenient times simply because I felt they impinged on my general sense of agency.

Usually I think we try to keep these rests as short as possible, but that’s mainly for expedience and maybe a little for not getting too cold and stiff. But if you’re moving around doing something else because something came up when you finished your last set that you had to take care of, that is less of an issue.

I think one reason we don’t automatically think of this is that we have a lot of superstition related to working out in general about maintaining a certain heart rate (sometimes in order to stay in a mythical “fat-burning zone” ), but frankly, this is not worth worrying about when it comes to lifting. If you were doing steady-state cardio, things might be different, but lifting is already filled with breaks anyway in the form of rests between sets.

An option it doesn’t seem like you’ve considered, but could really work for you given that you’re working out at home, is allowing yourself long breaks during your workout. I don’t think there is incredible established science about “how long” you can sort of interrupt a physical activity section and not experience any negative effects, but I know I’ve been interrupted before for 20 minutes or half an hour during lifting and then gone back to it.

Do you have a question about working out, eating, health, or why you shouldn't be afraid of lifting heavy weights? Send it to swole.woman@vice.com and follow @swolewoman on Instagram.

Taking 20 minutes to work out every day is enough to keep you in good health. It almost certainly won’t be enough to return to the point of “making strength progress.” And that’s okay!

I wouldn’t recommend this if you’re going for a max attempt on a deadlift. But if you’re just taking a break between your squat sets and your bench sets, I think you’d be more than fine; maybe just quickly warm up again if you feel like you’ve cooled off.

This may amount to really making an evening of a gym session, and maybe you just can’t afford to dedicate all the time even if it’s broken up. But if the specific issue you’re having is “continuous time,” I think it’s worth giving non-continuous time a try, if all you need is substantial breaks here and there to take care things.

If you really, truly can’t get more than 20 minutes at a time and can ONLY get 20 minutes, that can happen sometimes when your life is undergoing a lot of changes, and it might be a while until your routine settles down to the point you feel like you can get working out back into the mix. This can happen with any big change, These are not the times to be super hard on yourself about hitting all the marks of peak health optimization; while working out should, on average, be a part of your life, it’s not going to kill you to not do it for a few months while you get more important things in order.

Now for more brass tacks: The way you phrase your question makes me think of Jim Wendler’s “I’m Not Doing Jack Shit” version of his 5/3/1 program (he affiliates with Nazis sometimes, but made a good program). To quote from his book:

“This is my favorite. I don’t recommend it, but it’s useful for non-beginners who have limited time to train. The I’m Not Doing Jack Shit program entails walking into the weight room, doing the big lift for the day (bench, squat, military or deadlift), and then walking out… I’ve made this deal with myself many times before I’ve trained: If I do X weight for X amount of reps, I’m leaving.”

The idea here is that when life gets in the way, mentally, physically, emotionally, you can strip down a heavy-lifting program to the bare bones and still get to do the big compound lifts, get in your reps and kind of stay where you’re at, progress-wise, but also not feel tied to an involved program that can stretch out for hours. This could be done whether you have heavy weights at home or not. Wendler goes on to say that this is not any kind of permanent solution, but if it’s to your preference and fits your limitations, it’s an option:

“The disadvantages here are obviously the lack of both volume and balance, but it can work for a while. If I had very little time to train, I’d do this. Sometimes, when you’re struggling to find time to train, you think you can’t make progress. With this type of training, you will.”

Really, what you’re doing here is “cutting all accessories.” I will say when I’ve done this, it’s an option I personally really like, because I like the feeling of heavy lifting. In the same amount of time, I could instead do, let’s say, sets of 12 body-weight step-ups per leg for 3 sets (72 reps, for those keeping track) in an at-home workout, no heavy weights necessary. That’s an option for everyone who has 20 minutes and only 20 minutes. But I have discovered in recent months that that format of working out makes me very annoyed and angry. If you did one big lift each day—squat one day, bench one day, deadlift one day, pull-ups another day, overhead press another day—you could probably get that in in 20 minutes.

The next option is one of the six-day-a-week programs you mention, which are usually formatted as “push-pull-legs” (pushing exercises like squatting or benching one day; pulling exercises like deadlifts or rows the next day; “leg” exercises like Romanian deadlifts the next day; repeat for 4-6 days per week). You are right that these programs are usually a lot of volume, or a lot of sets and reps. I think in the scenario you’re presenting, I would try cutting one of these programs down to a couple of the main compound movements (squat, bench, deadlift, rows, pull-ups, overhead press) each day, so like, squat/bench on push day, pull-ups/rows on pull day, deadlift/squat accessory on leg day.

A nice thing about only having 20 minutes is it’s almost impossible for you to overcomplicate this. Keep in mind that lifting programs are deliberately designed to help balance the development of your overall fitness (well, the good ones, at least), so I wouldn’t fuck around too long with going off the beaten path of that structure. But a few months should be more than fine, and allow you to start trying to bend toward carving out more time for this part of your life.

The other option is to just do whatever high-volume stuff you feel like; sets of 6-15 reps, as many as you can reasonably squeeze in without hurting yourself, whether you want to bench and then just do some curls, or deadlift and then do some glute bridges. I take no responsibility for the results of this approach, good or bad, but it could also be a nice time to let go of really aggressive structure and follow your heart, heavy-lifting-wise, and let your me time really be me time.

Rising from the Ashes of Rentboy Comes a New Community for Male Sex Workers,"It was about 6 a.m. on Tuesday, August 25, 2015, and Jeffrey Hurant was awakened to the sound of his doorbell ringing. Groggy, he dragged himself out of bed, went downstairs, and opened the door, where he came face-to-face with four Department of Homeland Security agents hoisting battering rams, outfitted in tactical gear.

This article appears in VICE Magazine's Algorithms issue , which investigates the rules that govern our society, and what happens when they're broken.

Baum watched while every hard drive, computer, and phone was confiscated and six of his co-workers were shackled and whisked away. Agents seized 836 terabytes of data from Hurant’s home and Rentboy’s office that day, the equivalent of 1,600 laptops worth of data, Hurant said.

Meanwhile, in another part of New York City, TT Baum, the brand manager of Rentboy’s massage site, ManWorks.com, and about a dozen other Rentboy employees were working in the company's corporate office when DHS agents unlocked the front door and ransacked the place, Hurant and Baum said. Rentboy had existed for 18 years when DHS raided it, and there was nothing secretive about the site. Everyone knew that Rentboy served to connect mostly cis male male escorts to their clients, even though no financial transactions were made on the site. If there was any question whether escorts were selling sex, Rentboy’s yearly Hookies awards laid them to rest. Airing on Showtime, the male-escort Oscars featured awards for Best Porn Star Escort, Best Cock, and Best Bottom.

They stomped into Hurant’s house, moving from room to room seizing computers, flash drives, Kindles—anything they could find that could possibly contain the data they were looking for. Hurant—who was the CEO of Rentboy, a website for men seeking male escorts—watched as every electronic device he owned was hauled away. None of the agents would tell him why this was happening. After letting him get dressed, they cuffed him and placed him in a van.

The courses were a part of their non-profit arm, HookOnline, which included a website that provided advice on how to safely interact with clients and deal with police, and a place for live chatting with experts about topics like the Affordable Care Act. There were also forums for escorts to communicate with each other and share knowledge about clients.

At the time of its shuttering, about 3,000 men were placing ads on Rentboy, and they didn’t just use the site for advertising. Many also took part in the free workshops held around the country by Rentboy’s educational arm, Rentu, that taught escorts about everything from HIV prevention to how to correctly file taxes. As an incentive, if escorts attended a class, they would receive two weeks of free advertising on Rentboy.

The feds never fully explained why they targeted Rentboy . After all, it was one of dozens of escort websites that existed online. Even the New York Times editorial board rose to Hurant’s defense. “The criminal complaint is so saturated with sexually explicit details, it’s hard not to interpret it as an indictment of gay men as being sexually promiscuous,” they wrote . But reasoning aside, when DHS took down Rentboy, they didn’t just destroy a male escort website: they destroyed a network that helped keep thousands of male sex workers safe.

Inside the freezing cold lockup, the six men and one woman were arraigned and charged with promoting prostitution. They each faced five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Hurant’s bail was the highest, at $350,000. His father put his house up as collateral. After nearly eight hours in lockup, they were released.

“And then I was like, ‘Oh, that's what's happening,’” Hurant recalled. “I didn't expect it to happen. I mean this kind of advertising had been going on for years… When I started, it was in the back of every magazine. New York magazine had escort ads in it.”

Hurant rode in the DHS van through New York City until it stopped at an ad agency on 23rd street between 9th and 10th, he said. After the agents led him inside, Hurant realized the ad agency was a cover for a secret DHS office. They fingerprinted him, collected DNA samples, and took pictures before taking him to a federal courthouse lockup in Brooklyn. When he got inside, he saw six guys from Rentboy there.

But was their visibility what made them a target, as opposed to multiple other forums where men sold sex? Rob Yaeger, an escort who advertised on Rentboy from 2010 to 2015, thinks so. The Hookies were “an open and obvious celebration of sex work,” Yaeger said. “In hindsight, though, perhaps that openness led to the raid: Here was a sparkling LGBTQ event that celebrated what technically could be considered a crime.”

Presenting male escorts not as victims or as debaucherous, but as people with dignity who were doing important work, was a radical notion. Female sex workers and their allies have been making the argument that sex work is a form of labor that deserves dignity and respect for decades. Rentboy’s clients were nearly all queer men, and the site was a profitable and politically active part of the gay community. Rentboy donated to HIV/AIDS groups, provided a scholarship fund for its escorts, and even created a #LoveWhatIDo section of their webpage with beautiful headshots of escorts accompanied by interviews.

“We were always working to reduce the stigma and increase the pride that people had in the fact that they were doing a job that was noble and it helped people,” Hurant said. “I feel like we did everything we could to make sure that we taught survival skills and that people were thriving.”

When Hurant founded Rentboy in 1997, male escorts, particularly gay male escorts, were generally a reviled group, portrayed on film as murderers (The Living End), thieves (Midnight Cowboy), or drug addicts (Less Than Zero). Rarely, if ever, is the profession shown in a positive light in popular media ( 2017’s Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood is a notable exception). Rentboy was a rebuke to these images.

While Baum didn’t face charges, he did lose his job, which he’d had for around three years. He continued to work as, per his description, a sacred intimate and erotic healer, which involves things like erotic body work sessions. But the loss of his job and of Rentboy hit him hard. He’d been a sex worker activist for years before he worked at Rentboy, and was drawn to the company's social justice bent. After Rentboy was destroyed, “I took a break from activism because I was feeling burnt out,” Baum said. “As you might imagine, having your company be hated by the federal government took a little bit of a toll on my mental health.”

Charges ended up being dropped against the six of the seven Rentboy employees, and only Hurant was left facing prison time. He wanted to plead not guilty, but his lawyers advised against it. Hurant said it would have cost around $750,000 to defend himself against the government if the case had gone to trial, with no guarantee of a victory. So, like 90 percent of federal defendants , Hurant pled guilty. The judge assigned to his case, Margo J. Brodie, was sympathetic to him, and sentenced him to six months in federal prison, less than half the mandatory sentence. In court she said of Rentboy , “The very thing that was illegal, it also did a lot of good.”

“Rentboy was a much better platform in basically every way: It was easier to navigate and the quality of the clients was considerably better,” Yaeger said. “The mere fact that Rentboy did have community outreach and offered social programs differentiates it from what we have now, which is basically nothing. “

Three days after the closing of Rentboy, many of the thousands of male escorts moved their profiles to Hurant’s competitor, Rentmen, which is based in Hamburg, Germany, and therefore not subject to U.S. laws. Although similar in name, Rentmen lacked most of everything that made Rentboy a safe haven for escorts: the classes, the community and the sense of dignity bestowed upon escorts.

Nearly four years passed, and in early 2019, Baum was frustrated that, in his eyes, nothing had come to take Rentboy’s place. “What we had had in 2015 as far as resources and best practices and feeling the ability to call each other out when we saw people doing stuff that was endangering not just themselves, but the rest of the community, that had all disappeared,” Baum said. Due to the restrictions imposed by SESTA/FOSTA, an anti-sex trafficking law implemented in 2018 that holds websites responsible for what their users post, it was nearly impossible to create a website like Rentboy.

On August 16, 2017, as the escort business carried on without him, Hurant was booked at a medium-security federal correctional institution in upstate New York (he also had to pay a $7,500 fine). He worked in the boiler room at the prison, handwriting his memoir against the backdrop of the hissing of steam, eating Thai noodles that his friend would skillfully prepare in the microwave.

“Rentboy disillusioned a lot of male and masculine-of-center sex workers,” Baum explained. They didn’t want to create a new community because they saw the threats of prison, he thinks. “Unlike female sex workers who live with the threat of violence and incarceration all the time, that's not necessarily a part of our day-to-day experience as male sex workers.” Research on male sex workers is lacking, but some research shows that male sex workers get assaulted by clients at lower rates than female sex workers . Around 80 percent of prostitution arrests in the United States are of women. But what happened to Rentboy made male sex workers realize on a visceral level that arrest was a very real possibility.

These weren’t the only barriers: the focus group members also didn’t think they should be asking for help. There’s an “idea that we have a perceived safety or privilege or untouchability as cis-male and transmasculine providers that really isn’t there,” one attendee said. “And it kind of perpetuates that ‘every man for himself’ is the better road to go down.” The focus group members recognized that many male escorts are more privileged than female escorts—they are targeted by law enforcement much less frequently than female escorts are and are subjected to less violence—and they wanted to figure out a way to acknowledge their privilege.

By convening focus groups with male sex workers, the pair discovered that after the Rentboy raid, men—including former members of the site—had tried to enter activist groups, but found themselves not welcomed. ""There’s a perceived notion that, because the work is different, that we can’t offer anything constructive in those circles,” one told them. The culture of male and female sex workers is different, some focus group members argued. While female sex workers usually check their clients’ references before taking them on, male escorts do not. “If I asked that, I’d get laughed at,” one said.

“As far as we know, we’re the first org that specifically focused on transmasculine sex workers as part of our mission”

By this time, Baum, a cis white man, was ready to talk about recreating what the feds had destroyed. So in March of 2019, he tweeted out a call, asking if there were others who might want to join him at the Woodhull Sexual Freedom Summit, a yearly conference for sex researchers, educators and sex industry workers, in a discussion about how to organize male sex workers. “I do!” a New Orleans-based sex worker activist named Shaan Lashun, who is a Black trans man, tweeted back.

“As far as we know, we’re the first org that specifically focused on transmasculine sex workers as part of our mission,” Lashun said. “This demographic of sex workers is extremely underserved. There's a lot of misinformation that transmasculine folks don't do sex work at all.”

They ended up having such a positive response that Baum and Lashun decided to start a new organization just for masculine-of-center sex workers, particularly trans men.

“There were several folks from the femme-of-center community who came in with good intentions, like, ‘We want to help, What do you need?” Baum said. “And when our answer was, we don't even know what we need yet because our community has been kind of decimated…that was shocking to a lot of folks in the room.”

At the beginning of the presentation, the focus on men confused the audience, who mistakenly thought the panel was about sex-worker clients. (Even among some sex workers, the idea that sex workers are women and clients are men persists).

On August 16, 2019, in a 728-square foot conference room in an Alexandria, Virginia, Hilton Hotel, Baum and Lashun stood in front of about 30 attendees at the Woodhull Sexual Freedom Summit. Their talk was entitled “The Challenges of Male Provider Mobilization,” and its intent was to ask how male sex workers could become “an added voice” in the sex work community “without capitalizing on male privilege.” Both were really nervous, wondering if the larger sex worker community would be hostile to a male-focused panel.

In spite of SESTA/FOSTA (or perhaps because of it) Lashun and Baum launched the Molly House Project in November 2019, naming it after the 18th and 19th century British term for taverns or public houses that served as meeting places for homosexual men. “Molly Houses were this safe place for us to be ourselves back in the day,” Baum said. “We want to create a safe space for you to be able to talk openly about what your experiences as a masculine-of-center sex worker.”

They were stymied, however, by SESTA/FOSTA. Many websites and classifieds where sex workers posted ads shut down out of fear of prosecution, including Craigslist’s personal ads and CityVibe. The Department of Justice used the law to shut down CityXGuide. The law was supposed to prevent sex trafficking, which there is no evidence it has done. There is evidence that it has made sex work less safe, however. According to a 2020 survey of 136 sex workers by Danielle Blunt and Ariel Wolf of the sex worker led collective Hacking//Hustling, one third of sex workers had experienced an increase in violence from clients since the passage of SESTA/FOSTA and 99 percent of respondents said the law “did not make them feel safer.” Sex trafficking and pimping markedly increased in San Francisco in 2018 ; nationwide, pimps began targeting sex workers as well. Police had trouble tracking down human traffickers because the websites traffickers used were no longer in operation. And research shows that when Craigslist created erotic classifieds sections in the early 2000s, the female homicide rate dropped considerably.

They attempted to recreate in some ways what Rentboy had provided: a space for discussions among sex workers about safety and best practices. Their Twitter account and newsletter have served to warn members of the community about the dangers of using Rentmen’s chat feature to talk to clients because it isn’t encrypted and the company’s terms of service say “that they will hand over any relevant data to law enforcement during investigations.”

SWOP became their financial sponsor, handling donations, taxes, and insurance, and serving as the parent non-profit. (Officially, Molly House is a “project” of SWOP.) Some money came from a donation PornHub gave to SWOP, and individuals contributed as well. “Honestly, we haven't been as successful as other fundraisers I've seen and part of me knows it is because of who our demographic is, and the perception of the lack of need or the perception of automatic privilege…because [we’re] men or masculine,” Lashun said.

The organization was going to be primarily virtual: monthly Zoom calls, live Twitter chats, newsletters, and a compilation of resources. The pair first reached out to the Sex Workers Outreach Project (SWOP) for support. “They pitched this idea to me that there was this huge gap in online community for masculine-of-center sex workers,” said Christa Daring, the inaugural executive director of Sex Workers Outreach Project. “I'm trans myself and tend to be on a masculine-of-center spectrum, so it's close to me as a person, wanting to make sure [there’s a space] for transmasculine sex workers who sometimes don't really fit into either world.”

They began recruiting members on Grindr, setting up a page for their organization, but nobody joined. So they switched to another tactic, relying on their own networks of people to get members, and began to organize in-person meet-ups in cities in late 2019.

Still, SESTA/FOSTA prevents MHP from doing too much. “Anything that could be construed as enabling prostitution is liable under SESTA/FOSTA,” said Daring. “If we say that we are helping somebody do sex work in a safer way or giving them advice”—that could be enough to get them in trouble.

“If we're caught organizing in a way that makes us safer, in a way that we share resources, in a way that we educate each other, we are automatically, in the eyes of the federal government, trafficking each other.”

The pandemic hitting in March 2020 ended MHP’s in-person meetings, but it led to a wave of interest and memberships after MHP set up a COVID-19 relief fund for male and masculine-of-center sex workers. Within four days, 70 people applied for funds, and within a week they had to stop applications because they’d run out.

Creating a fund for sex workers who are men or masculine-of-center is highly unusual in the sex work community, and it caused tensions to flare. In spite of being clear about who the funds were for, they still got a lot of trans women applying. “There's just difficulty in communicating that not everything that says trans is for trans women,” Lashun said. “We've gotten a lot of pushback. They're like, ‘Oh, well, you don't care about the girls. And what about us?’ To which we respond: Here's a link of seven specific funds for trans women only. This one over here, this is for us.”

MHP continues to hold monthly virtual meetings focused on timely issues. In June, they hosted a #blacksexworkersmatter meeting, and last month they invited FTM porn star Dick Dopamine, where they discussed Disclosure, the new Netflix documentary about how transgender people have been portrayed in the media.

Later this year, MHP plans to create “an online forum that exists outside of the meeting space, where we can gather and share resources and ideas,” Baum said. “We're also working on beefing up the website, so there's a resources page for people around the country. Like, if you have physical need of something that you can't get through Molly House, we can at least point you in the right direction to have access wherever you are in the world.”

“In an ideal world [MHP] would be a rebirth of HookU,” Lashun said. But even making a video instructing sex workers on how to best set their rates could led to serious legal consequences. ""Under the current law, we become traffickers,” Baum replied. “If we're caught organizing in a way that makes us safer, in a way that we share resources, in a way that we educate each other, we are automatically, in the eyes of the federal government, trafficking each other.”

While MHP continues to find its footing, Hurant has laid low since his release from prison in February 2018. Although he got off probation early last year, he hasn’t spoken to the press until now.

“Even talking about this, I realized how PTSD I am about it,” Hurant said. “It’s like somebody who's been abused in some way. You know, like, I just feel like I've been told to shut up so much about this, and I've gone through so much pain for it.” Hurant doesn’t have any plans to re-enter the escort business, but he says that he misses Rentboy every day. “My job wasn't about keeping suffering in the world. It was about multiplying joy,” he said. “I don't see how society is any better off now.”",,
When Is the Artist Assistant Just the Artist?,"When Andy Warhol introduced his New York studio in the early 1960s, it was a concrete, exigent manifestation of how art production would change forever. Aptly named “the Factory,” the hub introduced Warhol’s groundbreaking assembly-line approach to creating visual work—a business model that ultimately tied his name to creating art on a massive scale—which artists continue to reference today. In delegating much—if not all—of his artistic production to assistants, he gave birth to a new normal: the artist could call a work of art his own, even if he didn’t have a single part in its execution.

For many in the visual art world, Jeff Koons is one of the first people who come to mind that fulfill this archetype. One of the richest, most well-known visual artists of our time, Koons is famous for his kitsch metal sculptures in the form of balloon animals. A 10-foot version sold for $58.4 million in 2013—at the time, the most expensive piece of art ever sold at an auction by a living artist. He’s also extremely open about his own factory-style way of working. Nathaniel Kahn’s 2018 documentary, The Price of Everything, illustrates this in unmistakable detail: in the film’s first few minutes, the camera follows the charismatic artist through his NYC studio, stopping to observe a studio assistant re-creating a Giotto painting for Koons’ Gazing Ball series. From the brushstrokes to the reflective blue sphere, Koons openly acknowledges that almost no part of these paintings was made by him. But when the works sell for several millions of dollars, his name will be the only one associated with the art—and he will be the primary holder of those profits.

As a practice, artists employing assistants to create work isn’t novel. Even in the 16th century, Michelangelo hired assistants to paint the Sistine Chapel, and Rembrandt was known to sign paintings completed by his assistants, passing them off as his own. But after Warhol normalized a hands-off approach to creating art, using assistants to create work at unprecedented scale and speed, studio assistants became widely accepted, if not expected. Across industries like photography and painting, we’re seeing more and more artists acting like creative directors—overseeing the work while still claiming it as their own.

“As a photographer, you want to be focused on shooting. You don’t want to be distracted. We’re the extra eyes, brains, and hands, so [Ryan] doesn’t have to worry about that,” she explained. “And for big shoots, it’s impossible. The photographer can’t be setting up stands, lights, and screens. If the light looked weird, the photographer would have to put his camera down, get up, try some stuff, sit back down, pick up the camera, try it again. That’s wasting precious time that clients are paying for.”

In the studio, assistants are expected to create work that solely follows Koons’ direction—they replicate his process and his techniques. In practice, Koons’ assistants don’t function much differently from the more familiar scenario of photo assistants on set during a shoot, working almost as extensions of the head photographer. Christine Ting, a photographer who worked for two years as an intern and assistant to Ryan McGinley after moving to New York in 2017, feels that assistants are an integral part of production, especially as shoots increase in size and scale.

Koons and his department heads developed a stenciling process in-house so that the assistants can come in and stencil a painting for him—almost like filling in dots with coordinated colors on a palette. “Andy Warhol did a similar process when he had the Factory… where anyone can jump into the line and be able to do it,” Logan De La Cruz, a painter and longtime assistant to Koons, told VICE in March. Growing up in inner-city Miami, De La Cruz began working at Koons’ studio as a stenciler in 2015 for the Gazing Ball series to pursue his dream of joining the New York art scene, and he’s been there ever since.

But at its core, the art world has long relied on a foundation of workers who make a fraction of what these high-end artists make from selling a single piece. And when artists like Koons or McGinley have pieces selling in the tens of thousands to millions, it feels pertinent to ask: Does it make sense that a single individual receives the credit even when they don’t—or can’t—make the work themselves? Is it time to reevaluate what it means to be an artist assistant and where ownership of art in collaborative processes begins and ends?

Size and scale play obvious roles in how many helping hands are involved in production, but the breakneck speed at which art is both digested and sold today has many artists relying on means outside of their own skill set to execute their work. Sometimes, as in the case of famous iPhone photographers, technology lets you skip learning the actual craft; other times, great assistants bridge that gap.

Aside from the era of Warhol’s Factory, another crucial moment in art history changed that: Marcel Duchamp’s introduction of “readymades,” such as his porcelain urinal titled Fountain. Exhibited in 1917, the radical piece forced critics to broaden their perception of what could be called art.

While this debate seems rooted in contemporary art, it has actually gone on for centuries. As Wade Saunders wrote in Making Art, Making Artists, published in 1993: “Students in 19th-century ateliers learned, in part, by assisting; Rodin spent several years in Carrier Belleuse’s studio… Julio González worked for Pablo Picasso… Jackson Pollock for Thomas Hart Benton.” Despite the prevalence of assistants in Renaissance studios, certain telltale facts—like the debated value of a Rembrandt created by his own hand vs. his assistants’—showed that assistants were never truly accepted.

But when taking into account the differences in income between these assistants and the people who hire them—on Glassdoor, for instance, the wage for a Koons Studio Assistant is listed as $21 an hour—the lines in that process get a bit more blurred again. While De La Cruz is happy at his job, he’s also aware that it’s not a high-paying one, and notes that the pay disparity between owners and executors exists across all sectors: “It’s another product of a supposed ‘free market economy.’”

De La Cruz added: “I think art—and this can be kind of cringeworthy for some people—but art today is a business. And like any business, you have your CEO, your president, and your department heads, etc. We don’t all come to this plane with all the tools we need to manifest our dreams, right? So being able to acknowledge that you could use this person’s help to create this vision, I don’t think that minimizes your involvement or devalues the work.”

“It’s the photographer’s responsibility to hire the right people to get what they want. You don’t necessarily need to be versed on every single light [mode] or technology to be a good photographer. People hire you because you create beautiful images. If you can get the right team together to make that happen, then awesome. If you fuck it up because you decide to try and figure it out yourself, that’s on you, right?” Ting said.

Although there are still those who disagree, many in the art world now rarely consider well-known artists as less than an artist because they lack skill. As long as they’re able to acknowledge that weakness—and find ways around it—they still reach the same result. And at the end of the day, that’s what counts.

Macau native Crystal Chan worked briefly in Murakami’s Kaikai Kiki New York City studio after graduating from the School of Visual Arts in 2018. Her schedule started promptly at 8 a.m.—the team began every day with a Japanese stretching exercise—and often ended around midnight, a day filled with silk screening and color mixing. Chan doesn’t miss the long hours but still felt she learned a lot through the experience. “I think he’s the first successful artist that’s able to combine his art with his philosophy and theory, but at the same time approach a commercial [landscape]. That experience was so helpful to understand how things work. It made me feel like, OK, I want to be him. Not in the same approach maybe, but I want to be able to make my work speak to a broader audience.”

Murakami modeled the factory after Japanese animation and manga studios—a business model he felt was effective at organizing mass production while still teaching students valuable skills. Many artists Murakami takes under his wing end up working at Kaikai Kiki, and people have often complimented the factory’s collaborative and intentional, albeit strict, culture.

It’s arguably the artists who transform assistant gigs into multifaceted learning opportunities that create the best work environments. In fact, some artists actually make these hubs with the purpose of giving emerging artists a platform while employing them to do work. The Japanese visual artist Takashi Murakami, famous for his bright cartoon-like imagery and signature multicolored flowers with faces, founded what would evolve into the Kaikai Kiki factory in 1996 with that purpose—using it as both a production house and artist management company.

“In 2001, there were plentiful editorial photo assisting jobs, and I was paid $200 to $250 per day. Now there are very few editorial shoots and I either get asked to use no assistant or to pay the assistant $150. The big difference is that now there are digital techs who own a bunch of gear and can charge good rates, $500 to $1,500 per day. If you have a very regular relationship with people, there are other ways to make more money, like retouching or gear rental,” McGregor said. Since 2005, he’s run his own successful independent practice and personal studio and has repeatedly encountered the need to remain agile in the dynamic photography landscape.

When Mike McGregor first started working for the acclaimed portrait photographer Platon in 2001, he saw it as a pivotal stepping stone to break into the New York photo scene. McGregor’s business and tech skills—acquired through extra classes as he earned his BFA in photography from Montana State University—set him apart from other assistants and helped him get into Platon’s studio. But in the last few years, technology has rapidly changed the editorial photography landscape: The cost of entry is lower (you don’t need $40,000 worth of resources to get started, the amount of money Mike invested in equipment when he first began working in NYC). Magazine budgets are a fraction of what they were in the 2000s. And thanks to YouTube tutorials and iPhones, practically anyone can become a photographer in no time—further impacting an already competitive industry.

Assisting used to be perceived as a rite of passage: You started out working and learning from an established artist before learning the skills you need to make it big yourself. Now, with technology and social media, it’s possible to build your own skills, connections, and following on your own. Many artists still rely on assisting to make connections, and as a dependable source of income—but that may also be rapidly changing.

“In today’s day and age, you’re pretty hard-pressed to find a skill set that only one person can do. The one thing you bring to the table as an artist now is your ability to interact with humans and to pull something out of another human. That personal interaction is the one unique skill set that isn’t readily transferable,” McGregor said.

Lopez, who prides himself on his collaborative abilities, also feels that interpersonal candor was a huge part of working as an assistant. “My relationship with Nadia is a little different than the relationships I have with other photographers. Nadia’s more of a director—prior to the shoot, she’ll ask me to send her references in terms of lighting or camera choice. I generally like to think of myself as an optimistic and friendly person—when I hire an assistant, I’m looking for someone who also has those qualities. You want someone who you can get along with because you have to hang out with them for so long.”

“The majority of people, they don’t know enough to know whether [this art is] good or not. But if the media says it’s good, people will like it. I would definitely love to see more diversity, that people don’t focus on one big artist. People that like Murakami don’t even know why—it’s like brands: Why does everyone want to wear certain brands?” Chan said.

At the end of the day, many assistants are grateful for their gigs—but they’re also grateful for the line between their work and the artists they work for. Chan, for instance, creates personal, interrogative work around her femininity and her feeling of displacement in migration—a sharp contrast to Murakami’s distinctly Japanese, gender-agnostic creations. After college, Lopez felt inspired to share visual stories about his family’s Mexican roots, steering far from the commercial, product-marketing photography he often assists for. De La Cruz frequently works on pieces that mix high and low-brow art, a product of his tough upbringing—and a far cry from Koons’ high-end-market works.

“Jeff’s work is Jeff’s work. It’s not necessarily something I need to be credited on. I’m being paid to help create his vision, and that’s where I leave it. I don’t feel any grudge for not being credited there,” De La Cruz said. “That’s Jeff’s vision, and it would feel weird to be credited for his vision in any way. I have my own visions, and I want them to be solely mine. And credited to me."" (1)

1. At the time of these interviews, many of the sources I spoke with were directly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak due to their crafts’ need for close social interaction. Ting, a portrait photographer living in New York, was unable to continue her practice. Lopez’s photo assisting gigs in LA had temporarily halted, and he described missing the collaborative environment of being on set with others. McGregor hasn’t done a shoot since lockdown began. For others, getting away helped offer a respite from quarantine. De La Cruz has spent more time painting, and with his partner, in upstate New York. And Chan even debated leaving New York to return to Macau to be with her family. In the meantime, it seems like visual art is being put on hold, and many artists who rely on assisting for income will be facing financial difficulty.",,
More and More Companies Are Covering the Cost of Egg Freezing. But Who Is It Really For?,"On a clear, unusually warm weeknight in March, more than 140 women joined a Zoom meeting. The occasion was not a virtual happy hour, fitness class, or any other pillar of daily life that’s shifted online during the spread of COVID-19 —in fact, the women weren’t there to discuss the world’s strange new normal at all. Instead, they showed up to dive into a totally different health topic: freezing their eggs.

As recently as a decade ago, this part of Sasan’s presentation wouldn’t have happened at all, much less during a global pandemic as an economic recession looms . It wasn’t until 2014 that companies began offering the benefit, starting with Facebook and Apple . Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in particular brought the topic to the forefront by advocating that her company subsidize the cost of the procedure for employees—who included healthy, fertile young women who wanted to freeze their eggs to delay having kids, a practice also known as social egg freezing .

Sasan closed her presentation with the following: “We know that there are a lot of employers that are starting to add benefits for their employees, and one of those benefits is starting to be egg freezing,” she said, her smiling face aglow against a backdrop of dark windows. “[Or] maybe you work somewhere where you don’t have any [fertility] benefits. We actually have a designated team of people that can help champion that cause for you and your coworkers. We’ve had patients come to us and say, ‘You know, I really wish my job would cover this.’ We can navigate that for you.”

Titled “Virtual Fertility 101,” the meeting was an online version of a fertility seminar held by Kindbody , a woman-led healthcare startup that offers, among other services, egg freezing and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Over the course of an hour, Fahimeh Sasan , a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and the company’s founding physician, gave a rundown of egg freezing with Kindbody—what’s involved physically, logistically, and financially.

In a 2018 essay for Girlboss , the former Facebook product manager Bo Ren argued that this combination of corporate paternalism and implicit societal pressure was why she opted not to freeze her eggs at age 28 while working for the company: “The hiring marketplace in tech has become highly competitive, and to reel in top talent, companies have taken to piling on the signing ‘perks,’” she wrote. “The downside to all the shiny extras? It’s huge. More and more of our personal decisions and life planning choices are being unwittingly shaped by the paternalistic systems that supposedly are in place for our benefit.” (Plus, as Ren pointed out, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG] and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine [ASRM] don’t yet endorse the use of egg freezing “for the sole purpose of circumventing reproductive aging in healthy women.”)

But just as the policy had its champions, it also had critics, who argued that it encouraged women—particularly healthy women—to delay having children in favor of staying tethered to their jobs 24/7. Or, in other words, the overt message was one of reproductive autonomy, but implicitly, the signal was lean in—and do it sans children.

Suddenly, at Facebook, the major factor prohibiting women from freezing their eggs—the exorbitant cost —was no longer a barrier. Over the next few years, several of Facebook’s peers, including Google, followed suit and added the benefit. By 2017, egg freezing was considered the hot new perk in Silicon Valley .

In a 2015 interview with Bloomberg Television , Sandberg explained her rationale: “There’s a young woman working at Facebook who had got cancer,” she said, “and I knew her and she came to me and said, ‘I’m going to go through the treatment, and that means I won’t be able to have children unless I can freeze my eggs, and I can’t afford it, but our medical care doesn’t cover it.’ I talked about it with our head of HR, and said, ‘God, we should cover this.’ And then we looked at each other and said, ‘Why would we only cover this for women with cancer, why wouldn’t we cover this more broadly?’”

This explosion of fertility-benefits companies means another thing: that more and more employers are starting to cover egg freezing. In that first wave, five years ago, it was mainly finance and tech companies in Silicon Valley. Today, startups, media companies, and universities across the country are adding it, too. VICE and Uber offer it through Progyny . Carrot Fertility has nearly 100 employer partners , including Slack, Foursquare, and Stitch Fix. Kindbody, one of the fastest-growing providers of the benefit, currently partners with 19 U.S. companies, including the telemedicine platform GoodRx and the media companies BuzzFeed, Complex, and The Skimm. Last December, Kindbody secured an additional $10 million from Google Ventures to sell its services directly to U.S. employers, bringing the total amount raised to $32 million.

The egg freezing benefit also raises deeper questions about race and class inequality when it comes to fertility care . The cost of egg freezing and IVF is prohibitively high—which, according to a recent study , makes infertility treatments “impractical, if not impossible, for many couples, especially low-income families.” Plus, when examining barriers to women receiving care, this study found that an “inability to pay for infertility treatment” was a concern expressed by minority women. Because the benefit affects employees at largely white-collar companies—who tend to be highly educated, higher-income, and predominantly white—the policy would help alleviate the financial burden for those who are already at an advantage .

Kindbody is not Bartasi’s first fertility rodeo, so to speak. A graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill and Harvard Business School, Bartasi began her career in publishing, founding an Atlanta-based business magazine before launching FertilityAuthority.com, an online resource and social network for those struggling with fertility issues, in 2008. In 2015, Bartasi led a merger between her company and Auxogyn, a biotech company, to launch Progyny—which, last year, became the first fertility benefits startup to go public .

Early in March, I met with the founder and CEO of Kindbody, Gina Bartasi, at the company’s New York flagship clinic, which opened in Manhattan in September 2019. We sat in an upstairs nook overlooking the lobby—which, with cool-toned wood floors, low beige couches, perky succulents, and Easter egg–yellow accent pillows, looked more like a West Elm than a doctor’s office . While waiting downstairs, I thumbed through a coffee-table book titled Work Wife: The Power of Female Friendship to Drive Successful Businesses. The company’s slogan, Own Your Future, hung in black cursive lettering on the white wall behind my back.

However, this sum doesn’t include one vital part of the equation—the fertility drugs. Where those are concerned, employers have two choices: run the specialty fertility drug benefit through their major medical plan and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), or, alternatively, carve the fertility drugs out of that plan and have the benefit administered directly through Kindbody. (According to Kindbody, the latter choice saves employers an average of 20 percent of the cost of the drugs.)

For example, Kindbody offers a single egg freezing cycle to employers for $5,300 ; elsewhere, that cost can range anywhere from $6,000 to $20,000 . This figure is a bundled rate that includes the appointments and blood draws involved with the cycle, the retrieval procedure, and storage for the first year; from there, each additional year of storage is $500.

Bartasi’s note to self prompted her to take a risk that, so far, has paid off. By eliminating any type of middleman—insurers like Aetna, Cigna, or even Progyny—Kindbody says it can afford to offer these services at a lower price, including to employers have to shell out fees to brokers who sell insurance plans .

But why found another fertility company three years later? “It didn’t dawn on me until five years ago,” said Bartasi, who is both brisk and upbeat. “Literally, [I was] sitting in front of an employer, and they’re like, ‘Well, you’re an insurance company—you sit between us and the doctors.’ I’m like, ‘Wow! Right. I’m an insurance company.’ They’re like, ‘We don’t want to buy from an insurance company… We want to buy from the doctors.’ And I’m like, ‘ Oh, OK.” She snapped her fingers and cocked her head, her chestnut-brown hair swishing to one side. “Note to self.”

In addition, although the average age of the egg freezing patient at Kindbody is 33—near the beginning of the age range when women’s fertility begins to decrease gradually, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists —Bartasi has seen interest from women as young as their mid-20s. “You better believe it,” she said. “These women are smart today. It’s like the next generation just gets smarter than the previous generation… When you talk to patients who are in their mid- to late 30s, they say, ‘Why didn’t people tell me this when I was younger?’” (Bartasi, who had her twin boys via IVF, is one such woman. When I asked if she would have frozen her eggs when she was younger, she repeated: “You better believe it.”)

Bartasi said that, of the services that Kindbody offers to employers, egg freezing—especially social, or elective, egg freezing —is the most popular with patients. “This social egg freezing [is something] the employers have really gotten behind,” she said. “It’s the majority of patients we see; it’s the majority of patients other clinics see.”

From there, the employer can subsidize any percentage of that total sum for its employees. For example, VICE offers fertility benefits through Progyny; since Progyny has its own network of clinics, as well as its own pharmacy, all costs are considered in-network. According to a representative from VICE’s HR department, if a woman were to freeze her eggs, the most she would expect to pay is her out-of-pocket maximum—which, this year, ranges from $2,000 to $3,000. Another example is GoodRx, which offers the fertility benefit via Kindbody. According to Reena Scoblionko, vice president of people at GoodRx, the company gives $1,000 per employee total (lifetime) to be used toward any fertility-related procedure offered by Kindbody.

This idea of egg freezing as proactive—as a way to take control of your fertility —is central to Kindbody’s branding message of female empowerment. This message dovetails with the argument that Sandberg helped shape, at Facebook and beyond, five years ago: that egg freezing gives women real agency rather than the illusion of it.

For some, however, this emphasis on feminist messaging from all sides helps obscure another force at play: capitalism. Vardit Ravitsky, a bioethics professor at the University of Montreal whose research focuses on reproductive ethics, explained that this is especially prevalent with egg freezing because there’s no way for fertility clinics to show success—at least not right away. (In general, success rates with egg-freezing are still relatively unknown and the procedure does not guarantee a pregnancy. According to Yale Medicine, success depends on the age of the woman at the time she froze her eggs—plus, there’s not enough data on how many women have actually thawed their eggs and attempted pregnancy in the first place.)

“When you do IVF, you really care about your success rates in terms of pregnancies and live births,” Ravitsky said. “[With egg freezing], what you have at stake is how many eggs are good enough to freeze, but you don’t have to show the end result. It’s a great moneymaking machine. And for the fertility industry to combine their interests with those of employers to offer good deals or packages—it’s a win-win for the employer and for the fertility industry [that rests], for me, on the backs of women.”

""I really worry about how this benefit may—instead of creating many different opportunities for how we’re going to manage our fertility and our work—move this into one particular way of doing that.”

The reason for this, according to Ravitsky, is that the benefit, from a pure policy perspective, incentivizes women to delay having children—which, in turn, actually decreases their agency. “The issue with the employer benefit is that it reinforces this societal message that having a baby in your 20s is too young,” she said. “It’s almost treated like teen pregnancy, you know? Most women would like to have babies in their 30s, but either they’re still building their professional status or it’s very difficult to meet someone with whom you want to reproduce. So, to reinforce this social message that we should all be having children later in life… that’s very problematic as a message,” because the chances of reproducing at that stage are significantly lower, with or without egg freezing.",,
The Man Behind London’s Last Video Rental Store,"Few things in a 90s or early 2000s Western childhood equaled the small, solid thrill of the weekend visit to the local video rental shop. Like so many other comforting rituals, its pleasure derived from its predictability. Long before the advent of streaming services, Friday or Saturday evenings were filled with studious deliberation in front of vast walls crammed to bursting with the obvious Hollywood blockbusters, half-forgotten B-movies, and forbidden R-rated numbers with names like Ichi the Killer and I Know What You Did Last Summer.

It’s no secret that the last decade proved to be a global catastrophe for the video rental shop, as the seemingly unstoppable rise of streaming sites and on-demand TV placed intolerable pressure on the older digital way of doing things. A once ubiquitous feature of high streets across the country has dwindled one by one to almost nothing, outside of a handful of independents dotted around the farthest reaches of the UK. It’s a far cry from the golden days of Blockbuster—which shuttered its British stores in 2013 after a dismally protracted descent into bankruptcy—or the region-specific slew of franchises like the Glasgow-based Global Video, and Apollo Films, which saw its 100-plus sites put into administration in 2007 . Last year witnessed what felt like a particularly significant closure, as Vogue Video, Scotland’s very last video store, shut its doors for the final time.

Perhaps I shouldn’t try to speak in universals. After all, not everyone had the good fortune to grow up within walking distance of For Your Eyes Only on Dartmouth Road, in Forest Hill, the half-suburban outpost on the fringes of inner South East London. Since its hands-on proprietor Gulam Charania took over in 1998, the shop has served the area’s diverse viewing needs. Charania has long been considered something of a local legend; both a bona fide film enthusiast and a reliably cheerful presence. It doesn’t matter what you’re after, Charania can probably sort you out, whether it’s long-forgotten PS2 games, the glossiest of new cinema releases, or obscure cult classics.

Charania’s venture into the video rental business was far from preordained. Before For Your Eyes Only, he was in dry-cleaning with his father. “My father had 20-odd shops [in Greater London]. We had a partner of ours decide ‘I’m not interested now,’ and we had to sell the shops off. So he started wholesaling and leasing videos to vendors—remember when all the little newsagents were [renting them out] for a pound a week? He was supplying. He had around 500 customers… [until the] recession in 1988. We were absolutely massive, but all of a sudden that was it. Good job we were a limited company, or we’d have had everything taken off us.”

Still, it’s not an entirely doom-laden story. Occasional reports hint at a minor comeback of sorts for an industry that has been forced to embrace its recently acquired niche status. Every so often, a story pops up about a particular store in Bristol or Merseyside that has managed to keep its head above water. But my research points to For Your Eyes Only as one of the very last of its kind in London, by far the UK’s biggest city and the onetime epicenter for the nation’s video rental trade. When I started putting together this piece in the pre-COVID-19 world of early March, it seemed simple enough to report on. I would spend an afternoon in the shop’s familiar environs with Charania and then walk the couple of miles it takes me to get home in a state of dreamy reminiscence.

After a few more years of getting by, the Charanias had the opportunity to purchase the current space from its previous owner, who had also run it as a video rental. Now For Your Eyes Only is one of the last in London, though he noted that the company that supplies him with movies also stocks a couple hundred other stores around the country.

The years have brought many different challenges, but it was the early days of Netflix’s streaming dominance that gave him the most sleepless nights about the shop’s future. I told Charania that I’m of an age to remember the days when he sat sandwiched between the two behemoths of Apollo and Blockbuster, each store a few hundred yards from his front door. “Oh God yeah, I had some hard times mate, I’ll tell you that,” he said, laughing. “But it was also good for me, because Blockbuster was very expensive, so people would come to me.” It wasn’t just economics. Somehow, you’d always find the newest releases in his store, something Charania says provoked the envy of Apollo in particular.

“They tried to find out [how] and reported me to the film companies, who said ‘Well, if you can find out who’s supplying them we can stop it,’ but obviously, they didn’t know.” Pre-lockdown, Charania told me, he was still averaging 400 rentals a week, solid enough numbers but nothing like the early-2000s glory days. “We used to do 700 to 1,000 back then,” he said with a trace of melancholy. Still, he added, the rate of new members is a cause for optimism, with around 20 people signing up each month.

It’s an encouraging trend, and one Charania chalked up to people’s frustration with the ever-growing cost of streaming subscriptions. With so many competing platforms demanding money and attention, it can often feel like more of a chore than a convenience. What a DVD offers is a steady, physical kind of reliability. “Some people are having internet problems trying to watch something on Netflix or Prime,” he said, alluding to Netflix’s struggles during lockdown, while the lack of real choice is another factor. He recalled going on holiday and staying in one night to watch the streaming platform. “I’m sorry, there were all the little dramas and documentaries, and I was like, ‘Where are the movies?’”

It isn’t just the technology that has changed over the past decade. Forest Hill itself is a vastly different place from the slightly shabby inner suburb of the recent past. Along with Blockbuster and Apollo, several of the pubs and chain shops are also long gone, replaced by their upmarket independent equivalents. It’s been an ambiguous process, broadly made possible by the reopening of the old East London Line as the Overground in 2011. In some ways, the new, monied type of resident has proved a shot in the arm for Charania, even if he’s still very much attuned to the needs of his long-term customer base. “Property prices have gone up. Different faces of people.”

It wouldn’t be right to say I can remember my first visit to For Your Eyes Only, way back in the long submerged and irretrievable past. But I can recall many subsequent trips throughout the years. Nostalgia can often be a futile, painful exercise, but that’s not the case when I cast my mind back to the excitement of standing in front of one of the shop’s walls, staring at all the latest video covers. I wonder if the new clientele find their visits as comforting, without the benefit of their past experiences to draw from? Perhaps it’s impossible to fully explain to anyone who didn’t grow up in the area, or during the golden age of the video rental store, but I’ve never quite been able to understand the idea of Forest Hill without For Your Eyes Only. Like so many other small-business owners, Charania doesn’t know what the future holds. “You don’t know mate, you just don’t know,” he said, right at the start of our call. Maybe his newfound customers have more of an idea.",,
Trump's DOJ Used Civil Rights Law to Shut Down More Than 100 Polling Stations,"A voter walks to cast a ballot at a drop box at an early voting polling location for the 2020 Presidential election in Miami, Florida, U.S., on Monday, Oct. 19, 2020. (Photo: Marco Bello/Bloomberg via Getty Images)

Nationwide, nearly 21,000 polling stations have closed since 2016, a VICE News investigation has found. See More →

Over 100 polling places have closed in several key swing states this election cycle thanks to aggressive prosecutions by the Department of Justice over accommodations for people with disabilities.

Since 2016, President Trump’s DOJ has initiated 23 Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) cases connected to polling-place accessibility since 2016, a big shift in emphasis for the Civil Rights Division under Trump and the two attorneys general who have served in his administration, Jeff Sessions and William Barr.

Passed in 1990, the ADA bans discrimination against people with disabilities in public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private buildings open to the public. Until recently, it was rarely enforced on polling places, which are sometimes held in private spaces like churches. In the decade prior to Trump’s election in 2016, the Department of Justice averaged one polling place-focused accessibility case per year, and prior to 2006, there were no recorded ADA settlements involving polling places.

DOJ prosecutions under the ADA often lead to settlement agreements that can mention remedial steps like building ramps or using alternative entrances, and an agreement to ensure polling places are compliant in the future.

While settlement agreements never explicitly called for municipalities to cut polling sites, a majority of the counties investigated by the DOJ in the last four years did so following the litigation, resulting in a total of at least 103 closures.

Disability rights advocates stressed that while making facilities accessible is an important goal, closures are never the desired outcome. “The solution to inaccessible polling places is not to close them; it’s to make them accessible,” said Michelle Bishop, the Voter Access & Engagement Manager at the National Disability Rights Network.

In a normal election year, 103 closures would be a significant drop, but this year they’re a rounding error on the nearly 21,000 polling stations that have been closed in 2020 in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, as revealed in a VICE News investigation published Thursday. From 2012 to 2016, for example, there was a drop of about 3,000 locations nationally.

But in a highly polarized electorate where a few thousand votes in a given state can swing an election, the loss of polling stations in Ohio, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Texas could have an impact on voter turnout.

”I don’t know why anyone would close polling sites, and I don’t know why DOJ would insist that any polling site be closed,” said Eve Hill, the former head of the Disability Rights Section at the Justice Department who left in 2017. There is no language in recent DOJ settlement agreements requiring jurisdictions to close noncompliant polling places, though they do have the power to prevent closures.

Disenfranchising voters

The closures also tend to disproportionately impact communities of color, which have fewer resources to make polling stations ADA-compliant. They also impact people who are less likely to own cars, such as voters of color, college students, the elderly, and lower-income voters. Traveling greater distances presents a much larger problem without a readily-accessible vehicle, and research shows that increasing the distance to the nearest polling site makes voters less likely to turn out.

An investigation into Coconino County, Arizona, that finished in 2018 found many ADA violations on Native American tribal land. About a quarter of Coconino’s population is Native American, and while tribal buildings are normally not required to be ADA-compliant, once they become polling places, they fall under the law.

After the DOJ’s action, Coconino County shuttered seven of 61 locations in the time between the 2016 election and the 2018 midterms. In one case, the High Country News reported, the closings required Native American voters to travel 10 miles from their original location to reach the next-nearest voting station. Turnout at several relocated precincts in Coconino fell after the changes.

Investigations in several other counties in Virginia, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas also resulted in closures. In one case, a majority Black and Latino suburb of Detroit called Ecorse cut its polling places by a third, from six to four.

Prior administrations rarely brought legal action against municipalities for ADA violations at polling sites, and when they did, the action did not lead to closures.

“We never brought any lawsuits or took legal action against any jurisdiction regarding ADA issues and polling places.”

“Between '73 and '94, we never brought any lawsuits or took legal action against any jurisdiction regarding ADA issues and polling places,” said Gerry Hebert, who served in the Civil Rights division under several administrations.

Eve Hill, the former head of the Disability Rights Division at the Justice Department who left in 2017, said, “I don’t recall any [litigation] where we would reduce the number of polling places.

“I have a great deal of trust and respect for the [career] staff attorneys at the Disability Rights Section. I really don’t believe that they would be seeking closures of polling places,” Hill said. “But they may not be empowered to oppose it.”

The DOJ has the power to prevent local officials from closing polling places by threatening them with further litigation, but Hill said Trump political appointees may not be allowing attorneys to exercise that leverage.

“When the physical accessibility cases get to the point where the section is negotiating a settlement and the jurisdiction is pushing back, I expect then that the political appointees are getting involved with what the remedy may be and pushing [the Disability Rights section] to let the jurisdiction close polling places rather than fixing them,” Hill said.

The Department of Justice declined to comment.

Weaponizing the ADA

The DOJ’s focus on polling place investigations is even more notable because other Justice Department civil rights enforcement activity is at a two-decade low. That includes the Disability Rights section, where cases fell by about 50 percent from Obama’s term. While the Obama administration pursued systemic cases involving large numbers of people affected by disability rights violations in schools and institutions, these cases have disappeared under Trump.

At the same time the Justice Department’s polling place accessibility litigation has spiked, the Voting Section—tasked potentially with prosecuting voter suppression cases—has been almost completely silent. The section upholds the Voting Rights Act, which is meant to protect voters of color from disenfranchisement, but has not filed a single case under that law in Trump’s term. If that trend holds through January, the last four years will be the first presidential term without a Voting Rights Act case since Congress passed the law in its amended form in 1982.

Polling place reviews are one of the few areas of civil rights litigation during Trump’s term where activity is outpacing, rather than significantly lower than, previous administrations.

Because the DOJ does not often announce ongoing investigations, the completed cases they list on the website are likely a small proportion of all the municipalities they have looked into. “There are probably many more cases that are being pursued,” Hill said.

But even investigations that don’t yield formal settlements can result in polling place closures. After the DOJ launched an investigation into polling place accessibility in 2016 in Hamilton County, a Democratic stronghold in Ohio encompassing the city of Cincinnati, the county closed or relocated at least 10 polling places out of their 360 in the following two years due to ADA violations.

In some cases, the Justice Department may not even need to announce investigations to scare counties into closing polling locations. The National Disability Rights Network noted in a report on ADA accessibility that, after the Justice Department concluded investigations into two counties in South Carolina in 2017 and 2018, other nearby municipalities took notice and made their own changes to polling place accessibility. “I think you're definitely onto something when you think that it might be a beginning of an effort to intimidate people,” Hebert said.

Closing polling stations

Then there are cases where municipalities use the ADA as an excuse to close polling stations, even when there’s been no investigation or complaint.

In 2018 in Georgia, county administrators proposed closing seven of Randolph County’s nine polling places immediately before the midterm elections, ostensibly on the basis of ADA violations. Further reporting from the Huffington Post revealed that the administrators had never actually performed any review of whether the polling places complied with ADA regulations, proving that the proposed rationale was a front for an attempt at voter suppression.

The ADA has also been employed to justify voter suppression in other counties. While the clearest example of this was in Georgia, an NDRN report catalogued questionable instances of polling place closures where county administrators cited the ADA in Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. “Local jurisdictions in various states have gotten away with blaming their polling place closures on the access needs of voters with disabilities. The closures effectively suppress the vote in those jurisdictions and create a national environment of fear among voting rights activists,” the NDRN report noted.“

While the Disability Rights section has focused on polling place accessibility, other important disability rights problems have gone unchallenged, such as absentee or mail voting, which can be a challenge for the disabled.

“The Disability Rights section and the Justice Department really has not been involved in any of the disability discrimination issues that are relevant to this year, which are primarily about absentee voting, which is completely inaccessible to people who are blind,” Hill said. “Their absence from that fight is telling.”

Bishop, of the National Disability Rights Network, said that in many cases it’s much easier to resolve ADA-related issues than to find a new location. Fixes can sometimes be as simple as using orange cones to outline accessible parking spaces or improving signage. In some cases, more extensive work is necessary, such as changing the grade of a parking lot or entrance ramp.

Closing polling locations rather than remedying ADA violations can create significant access issues for disabled voters, even if it is intended to help them.",,
"The US Eliminated Nearly 21,000 Election Day Polling Locations for 2020","VICE News obtained data from all 50 states and Washington, D.C., on the number of physical polling locations they will have in place on November 3, and compared their numbers to how many sites they had in 2016 and 2012.

Almost 21,000 Election Day polling places have been eliminated heading into the 2020 U.S. election, a drastic dip in voting locations driven by a heavy shift to mail voting, coronavirus-related consolidations, cost-cutting measures, and voter suppression.

“Closing this many polling places at such a vast scale really does affect voters. Fewer polling places can lead to longer lines, longer wait times, and hurt people, particularly people who are disabled or don’t drive and rely on public transportation,” said Leigh Chapman, the voting rights program director at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

The net result of all of these changes: A 20% dip in polling places across the country from 2016, and a 22% drop since 2012. And while the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated this trend, it didn’t create it: There were more than 3,000 fewer polling locations in 2016 than in 2012.

Of the 45 states that weren’t using mail voting exclusively before the 2020 election, 40 of them have decreased the number of Election Day voting locations from 2016. Of those 40 states who made cuts, 35 are not sending mail ballots to everyone, and 19 require many voters to take it upon themselves to apply for a mail ballot application. The five states that refused to allow mail voting for most people all cut voting sites, including the emerging swing state of Texas.

What emerged was a patchwork of cuts large and small across the country. Many states made these cuts as they were expanding mail voting — 23 states made it easier to vote by mail this year because of COVID. But the overall trend is clear: Most states are eliminating polling locations, a trend that could disproportionately impact poor, young and non-white voters.

But other states reduced Election Day polling sites without doing much else to make voting easier in spite of the coronavirus pandemic, like Texas and Georgia. Some of these cuts came for safety — removing polling stations from nursing homes, for instance — while others were made for budget reasons, or seemingly aimed at suppressing turnout.

A handful of states, including California and New Jersey, have drastically revamped how they conduct elections, pivoting heavily to mail voting and slashing polling places to reallocate resources to handle mail ballots. These states represent most of those who made the deepest cuts. Many, but not all, of these shifts have been in response to the coronavirus. In those states, it will be easier for many people to vote — but not everyone.

President Trump’s frontal assault on mail voting and attacks on the U.S. Post Office also have had a big impact. It’s led Republicans and some Democrats not to trust mail voting and pushing them toward in-person voting, both early and on Election Day. Republicans are voting by mail in much lower numbers than Democrats are, which could, ironically, create the kind of massive logjams in more GOP-leaning communities this year that traditionally have been more common in urban and suburban Democratic-leaning communities.

Recent polling shows that a majority of Americans plan to vote before Election Day, up from 41% who did in 2016 and 25% in 2012. Almost 40 million people had already voted early by mail or in person in the U.S. as of Oct. 21, with almost two weeks to go before Election Day — more than two-thirds of the 57.2 million votes cast before Election Day in 2016. If the pace keeps up, 2020 will smash early-voting records, taking the pressure off Election Day in many states because so many people will have already voted. Long early-voting lines in some locations in states like Texas and Georgia could end up taking the pressure off on Election Day, or they could be a sign of coming problems.

Every state has its own election rules and approaches — and even within states there can be huge disparities between counties. And the impact in a year where people are flocking to vote early by mail and in person in unprecedented numbers won’t be clear until Election Day.

Six states have eliminated at least half of their polling places for the 2020 election: California, Kentucky, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, and North Dakota.

Five states’ cuts make up three-quarters of the total number of polling places eliminated in the U.S. from 2016 to 2020. California alone accounts for almost half of national polling location cuts. Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, and Ohio combine to account for about a quarter of the cuts in terms of raw numbers of polling locations.

The pattern of polling-place closures is widespread: More than half of the 50 states have eliminated at least 10% of their voting sites from 2016 to 2020.

“Having polling locations farther away or that are more crowded creates a hardship for many workers, particularly blue-collar and hourly workers,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson told VICE News.

In the time of COVID, it’s not as safe to ride a bus across town to a new voting site as it would be to walk to the local school where voting used to occur. The people most likely to be impacted by this are disproportionately Black and Hispanic people, who statistically are less likely to have access to a car.

Shuttering polling sites can lead to voter confusion, as people head to the wrong place to vote out of habit or because they haven’t heard their old polling place has been closed or moved. It can also create undue logistical challenges, especially for people who don’t have their own cars, hourly workers who can’t afford to take time off to vote, and parents and others who can’t afford to wait in long lines at polling locations.

While the number and location of Election Day voting sites is just one of many measures of voter accessibility, it’s an often-overlooked factor compared to high-profile partisan fights like mail voting rules, whether and how long states will allow early in-person voting, and voter identification laws.

Most of the states that have made the deepest cuts in physical sites have also moved to dramatically expand mail voting, with many of them also shifting to vote centers, where anyone from a county can go and vote at any of the sites open in the area. But it’s unclear whether these improvements will make up for the cuts they’ve made to in-person voting.

This data set was gathered by reaching out — often multiple times — to every state’s board of elections or secretary of state’s office in the country. In cases where they wouldn’t or couldn’t provide the data, VICE News collected it county-by-county. These numbers were collected in late September through mid-October and may shift a bit by Election Day — some states hadn’t finalized their polling locations when contacted by VICE News, and Pennsylvania’s numbers are an initial estimate; the state didn’t plan on getting a final count until a week before the election.

“This level of doubt this late in the process is concerning. There are so many new variables on top of old problems. We’re talking about how voting will be carried out in the midst of a pandemic. We just don’t know [how it will work out].”

Johnson said even states that have expanded mail voting access while cutting Election Day polling sites are taking a gamble that could hurt some voters.

A recent in-depth study from professors at Harvard University and Boston University of Michigan voters found that while 66% of voters with access to a car voted in the 2018 general election, just 36% of voters without access to a car voted. The study also found that the further away the poll location was from a citizen’s home, the less likely they were to vote.

Mail voting can help alleviate some of this. But another big factor is simply how difficult it is to vote in person if you don’t own a car — a major reason why shuttering voting sites is a big problem, even in states that are rapidly expanding mail voting.

There are plenty of reasons it’s often harder for Black and Hispanic people to vote in person. Intentional voter suppression by white leaders is one driver. Another big factor: Black and Hispanic people are more likely to live in poor communities that underinvest in election resources, staff, and technology. Regardless of race, more densely populated communities tend to have longer voting lines — and Black and Hispanic people are more likely to live in urban areas.

Black and Hispanic voters have long faced steeper obstacles to vote than white voters — and not just in states with an obvious history of voter suppression. A recent study from the Brennan Center for Justice found that in the 2018 midterms, Latinos voting in person on Election Day waited in line almost 46% longer on average than white voters, and Black voters waited 45 percent longer. Fully 7% of all Black voters and 6.6% of Hispanics waited at least a half hour to vote, compared to just 4.1% of white voters. Year after year, some communities see voter lines stretch for multiple hours. This happened with regularity in the 2020 primaries and has already begun to happen during early voting this fall.

“Putting all your eggs in one basket seems like a very bad idea—and it’s avoidable. We’ve seen what happened in the primaries,” said Sylvia Albert, the national director of voting and elections at the good-government organization Common Cause.

Some states that made these pivots in past years saw huge Election Day lines as a result, as local officials underestimated in-person Election Day turnout. Nevada, for instance, had hours-long lines after switching to vote centers in 2018. And this year’s chaotic, COVID-impacted primary season showed that just pivoting to mail and shuttering most poll locations doesn’t work, with massive lines in states like Georgia that expanded mail voting access during their primaries while cutting polling places. Simply put, even the best-intentioned states that are cutting voting locations are trying something new and different, and it’s unclear how well it will work on Election Day.

A recent Pew Research survey found that 33% of people planned to vote on Election Day — the group that these poll closures could impact — while 39% of Americans planned to vote by mail in November, and 21% planned to vote early in person. Fully 56% of white voters who planned to back Joe Biden said they planned to vote by mail, or already had. But only 35% of all Black voters and 40% of all Hispanic voters planned to vote by mail.

And while expanding mail voting is a very positive development, polls show that Black and Hispanic voters have a lot less trust in mail voting than others—especially when Black and Hispanic Democrats are compared to white Democrats.

“If there are fewer polling place locations, the average distance for the average voter is going to be longer,” he said. “And [COVID] could exacerbate some of the effects we’re seeing—not only could it take a long time but they might feel unsafe getting there.”

Harvard professor Justin de Benedictis-Kessner, one of that paper’s coauthors, told VICE News that the voting site cuts found in our study would make it even harder for this group to vote. And he warned that those cuts in the middle of a global pandemic are even more problematic. People who normally might be willing to spend an hour on the bus to get to their voting site may not feel safe doing so this election.

That had a disproportionate impact on Black voters. While only 8% percent of white registered voters didn’t have access to transportation, more than a quarter of Black registered voters didn’t have a car in their household.

The most glaring example — and the one that alarms voting rights experts the most — is Maryland.

Some states have made deep cuts to Election Day voting sites but did little to nothing to making mail voting easier to access.

“You cannot fault voters for being hesitant about vote-by-mail. Obviously I think it’s a great option, but that’s what it is — an option. Voters should be able to choose whichever way they want to vote,” said Albert, Common Cause’s national director of voting and elections.

Even in states that have dramatically expanded mail voting, cuts to in-person Election Day voting sites could lead to disenfranchised voters — and could disproportionately impact poor and nonwhite voters as well as younger voters who are less likely to live at the same address they did in the last election.

“There has been a concerted effort to discredit vote by mail, a concerted effort to undermine and politicize the Post Office, and when you take historic usage rates, where people of color were less likely in most states to use vote by mail, and combine that with extra worry that the mail service was going to be unreliable, of course you’re going to have fewer people voting by mail,” said Myrna Pérez, the director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s voting rights and elections program.

While Trump voters have been dissuaded from mail voting by his false attacks on the integrity of mail voting, some Democrats have been dissuaded because of worries that their mail ballots won’t be counted—especially in light of U.S. Post Office slowdowns caused by the Trump-appointed postmaster general.

That’s not surprising given the long history of voter suppression against voters of color in the U.S. And to this day, Black voters’ mail ballots are rejected at higher rates than white voters’ because of errors on the ballots.

But experts fear this won’t be nearly enough to avoid catastrophe. Parts of Maryland have historically had hours-long voting lines on Election Day. Some voters were forced to wait in line until after midnight during this summer’s primary. This plan could well make things significantly worse.

Republican Gov. Larry Hogan blocked a proposal to send every registered voter a ballot, reversing himself after allowing ballots to be sent out to everyone during the primary. He did approve a plan to send an absentee ballot application to every voter, which could take off a bit of pressure from Election Day. The state has added some mail voting drop boxes as well, retained eight days of early voting, and many areas have switched to vote centers. The state is opening some big voting centers at Camden Yards, where the Baltimore Orioles play, and FedEx Field in Prince George’s County, where the Washington Football Team plays.

The state has moved to eliminate 80% of its polling places, the highest proportion in the country. That includes a 90% cut in heavily Black Baltimore — the city has gone from 296 polling places in 2016 to just 24 this election. There will be almost 19,000 potential voters for every polling place in the state — almost five times more people per polling place than the national average of 4,200.

Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams (R) made clear when the new plan was announced that early in-person and mail voting would need to take the pressure off Election Day polling locations.

That move came as part of a bipartisan deal in response to the coronavirus. Kentucky never allowed early voting for most people before this year. But for this election, Kentuckians have 18 days to vote early in person — every day except Sunday from Oct. 13 through Election Day. The state is also allowing people to vote by mail without an excuse this year.

“Considering the access problems that Native groups have already, closing polling locations in North Dakota is another way to limit access,” said Albert.

North Dakota is another state that’s made deep cuts without making it much easier to vote: It has eliminated almost 60% of its Election Day in-person voting locations. The state has long allowed mail voting. But voters still have to request a mail vote application, fill it out and send it back, then complete and return their actual ballot — a multi-step process that is onerous especially for new voters. Only about one-third of North Dakotans voted by mail in 2018. The state’s substantial Native American population has often faced obstacles to voting, and those who live on reservations often face slower mail and can sometimes lack traditional addresses, complicating how they can receive ballots.

Those include a number of states with a history of voter suppression. When the Supreme Court blew a hole in the Voting Rights Act in 2013, many of the states who previously had to abide by its more restrictive rules quickly moved to cut polling places. And the cuts had a disproportionate impact on Black and Hispanic voters.

Some states have made some major voting expansion moves while cutting polling places, and the net impact on voters won’t be clear until after the election. But others have simply cut polling places while doing little to expand voters’ access to the ballot box.

“If you put too much pressure on any one leg of that stool, then the stool snaps,” Adams said in August.

Texas added an extra week of early voting, but the cuts to Election Day polling places in some key counties have voting rights experts worried. And the cuts are much deeper in some counties than others, though part of that dip is because many counties have switched to vote centers. Counties that have switched to the vote-center model and cut polling places include Tarrant County, home to diverse Fort Worth, which is down 19%, and heavily Hispanic El Paso County, which is down by about 30%.

Texas cut 11% of its polling places on balance since 2012. The state is also one of just five not allowing all voters the option of voting by mail in the middle of the pandemic.

The state hasn’t cut as many polling places as some others, but it’s down 7% since 2016 and 12% since 2012. There have already been some huge lines in some places for in-person early voting.

That includes Georgia, which already had early in-person voting and voting by mail. The state made voting easier by sending ballot applications to every registered voter in the primary, but Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger reversed himself and refused to send out those applications for the general election .

Five states opted to send mail ballots to all registered voters this election for the first time: California, Nevada, Montana (in most counties), New Jersey, and Vermont, as well as Washington, D.C. Altogether, they’ve cut more than 12,000 polling sites.

Many of the states with the deepest cuts to Election Day voting places have made major efforts to expand other types of voting.

It’s unclear what will happen on Election Day in states like these that have made mail voting a bit easier but have also cut polling places. Polls indicate that many more people plan to vote by mail this election than in the past, and preliminary early-voting numbers show that’s definitely occurring in many states. But while that could benefit overall turnout, the Election Day polling site cuts could make it harder for people who prefer to vote in person.

Iowa, another swing state, has cut a quarter of its polling places. And while many counties have sent voters absentee ballot request forms, they still need to fill them out and return them to vote by mail. The state offers a month of early in-person voting.

Ohio still has enough locations that there are only 3,365 voting-age citizens per polling place, below the national average of 4,390 potential voters per polling place. The state has almost a month of early in-person voting, and for the first time it sent out mail ballot request forms to all registered voters.

Ohio has eliminated 860 polling places, the fifth highest number in the country, though that represents 20% of all its voting sites — a cut that’s similar to the national average.

Other states are making less dramatic but still substantial changes to their Election Day plans, and only time will tell whether they work out for voters.

The other states that aren’t allowing everyone to vote by mail this election are Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Indiana, which has largely switched to the vote center model, has cut 18% of Election Day voting sites from 2016 to 2020; Louisiana is down 4% from 2016 and 9% from 2012; Mississippi is down 10% from 2016 and 13% since 2012; and Tennessee is down 17% since 2016.

California’s cuts are absolutely massive: The state has eliminated more than 10,000 voting sites from its 2016 elections. But the state has also taken every effort to make it easier for people to vote. The Golden State has long had a robust mail voting program, and the coronavirus pandemic convinced state officials that they needed to do everything they could to encourage more people to vote by mail. They decided to send every registered voter a ballot in the mail — essentially making it a vote-by-mail state with additional options.

While California has cut almost three-quarters of its voting sites, leaving around 10,000 voting-age citizens per polling location on average, that’s because most of its large counties have opted to switch to vote centers, where anyone who lives in the county can vote at any of their polling locations, rather than have to go to their specific precinct. People can also register to vote as late as Election Day when they go to vote.

The state also has more than 1,200 drop boxes for voters who don’t trust the mail to return their ballots, offers a full month of early in-person voting for those who want to vote in person, and will count all ballots postmarked by Election Day even if they come in days later in the mail. The result has been a surge in early ballot returns much higher than in previous years — 1.5 million were returned within two weeks of being sent out, ten times the number at the same date in 2016 — which will likely take pressure off Election Day voting.

The new model was crafted with heavy input from voting rights and civil rights groups, local community leaders, and local officials, and could well boost voter access and turnout overall. But it does have some risks.

Common Cause California Executive Director Jonathan Mehta Stein, who helped negotiate the plan, told VICE News that he hoped the combination of expanded voting options would help tamp down voting lines on Election Day and before, “But we can’t be certain of that” until the election happens.

The state also has one of the highest rates in the country of people moving, given its sky-high real estate prices and a large proportion of renters to homeowners, a large homeless population, and wildfires that have displaced more than 200,000. Many people will have an easier time voting this election. But for those who’ve moved and haven’t updated their address, or those who don’t have a home address, the new plan could make it harder to vote — especially if they don’t have transportation to the polls.

“We’re concerned about voters who are displaced by the COVID pandemic and voters who are displaced because of the wildfires. There are a lots of people who’ve been pushed out of their homes in 2020,” said Stein.

Nevada and New Jersey, two other states that made deep cuts to Election Day polling sites, also sent ballots to all registered voters for the first time this year, as did most Montana counties. Nevada will also have vote centers and three weeks of extended early voting, as it has in the past, while Montana and New Jersey have essentially become mail-only states this election.

Arizona, a crucial swing state, has made a similar shift, and will have barely half the number of Election Day voting sites it had in 2012.

But the state has long allowed mail voting. Roughly 80% of Arizonans voted by mail the last two general elections, and 88% of Arizonans cast their ballots by mail during the state’s August primary.

Many Arizona counties have also switched to vote centers rather than precincts, so anyone in the county can vote at the most convenient sites. While the state doesn’t send every registered voter a ballot, it does send everyone an application, and many people have opted to become permanent early voters, where they get a ballot automatically sent to them. That could make it less consequential that they’re cutting almost 40% of their Election Day voting sites. But the state has a rapidly growing population, so new voters might not find it so convenient to use the system. And the state’s large Native American population faces unique challenges in voting by mail.",,
What Is Operation Pridefall? 4chan's Anti-Gay Pride 2020 Troll Campaign,"This past Sunday, Horse Meat Disco ran into some difficulties with a Facebook livestream. Instead of a DJ set from London's premier queer disco quadruplet, meant to raise money for the south London LGBTQ institution Eagle London, fans saw nothing.

""It appears we were the target of a far-right group who hacked as soon as we went live,"" wrote Mark Oakley, owner of the Eagle London bar, on the group's Facebook page the next day. ""Having done several dry runs with everything working perfectly well, we ran into immediate difficulties when you all tuned in. The Facebook event simultaneously received high numbers of links to fake donation pages relentlessly posted by bots.""

Horse Meat Disco may have been among the first victims of Operation Pridefall, a concerted effort from the alt-right to get corporations to disassociate their brands from LGBTQ rights. To do this, trolls are planning to disrupt Pride month celebrations, which have become uniquely vulnerable this year because of coronavirus, with the vast majority taking place online.

The plan was hatched in May on 4chan's /pol/ (Politically Incorrect) discussion board. ""It's quite simple,"" the organisers wrote in a list of detailed instructions. ""Every June, hundreds of massive corporations band together to smother social media with posts in favor of 'Pride Month', a code word for the degeneracy that is LGBT activism.""

From the 1st June, when Pride month started, they instructed people to drop a ""shitton [sic] of disturbing redpills on homosexuality on the comments"", specifically on brand pages promoting Pride on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

To try to drown out Pride content in a sea of homophobic memes and commentary, the organisers encouraged people to target small pages with little engagement: ""The bigger pages are ok targets, but posts tend to get unnoticed in the sea of other comments. Commenting on smaller pages (100 likes or so) means anyone who views it will see the posts, and companies will reconsider their posts afterwards.""

They also provided participants with a pack of downloadable, viciously hateful memes.

Dr Jeremy Price is the Assistant Professor of Educational Technology at the Indiana University School of Education-Indianapolis at IUPUI. A portion of his research has involved studying online hate crime.

""I've seen a lot of things happen in the past couple of years where explicit hate has become much more prominent on online spaces,"" he says over Zoom. ""4chan is the industrial centre that churns these things out. I have to say that some of it is rather creative in its own sense. They've started thinking, 'How can we think about shifting the norms of discourse so that they align more with our hateful and nihilistic perspective?' They create things in order to try to make that happen.

""I started looking into this [Pridefall]. It was very similar to the [4chan] psy-ops [psychological operations] that happened in late December with respect to the black and Jewish communities, and trying to turn them against each other.""

On TikTok, the plan is to trick older siblings and relatives of Gen Z kids – only two-thirds of whom identify as ""exclusively heterosexual"" – into inadvertently mocking them. Organisers outlined plans to encourage them to perform a ""shitty gesture"", ""whore dance"" or ""charade"", and to add anti-LGBTQ tags to ""literally build a puppet army to fuck the shit out of millennials"".

In doing so, they are trying to ""foment disagreement within the community"", Price notes, again drawing parallels with similar attacks on the Jewish community.

On top of all that, the trolls say they are targeting dating apps – Tinder, Grindr and Bumble – ""with legit, convincing images"" to ""criticise LGBT"" [people]. To avoid people rumbling them using Google reverse image search, they are using a website called ThisPersonDoesNotExist, which uses AI to create unique, realistic-looking pictures of fake people.

The most efficient way to combat this, says Price, is to report the profiles as either fake or for using hate speech. The former will get faster results: social media platforms care more about fake profiles as they threaten their business model. Doing this will also train the algorithms to be better aware of accounts that match the same activity.

The strategy might appear simple – set up a bunch of fake accounts and demonise queer people in the comments section – but the psychology behind it is more complex. Instead of immediately going in full pelt, organisers plan a more insidious approach, which they hope will gradually turn the tide of opinion against queer people.

As Pride month progresses, the trolls will gather on 4chan and organise an escalation of the frequency and intensity of the campaign. ""Think about [it] as waves,"" the organiser told participants in their induction. ""Day 1 is simply questioning homosexuality then as the days go on it will get worse and worse until the end of Pride month.

""This is something that white nationalists have done in recent years,"" says Price. ""They see 'normies' – people who consider themselves to be LGBTQ friendly or neutral – to start imagining, you know, members of this community as something other than benign.""

How would they do that exactly? ""My sense is that, over the course of the month, they want to get people to think about members of the LGBTQ community as paedophiles. And in order to do that, the way they see it, is by gradually shifting the discussion."" As public opinion alters, they hope, brands will distance themselves from the LGBTQ community.

""Keep it normie palatable/friendly,"" wrote the organiser, indicating that they want trolls to at first appear as reasonable commenters. ""This means no Nazi/Hitler shit, the goal is to make them question whether what they are supporting is really the right thing.""

Samantha, the woman who brought this to the general public's attention when she tweeted about it, says she thinks 4chan in general is a dark place full of dangerous people. ""Remember that the main intent of this was to try to convert people, who might be straight and centrists, into raging homophobes and transphobes,"" she says. ""That's what I think is the most dangerous.""

How did she feel when the tweet started gaining traction? ""Nervous, because me being a queer Jewish woman puts a huge target on my back. But I didn't take it down because the post was for the betterment and safety of the community, and I'd risk myself for that.""",,
Amsterdam's Red Light District Is Open for Business Again,"""I screamed with joy when I heard we could go back to work,” said Foxxy, sex worker and spokesperson for Amsterdam's sex worker advocacy organisation, PROUD, who worked in the red light district for years, but now sees customers in her own home.

During the first few months of the pandemic, sex workers who rent windows qualified for government aid. But escorts and others working in sex clubs missed out, meaning a large portion of sex workers in Amsterdam haven’t seen a pay cheque in months. It’s because they work under the Netherlands’ so-called ""opt-in"" regulation, which means workers aren’t considered freelance or employed with benefits, but do pay taxes. For them, the reopening of De Wallen signifies some light at the end of a very long tunnel.

Dutch sex workers were allowed to go back to work at the start of July, after four months off the job. Many had been eagerly awaiting the day, It was a happy day for the local sex worker community, as many struggled to pay rent and bills during the closure of Amsterdam’s famous red light district, known locally as De Wallen.

Most will have to wait for their customer base to slowly make their way back – but not all. “For some women, that first night was the most lucrative night they’ve ever had,” said Foxxy. “Only a few windows were open, so any customer who showed up went to see those workers.”

Despite the excitement, De Wallen – which is normally swarming with tourists this time of year – isn't busy yet. ""We were allowed to go back to work with a week's notice, which was unexpected,"" said Foxxy. ""Lots of sex workers needed time to prepare: they wanted to get their hair and nails done, they didn’t have a room lined up to work from.""

De Wallen also relies heavily on tourists, and they haven’t returned to pre-pandemic numbers. Foxxy said she feels conflicted. “Most tourists, like Germans and Brits, come from countries where the [coronavirus] numbers aren’t great right now. I don’t think it’s safe to allow them in yet. I do hope that [local] customers who would normally avoid the city centre because it’s too busy come to the De Wallen now.”

According to Van Burk, consumer behaviour is also fuelling the uncertainty. “Some of the customers were so excited that they came back to the red light district right away. But when you look at Belgium, you see that the first few days were busy, but since then it’s slowed down because tourism has slowed to a halt.”

“Compared to before the pandemic, about half as many rooms are being rented out [by sex workers] at night. During the day, we're renting almost the same amount as before,” Van Burk said. “It’s difficult to predict how things will turn out. Lots of our renters from Eastern Europe need to first get on a plane back to the Netherlands.”

Pim van Burk has also witnessed the slow restart. He manages My Red Light, an organisation that rents out rooms to sex workers, while also making sure they can do their job safely.

To minimise risk, Anna currently only has sex with customers doggy style. “As soon as a customer comes in, he and I wash our hands together,” she explained. She also asks all of her customers to wear a mask. She said some of her customers ask her to do the same.

Anna* is a sex worker in the red light district. She’s relieved to be back at work and is taking precautions to keep both herself and her customers safe. The small table in her work space holds a bottle of Yakult and a small package of crackers, plus a bag of face masks, disinfectant and an infrared thermometer she's invested in to test visitors for a fever. ""Yesterday, a customer measured 36.5 degrees Celsius when they entered. When we were done, it was 36.7,” she laughed.

The women also have to wash their hands after every interaction, while anything the customer has touched is cleaned thoroughly afterwards. But disinfecting has always been a mainstay in these rooms. Face masks are also available in the rooms Van Burk rents out, but neither sex workers nor customers are legally required to wear them.

My Red Light's Van Burk explained that the Dutch national health institute, RIVM, has introduced tailored protocols for sex workers during the pandemic. He’s printed them off and put them on the door of every room, so workers can go through the steps with each customer: “First, they ask about their client’s health. If someone is sick, they have to refuse service.”

In Belgium, the government has banned sex workers and their clients from certain sex positions for the time being. But here, anything is fair game as long as there’s no kissing or breathing into each other’s faces.

""We’ve also decided to discontinue the use of our bath tubs, because that seems unsafe to me,” Van Burk said. Showering after seeing a customer isn’t a legal requirement, and Van Burk won’t ask renters to do so. “If you have to shower after each customer, you might end up showering 80 times a week. That’s terrible for your skin and overall health,” he said. “And often it’s not even necessary: the towel on each bed is replaced in between customers. Blow jobs are the most popular service in the red light district. It’s always been very clean around here.""

Though sex workers’ rooms might currently be among the cleanest spaces in the city centre, the new safety measures have created issues. “Some [sex] clubs can’t reopen, because they can’t guarantee one-and-a-half metre's distance,” Foxxy said. Both clubs and sex workers are also now required to record the names and numbers of their customers. Foxxy said this violates customer privacy.",,
How Coronavirus Is Affecting Sex Workers,"When asked, a spokesperson for RIVM , the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, said there was no specific health advice for sex workers trying to navigate the pandemic. “But if we advise people not to shake hands, we of course also advise against more intimate forms of contact,” they said.

In the Netherlands, sex workers are struggling as well, with sex clubs forced to shut their doors for the time being. The government's restrictions, while less drastic than neighbours Germany and France , currently require people to keep a 1.5-metre distance from each other – which excludes many forms of sex work.

As the coronavirus pandemic wreaks global havoc and governments are forced to shut down services in order to save lives, workers across all industries are feeling the effects. While healthcare workers fight on the front line of the crisis, many governments have ordered non-essential services to close, leaving hospitality staff (among many others) in the lurch, while those in the creative and performance industries also face uncertain futures.

At the Prostitution Information Center , we’re working on solutions for sex workers who are ending up on the streets, but we’d very much welcome support from the government. I hope an emergency fund will be established for sex workers, but I’m afraid that people will just resort to saying that we should have chosen a different profession.

The effects on Amsterdam’s red light district are disastrous. It’s completely empty at the moment. Lots have decided to close up shop, but the women who rent their little private rooms still have to pay 720 euros a week in rent [Foxxy Angel has since told VICE that rent has been put on hold in the red light district]. These same sex workers are often from Bulgaria, Romania or Italy and can't go home at the moment.

I had already started to notice the effects in the past few weeks. Gang bang sessions usually attract about 40 men – the first week of March I only had 11. I understand why I had to cancel, but it’s also frustrating: the same people who opted out of a gang bang at the time were still taking the metro and the bus.

This is a very difficult time for us. We’re barely making any money, because lots of private clients are canceling at the last minute. One of my revenue streams is organising a bi-weekly gang bang, but since early March, when we found out the number of infections in the Netherlands was on the rise, I’ve canceled them all.

""Gang bang sessions usually attract about 40 men – the first week of March I only had 11""

It’s a tough new reality for sex workers who don’t have alternative income streams. We called four people in the industry to ask what impact coronavirus has already had on their business, if they’re worried about their health and how they plan to make money in the meantime.

I’m currently rationing my supplies: I bought food in bulk so I can freeze some and that way, hopefully I can keep paying my rent. I’m also applying for different jobs in the sex industry and I hope something will materialise. I need to find a different way to make money as soon as possible, or I’ll end up on the street. Foxxy Angel, sex worker and Prostitution Information Center (PIC) spokesperson.

""The whole community has been very understanding""

I’m in the leather scene, but also organise meet-ups for people who like to dress up as toddlers. I was supposed to throw a toddler party early March, but I canceled it. Amsterdam was meant to host Amsterdam Bear Weekend (from 19 to 23 March) with parties all over the city, but that was canceled as well.

People who throw these parties pay big deposits up front and are feeling the hit right now. Still, the whole community has been very understanding. That’s what sex and fetish parties are mostly about: a sense of community.

I can do a lot of stuff online, like share photos and maintain my personal site that people pay to use, but a big part of my work in the kink world happens offline. We’re still allowed to organise private parties and get-togethers for less than 100 people [this policy has since changed in the Netherlands], but I don’t think it’s the responsible thing to do right now.

As for my health, I already had lots of sanitary supplies like gloves and antibacterial gels at home – you’re much more aware of personal hygiene when you throw sex parties. I find it pretty funny that everyone is finally starting to wash their hands properly. Emma, throws kink parties and meet-ups.

""Not everyone cares about the rules. I still get phone calls asking if we are open""

As one of Europe's bigger sex clubs, we host people from all over the world on a daily basis. We throw parties, run a large restaurant and also have a lot of rooms where couples have sex – both with each other and with others.",,
The Strange Link Between Pandemics and Psychosis,"By 1919, the Spanish Flu pandemic had spread influenza to a third of the world's population, or around 500 million people. Psychiatrist Karl Menninger was treating people at Boston Psychopathic Hospital who'd recently been infected. But his patients had symptoms far beyond what's usually associated with the flu. In a paper on 100 cases he saw over three months, he described seeing extreme mental disturbances—over half of his patients had some sort of psychosis, and almost two-thirds had hallucinations.

Figuring out a potential connection between widespread infection and mental illness has a larger purpose: it could lead to new treatment options for select individuals whose disorders have an immunological origin. And, with a new viral infection sweeping the globe, one that’s not the flu but nonetheless shares some things in common with past pandemics, it’s especially relevant to lend a critical eye to how viruses and infections could influence our minds.

Infection and inflammation are now recognized as risk factors for mental disorders of all kinds. Yet, the underlying reason for the flu’s sticky relationship with schizophrenia is still a mystery. Some experts propose that influenza could interfere with fetal development through a mother’s immune system, or that influenza could bring on some kind of autoimmune disorder that interacts with the brain.

It wasn't the first time this association has been made. While today, we consider viral infections to be diseases of the body—they infect the lungs, give us fevers, stuffy noses, or a cough—throughout history there’s also been a strange link between influenza and psychotic disorders similar to schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder that can affect how people think. More recently, this link re-emerged from the observation that babies born in the winter or early spring, when mothers may have been exposed to the flu, are more likely to develop schizophrenia as adults.

Then, in a follow-up study, Menninger reported that nearly all of those patients got better. Their madness disappeared when they recovered from the flu. He suggested that, in these patients, there might be some connection between the flu and their psychiatric illnesses.

“These kinds of stories have been recounted again and again,” said Tom Pollak, a psychiatrist and researcher at King's College London. He and his colleagues recently published a review paper on the associations between influenza and schizophrenia. It came out for the 100-year anniversary of the 1918-1919 Spanish influenza pandemic, but the timing turned out to be ""slightly unnerving,"" as a viral infection, COVID-19, caused by a new coronavirus, spreads throughout the world. The outbreaks were officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

During historical influenza epidemics, it was common to refer to the “psychoses of influenza.” In the mid-1890s, British medical journals were full of tales like these, according to Mark Honigsbaum, a historian of medicine at City University of London.

“I have seen men, within twenty-four hours of taking the influenza, sob like children for hours together as though their hearts would break,” England's Prime Minister Lord Rosebery wrote of influenza in 1895. “The sacredness of life is seen only through a flimsy veil of conflicting emotions of doubt, of dread, and of determination to burst these bonds by one fell swoop of severance from the mortal to immortality.”

After outbreaks of influenza in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1889, people experienced insomnia, depression, suicidal thoughts, and homicidal urges. One neurologist wrote that it wasn't uncommon for people with the flu to feel “dark forebodings of…impending disaster” or to think they had committed a “fearful crime” and were about to be punished.

The idea that psychosis has an infectious origin has deep historical roots. There are multiple examples from hundreds of years ago in which people got infected with what we now recognize as the flu, and had periods of mental instability during or immediately after.

While not all the women who were exposed to the flu had children with schizophrenia—meaning it wasn't a sure thing—they concluded that their data suggested up to 14 percent of schizophrenia cases would not have occurred if those mothers hadn’t been exposed to influenza during early to mid-pregnancy.

Brown and his colleagues followed up on the children who were eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia or similar psychotic disorder, and compared their mother's blood samples to matched controls. They found that children of women who had been exposed to the flu during the first half of pregnancy were three times more likely to have schizophrenia. (About 11 percent of pregnant women get the flu during pregnancy.)

Alan Brown, a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Columbia University, tried to fix that in a study from 2004 : He examined medical records of more than 12,000 women in California who were pregnant between 1959 and 1966 who had blood samples available—making it possible to test if mothers had antibodies present for the flu.

In all, over 25 epidemiologic studies have now looked specifically at the flu-schizophrenia connection in pregnant women. Yet, the results have been mixed. Half have replicated the finding, and half have not. The studies may have inconsistent results because it’s hard to know exactly who did and didn’t have the flu when you look into the past and don't have data to prove who was sick.

More recent studies have continued examining the connection between influenza and schizophrenia—but through the flu’s potential effects on a developing fetus. More than 200 papers have found that winter- and spring-month births are associated with greater risk for schizophrenia, raising the possibility that if mothers get the flu, it could somehow affect their children . In 1988, psychologist Sarnoff A. Mednick looked into the 1957 influenza pandemic and showed that there were higher rates of schizophrenia in people born during the pandemic compared to a group of people born shortly afterwards.

One fringe theory is that the body might make antibodies that trigger an immune response that attacks the brain. One example where something similar to this happens is autoimmune encephalitis. Like in Susannah Cahalan's memoir, Brain On Fire, autoimmune encephalitis can severely compromise mental health and look a lot like psychosis. But there's no hard evidence yet of any such response for the flu.

It's unknown if all these risks happen by the same or different mechanisms. But taken together, it's evidence that shouldn't be ignored, said Pollak. ""I think the idea that infection is a risk factor for the development of psychiatric illness is pretty much indisputable now,"" he said. “It gives us a mandate to start looking at the immune processes that might underlie these psychiatric disorders.”

These ties between infection and mental illness are varied, and we don't yet understand if they are knotted together, or completely separate. There’s evidence that children who get a lot of infections when they’re young have increased rates of getting schizophrenia, and that postmortem brains of people with schizophrenia have abnormal immune cells . In 1918, Menninger observed that psychiatric symptoms can arise right after influenza, while research from the 1957 pandemic suggested that the effects waited until children grew up, years later.

In Denmark, large studies have found that infections and autoimmune diseases throughout life are associated with the increased risk of many other mental disorders too. A study from 2016 looked at every person born in Denmark from 1983 to 2002 and found that those with infections treated with anti‐viral medications and those requiring hospitalizations were more likely to have schizophrenia and affective disorders.

This concept has been observed in animal models, like mice given immune stimulants at different phases of pregnancy. Mice don’t actually have to be infected by something for their babies to have behavioral differences—if researchers trigger a severe immune reaction (the same kind that occurs after an infection), it’s enough. Rhesus monkeys that were infected with the flu during pregnancy had babies with smaller brains and other abnormalities similar to those seen in schizophrenia, Spectrum reported. (There is no evidence, though, of an association between the immune response brought on by the flu vaccine and schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.)

“You feel like crap,” Pearce said. “You have zero energy, you can’t get up. A lot of that is from pro-inflammatory molecules that are floating around.” Those symptoms and molecules may be subtly altering how a baby’s brain is forming, even though the baby doesn’t get infected with the virus itself.

The story for influenza must be different, because it doesn’t appear to attack the fetus’s brain directly. But when pregnant mothers get sick, Pearce said, their bodies are doing a lot to fight the virus, like making inflammatory molecules.

How might a viral infection affect the brain in a growing fetus? Brad Pearce, a neuroscientist and epidemiologist at Emory University and author of Can a Virus Cause Schizophrenia? , said that other infections, like rubella, can cross the placenta. In one study, 20 percent of people exposed to rubella in the first trimester developed schizophrenia as an adult, compared to the 1 percent of the population that gets it normally. “The organism itself, the virus, gets into the [fetus’s] brain and it alters the growth of brain cells,” Pearce said.

Pollak said it could be that these viral infections and immune responses don’t cause schizophrenia on their own, but contribute to an overall risk. Someone might then need to have an additional event happen later in life, like a second severe infection, psychological stress, or trauma—all overlaid over genetics.

“The infection is a sort of a primer and it puts you on this trajectory, which is abnormal, but you probably need another hit later on in order to develop the full illness,” Pollak said.

The next step is to better understand how the immune system affects the brain more generally, said Emily Severance, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University. “This disorder is complex and multifactorial and also has a genetic component that we haven’t yet addressed,” Severance said.

When geneticists started to look for genes that are responsible for schizophrenia, large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have often picked up genes that are associated with the immune system.

“Neuroscientists can think of the brain first and everything else, the body, as second,” Pearce said. “But kind of to their surprise, immune areas of the genes that were expressed in immune cells kept coming up. So now I think we've accepted the fact that the strongest signals for schizophrenia and GWAS studies are still around immune areas.”

And what about the new coronavirus? There are few answers about how pregnant women should operate during this pandemic—though one very small study in China found that three babies born to mothers with COVID-19 did not test positive for the virus when they were born.

Only one previous study has looked at coronaviruses and psychotic symptoms later in life. In 2011, Severance and her colleagues did a study on four kinds of coronaviruses (coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, and they chose four previously known ones). They found adults with schizophrenia had higher exposure rates—they found more antibodies to the coronaviruses in that group than in people without schizophrenia. What that means for the current COVID-19 outbreak is hard to say, but Severance noted that “the association between infection and psychosis would be relevant for any emerging pathogen, especially for women who are pregnant.""",,
Psychotic Delusions Change With the Times. They’ve Started to Include COVID-19,"In early March, a 43-year-old man in Germany began to hear his neighbors talking about him. Their voices blamed him, a former healthcare worker, for not providing enough medical care to his parents. His parents could die from COVID-19 as a result of his negligence, the voices said. In fact, his neighbors were at risk of dying too—and it was all his fault.

Yet these accusations were not from people who lived nearby, but were voices stemming from the man's own mind. He had been diagnosed with paranoid psychosis in 2011. When he was previously hospitalized, he heard voices then too—voices that similarly made critical judgements about his actions. But his current delusions were new ones, and hyper-focused on the pandemic. The man also believed that he was immune to COVID-19 after having been infected by a Chinese message on WhatsApp.

According to the report his doctors published recently in Psychiatric Research, his case is the first official documentation of COVID-19-related delusions in a psychotic patient, and it reveals the potential of the pandemic to influence the symptoms of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.

The delusions that psychotic people experience are not meaningless noise; they are heavily influenced by what's going on in the world. Historical events, politics, culture, technology, and yes, pandemics, can all be mirrored in the delusional beliefs of mentally ill people. (In 2009, during the swine flu pandemic, people diagnosed with schizophrenia felt their own risk of infection was higher than healthy controls.)

It's one way in which the current pandemic, even when it eventually comes to an end, will continue to haunt us, especially those with mental health issues. People with psychotic disorders could remain stuck with pandemic delusions even after a vaccine is developed or society is reopened. Recognizing that COVID-19 delusions might be here to stay will be crucial in the treatment of psychotic disorders in the years ahead.

""If you were to present me with a hundred people with psychosis and none of them mentioned COVID-19, I would think that was bizarre,” said Joel Gold, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai “The productions of the minds of people with psychosis have meaning. And we should take it very seriously.”

On Halloween night in 2003, at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, Gold first saw a patient who believed he was living in a version of The Truman Show—the 1998 movie about a man whose whole life has been constructed around him as fodder for a hit television program.

In 2012, Gold and his brother Ian published a paper about this new delusional belief (they called it The Truman Show Delusion) which was cropping up in other patients too. Like Mr. A—a man who said he had known for five years that his life was just like the movie. He flew to New York because he believed that 9/11 never happened and seeing the Twin Towers still standing could prove that news events were staged as part of the television programming. When he was admitted to the psychiatry department, he asked to speak to the “director.”

Watch more from VICE:

The Truman Show Delusion couldn't exist without the film, The Truman Show. The movie didn't cause the psychosis to occur, per se, but its themes influenced the patients' disease and their experience of paranoia and delusion, as the COVID-19 pandemic is doing for the man in Germany.

Throughout history, delusional beliefs have picked up on the culture and history surrounding them—some beliefs have peaked in certain eras, then are rarely seen again. King Charles VI of France, in the 14th century, suffered from a common delusion among the rich and royal: the glass delusion. He thought that his body was made of glass, and vulnerable to breaking. He is said to have wrapped himself in blankets to keep his butt from shattering when he sat down.

After the 1830s, the glass delusion disappeared. Later in the 19th century, when cement started to commonly be used as a building material, cement delusions appeared instead, which led people to think they were made of the material.

In Revolutionary France, the guillotine often headlined in delusions—it doesn’t much any more. In the 1940s, psychotic patients had delusional beliefs that they were controlled by radio waves, whereas today delusions are technologically updated to concern implanted computer chips.

Daniel Freeman, a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Oxford, said that in the past, the content of delusions was mostly ignored. “Once it was established that the belief was false, then talking about the delusion was discouraged,” he said. “The content of the delusion was considered largely meaningless, even viewed as ‘empty speech acts’.”

But there’s recently been a transformation in how delusions are viewed. It’s now understood that these beliefs don't appear out of nowhere, and that they're not random, said Clara Humpston, a research fellow at the Institute for Mental Health at the University of Birmingham. Some researchers think that delusions come about from the mind trying to understand physical or mental sensations that are confusing—like hearing voices, seeing things, or having cognitive difficulties.

Humans need to find meaning or explanations for those experiences. A person feels perplexed or confused about what is happening around them, and then “there is a moment of enlightenment,” she said. “They suddenly realize, 'Oh it's because I’m being persecuted or watched.' It takes time to develop a fully systematized delusion and the content is usually based on what gives the person meaning.”

When clinicians spend time listening and talking to people with delusions, it’s clear that those beliefs are linked to their personal experiences, environments, and values, Freeman said. Providers engaging with what their patients believe could impact the experience and treatment of their illness.

""Delusions can be hard to change because they often explain such uniquely personal, and often puzzling, experiences,"" Freeman said. ""But it is possible for delusions to change, when individuals are in the right space to calmly consider alternative views and make new learning themselves from direct experience.""

The pandemic is going to trickle into delusional beliefs because it is dominating our lives, and also provoking so many powerful emotions. Just living through it could be exacerbating symptoms for psychologically vulnerable people.

“It is a time of raised anxiety levels,” Freeman said. “Even just going outside can make us anxiously think: What is going on? And what is going to happen? And paranoia feeds off fear. As anxiety goes up, paranoia tends to follow in its wake. We may expect higher levels of paranoia in this crisis.”

Several of Humpston's colleagues have told her that they have seen cases of COVID-related delusions in psychotic patients too, though they haven't published about them yet. Patients believed that they had contracted COVID-19 over the phone, or that the whole pandemic was started intentionally by various governments around the world.

Many aspects of the pandemic just so happen to line up with common themes that have persisted in delusional beliefs for centuries, making it more ripe for delusional appropriation. These themes include that a person has lost agency or ownership over their actions or thoughts, that they’re being influenced by an external force, or that there’s a conspiracy or organization targeting them. These insidious influences are often invisible, like a virus.

Humpston said that while we can’t know for certain, she thinks it’s likely that these COVID-19 delusions aren’t going away any time soon. Freeman agreed that it would be “remarkable” if the coronavirus pandemic did not feature in psychosis in the years to come.

Delusional thoughts, though false, can show the profound ways society has been impacted or changed. The Truman Show Delusion was just that—a delusion. But it also revealed how we now live in a world where our technologies are incredibly capable of surveilling us. “I think that shines a light on some of the ways that society is shifting,” Gold said.

James Tilly Matthews, considered to be one of the first well-documented cases of paranoid schizophrenia in the late 1700s, thought there was a large machine called the Air Loom underground in London. The Air Loom was controlling his thoughts and actions through electromagnetic waves.

Roy Porter, a historian of science, wrote in an essay on Matthews that the Air Loom was an attempt to make sense of the times Matthews was living in: he ""reacted to the bewildering chaos of the French Revolutionary drama of death and danger, double-dealing and double-meanings by repotting them all within his own private imaginative scenario."" He thought that Matthews' delusions also reflected the mistreatment of asylum patients by cruel doctors. ""Every age gets the lunatic it deserves,"" Porter wrote.

But Gold pointed out that delusional content reflecting the world around it is not necessarily surprising. After all, COVID-19 has enmeshed itself into all of our thoughts and anxious ruminations, psychosis or not. People are going to incorporate COVID-19 into their cognitions and feeling states no matter their psychiatric health. In the years to come, all of us will worry much more about virus transmission, cleanliness, or large group events than we did before.

Healthy people can often think they don’t have a lot in common with psychotic people; schizophrenia is one of the most stigmatized mental illnesses. But while COVID-19 might start showing up in delusional beliefs, it will continue to haunt all of us in different ways. In that sense, we are not so different.

“I do think that someone walking into a psychiatric ER a year from now is going to be talking about COVID,” Gold said. “But you know, we’ll be talking about COVID a year from now too. Just because someone has a diagnosis like schizophrenia doesn’t mean that they don’t live in the same world that we do. This is going to be an active element in all of our lives for years.”",,
How to Support Someone You Care About if They're Stuck at Home With Bigots,"How to Stay In is a series about redefining ""normal"" life in order to take care of ourselves and one another during the COVID-19 pandemic. See More →

Because of the added stress of the restrictions and lifestyle changes brought on by COVID-19, this election season feels even more hellish than usual, especially depending on where and with whom a person has to live. Some of the people we care about are trapped by circumstance in homes where Fox News blares all day, QAnon is a regular subject of dinner conversation, and/or they can’t discuss even anodyne topics like getting a new phone without setting off a 20-minute shriek-a-thon about the wages of sin/the imperilment of ""the suburbs""/socialism/the list goes on.

I would really like for all of our friends, siblings, and partners enduring politically exhausting home lives to live and be as well as possible through this weird, difficult, extended episode of The Circle: Pandemic Edition, made all the weirder and more difficult by a highly consequential presidential election. What can you, a layperson who cannot rent them an all-expenses-paid apartment or provide them professional counseling, do to help a friend enduring their family's shitty politics otherwise? Here are some ideas.

(To be clear, before we start: We're talking about upsetting or even oppressive home situations. If you fear for your loved one’s life or immediate safety, they need more direct help. The Crisis Text Line will connect them to support resources; The Trevor Project offers phone, text, and online chat to LGBT2Q people; and if a person is under 21, they can call Child Help. Calling the police is generally not the most helpful choice unless they're facing an immediate threat. Use this as a last resort only.)

Make time for regular phone conversations.

Hearing a friend’s voice is emotionally a whole different—and much nicer— feeling than seeing their words on a screen. Does it feel awkward to just… call someone? Name the awkwardness (“Let’s pretend to be Olds and have a phone call!”) and give it a shot anyway.

You can talk while you do another task—phone calls are great for cleaning, getting ready for the day, and other not-as-fun-without-the-phone tasks. Make a phone-date with the person you’re trying to support to do chores and talk on the phone together. If they’re afraid of being overheard, there are cars to clean, leaves to rake, rock borders to weed, or dogs to walk, and keeping busy helping out around the house shuts off at least one avenue of parental complaint. (Alternatively: “I’m going for a walk!” is usually acceptable.)

Once you’re on the phone, take the temperature of their mood—what kind of call is it going to be? Sometimes it works best to keep the conversation neutral and let your beleaguered friend call the shots. However, if they’re miserable and exhausted and biting their tongue constantly, you can give them a little help. Try offering a menu of options, like: “Press one for a cheerful and distracting series of light conversational topics. Press two to access our Shouting Department, where you can yell about those assholes as much as you like to our trained staff, who will get mad with you. Press three to talk about what just happened on Real Housewives of Potomac, because I have a LOT of feelings about it.” Whatever they choose, deliver on it.

Be attentive to and account for prying eyes and ears.

Phone calls might not always be an option, though. Is your friend being watched for signs of seditious behavior? You may need to keep your comms channels under wraps, especially if your pal is reliant on their relatives for housing. Keep the text stream between you fluffy as a bunny with a pancake on her head by sending photos of cute animals, articles about children raising money for inarguably virtuous causes, and the occasional dreamy travel pic of Italy. Meanwhile, you can do your realer-deal communicating in a Google Doc, exchange files of movies and music through a shared, password-protected Dropbox, or use a Slack channel created for the express purpose of shitposting.

The more President Business your method of getting in touch looks from the outside, the better your chances at keeping your communication private. Name your chats and folders things like ""Group Project Econ 201,""

""Student Government Minutes Fall/Winter 2020,” or ""Clean Streets Campaign"" for extra security (just not ""Taxes,"" because everyone knows that’s the first place to check for things a person might not want others to see).

Recommend music, movies, books and TV shows to give your loved one something else to focus on.

One of the hallmarks of this pandemic is the unrelieved sameness: same toast for breakfast, same sweatpants, same Granddad yelling about how immigrants and refugees (whom he calls several different, but all awful, racist epithets) are ruining the country.

Puncture the sameness bubble by offering new things to look at, read, and listen to, and ask them if they'll do the same for you. Share your top 10 Star Trek, Girlfriends, or Sex and the City episodes; make a playlist of the 15 songs that made up the soundtrack of your childhoods; send each other books—basically, add new things to their world that provide comfort, care, and a sense of escape.

You can use this to show interest in them-the-person, which might not feel possible for them at home. Explain your choices and vice versa: Of course they want to know which song was playing when you and [redacted] were just about to [redacted] in [redacted]’s dad's cabin junior year.

Whatever you choose, the point is to give your friend concrete, fun things to focus on besides another night of spaghetti alla MAGA.

Encourage them to talk about the news with you, their friend and a reasonable human being.

Being constantly overridden and shouted down can make anyone feel like shutting up, or even giving up, and we do not want that. You don’t even have to agree with everything that your friend believes, but I’m confident you can discuss it with them better than their family is.

Talk about news, politics, and current events—who won a recent prize for literature or music or sportsing, and how do we feel about it? Which powerful cabinet member of the Often Wrong, But Never Uncertain Brigade has proposed some new brutally misogynist legislation? And so on. What can you two do to quietly support the causes you believe in, as a form of quiet insurrection, even while they're surrounded by bigots? Can you organize online against racist violence or in support of Black trans people? Can you text bank together or caption protest videos to make them more accessible?

Come to these conversations with some pragmatism, and at least a little good news in your back pocket. Everything is so hard right now, so make sure you’ve got a way to climb back up if you sense that the conversation is more dispiriting than invigorating.

Build up your stuck-at-home friend.

It’s disheartening for a person to hear that their beliefs are foolish, and even worse if they're suffering the brutal chill of knowing that their family thinks they are bad or broken because of, say, their gender or sexual orientation. Marinating in that acid is corrosive to the spirit, so your loved one needs all the restoration you can give. Remind them of times they’ve been effective (they probably feel constantly thwarted now) and/or reasons that you value them in the world. Make them feel as perceptive, competent, and delightful as they are, including by giving them credit for resisting the temptation to hack their parent's Facebook account and change the password to ""R0EvW4DE.""

Should you join their rage-filled roasts of their homophobic parents or racist uncles? Yes, of course, and let me encourage you to use and enjoy these modern versions of Yiddish curses as a gift from my people. But also: Realize that your job for the next little while is also to protect and tend to your person by fluffing them back up.

Dedicate a space in your home to your friend.

This is woo-woo, but I’m not afraid of it if it helps someone. Set up a little area in your house for your friend, perhaps on a sunny windowsill or a small shelf, with a photo of them and something nice, like fruit, flowers, or crystals. Ask for design tips: What do they want their space to look and feel like? Every so often, add a good book, an interesting bit of lichen, a shot of tequila, or whatever else they like and send photos to them.

Tell them that you're keeping a space in the world to represent their joy. Encourage them to visualize entering that space while they’re tuning out another diatribe about Those People (aka, probably everyone you’d both like to have over for brunch). Blow bubbles over it, play it good music, and generally just vibe sweetness really hard over your friend’s space in your house. Send videos of that, too.

Plan—or fantasize about—their escape.

Research strongly indicates that humans crave choices. When we feel like we have no agency, we’re unhappy. It may be that the best thing you can do for a friend who’s suffering is help them plan to bail, even if it feels hard. Weirdly, it might help them hang in safely for longer knowing that there is an option to leave if things become unsustainable.

Offer to help them think through how to scrape up some cash, figure out the route or method by which they might leave, and decide what they'd take with them and how. (Again, if your friend is in actual danger either mentally or physically, go back to the top of this page and find help.)

If they’re more fed up than approaching an emotional breaking point, ask them what they're looking forward to when restrictions lift. Thinking about the future can remind them that this moment isn't forever, and that there will come a time when they're not enduring constant headache-inducing opinions and all the unfortunate feelings and interactions that come with them. This doesn't mean denying or minimizing the fact that their present living situation sucks, to be clear. It just means taking a beat to flip on the light at the end of the tunnel.

Your consistent, positive presence is going to matter more than anything else to a friend who is routinely aggravated or invalidated by their relatives with no immediate way to get away. Just being safe, supportive, and a little mischievous will go a long way toward keeping your person OK enough to return to their regularly scheduled wickedness (supporting unions! working for equity and justice! recycling!) as soon as they possibly can.",,
Go Ahead and Break Up With a Friend During the Pandemic,"I've seen some sentiments going around Twitter over the past few months about how you should be extra patient and non-judgmental with your friends because there's a pandemic… the gist being that people should get a pass on bad behavior right now because everyone is struggling. Do you agree? What if someone is behaving really badly, or selfishly? What if they are taking risks (not wearing a mask, going to house parties, etc.) that put others at risk, or think posting a black square on Instagram constitutes full-throated activism? Even though I know we’re currently in extreme circumstances, I don't think I'll be able to easily forget or forgive how some of my friends have acted or the things they believe are OK. What are your thoughts?

Before you write a friend off, especially a close friend, for behavior that isn’t particularly politically charged, I think it’s worthwhile to go through the exercise of taking the most generous view of this person and whatever they are doing that is annoying you so much. Some things to consider:

The people who have been saying we should be patient with our friends right now aren’t wrong, exactly. Our lives have been upended this year in ways that are fairly unprecedented, and it’s wise to have grace for people you care about who aren’t acting like their 2019 selves. “Not acting like themselves and, in fact, behaving in a way I do not particularly love” here might look like expecting a lot of you, emotionally , complaining constantly, flaking every time you’re supposed to catch up, getting really obsessed with likes and follows , or not being there for you when you need them. It might also look like not wearing a mask or saying derisive things about BLM, but we’ll come back to those situations later.

Before you declare someone you used to be close to toxic and cut all ties, may I also suggest… talking to them about what’s bothering you? You might say something like this:

Maybe you’ll think this through and realize that their behavior isn’t as selfish as it seemed at first glance—that they are doing their best under really difficult and unusual circumstances, and that you’re actually able to muster some empathy for them. Right now, it’s very easy to feel incandescently angry , and to direct your rage at your friends and family instead of, say, the elected officials who keep shitting the bed and failing the people they are supposed to represent over and over and over again.

Being flippant about wearing a mask or avoiding evidence-based coronavirus best practices in favor of one’s own desire to gather with 30 family members indoors every weekend isn’t the same as not always asking you how you’re doing during hangouts. Similarly, being wishy-washy about Black lives and police brutality isn’t something that all of us can “agree to disagree” on. While I’m very hesitant to call mask-wearing or the belief that Black lives matter “political,” it’s clear that both of these things—or, really, the absence of them—reveal something deeper about who we are. The things you want your friends to do better this year, LW, are rooted in your values, which is why it’s not outrageous to want to end friendships over them.

Most of us have dealbreakers when it comes to friendships, even if we’re not conscious of them all the time, or during “normal” times. I think it’s been easy for a lot of people—particularly in a culture where talking about “politics” makes a lot of folks uncomfortable and where “agree to disagree” reins supreme—to ignore or downplay the unsavory or even shitty beliefs of people they otherwise like. The events of this year have made waving these traits away a lot more difficult for a lot of people.

In general, you don’t need a “good” reason to break up with anyone—a friend or a romantic partner. If you don’t actually like someone all that much (or get the sense that they don’t like you very much), dread hanging out with them, feel mismatched in terms of interest, or constantly find yourself wishing they were different in rather significant ways, you should pay attention to those signs. If a friend suddenly starts being really nasty to you, or sends you a long letter outlining all the ways you’ve failed them over the years , it’s totally reasonable to just be like, Okey dokey, I think this thing has run its course!

Our values inform so much about our lives; they influence our priorities and decisions and how we spend our time, money, and energy. They play a huge role in where we live and go to school and the jobs we do, and in who we date/fuck/marry. If you feel really strongly about something—whether that’s wearing a mask or, at the other end of the spectrum, not wearing a mask—it’s perfectly reasonable to not want to invest in or rely on people who don’t share your deeply-held beliefs.

Do I think you should make the decision to end a friendship based solely on what you see on Instagram, without ever talking to the person again? Eh… it depends. If they aren’t a terribly close friend and the stakes are low—i.e., if you’re looking for permission to simply mute or unfriend them and move on with your life—I think it’s probably fine. If we’re talking about a closer friend, it’s probably worth seeking out a little more information before you blow it all up. Maybe you’ll discover that they and their 30 family members isolated for two weeks before the indoor birthday party or something. I don’t know if those details will change how you feel, but I don’t think it’s a bad idea to try to get more context before you totally write them off.

Of course, doing this might actually require a hard conversation, which I know no one likes to have. A lot of people would prefer to slowly ghost people, or claim they’re “sooo busy” instead of just saying, “Yeah, what was up with that party with your family? Based on your posts, it looked kind of risky, and I was kind of surprised because it’s so at odds with how I’ve been behaving during this pandemic.” If you don’t think it’s worth it, or you have a ton of evidence at this point that this person does not share your values, or you’re dealing with something wildly inflammatory where one post was all you needed to see, tapping out makes sense. But if you are feeling generous, I do think a little patience and curiosity here can be worth it.",,
"If You Miss Your Casual Friendships, Consider Starting a House Party Slack","I've kept in close and regular touch with my very best friends throughout the pandemic, but as it looks increasingly endless, I'm really missing having more casual friends and, especially, a friend group where those more casual friends pleasantly drop into different social scenarios from time to time. I'm also bummed about the new friendships I was making pre-pandemic that didn't quite get to a level of regular texting/otherwise being in touch and that now feel indefinitely put on hold! I love my main people, but I miss big, messy, fun group conversations and the getting-to-know-you excitement of talking to new people. What do I do about my stagnant-feeling social life? Are there any ways to rekindle it, outside of (or even including!) the people who are already in it?

To revive these connections, you could try to stay in better touch with your C-tier friends and the new-ish pals who you aren’t going to bubble with but still very much like, and who you hope to hang out with in a year or so when we re-enter society. That might look like texting them directly regularly; switching to a more asynchronous medium like email; or working them into your Google Hangouts rotation every few weeks… all while attempting to communicate “I’m not trying to make you my BFF, I swear, and I totally understand if you aren’t up for this because we all have a lot going on right now.” If any of that feels right to you and the kind of thing your social circle would be into, I say: Go for it!

We’ve been in our new pandemic reality for several months now, and have presumably started to collectively get the hang of things like “ having priorities ” and “ enforcing boundaries. ” While that is, broadly, a really good thing, staying home as much as possible and limiting ourselves to just a few (if any!) contacts outside our households isn’t without consequences. When we shrink our lives down to bubbles and pods (or just “a few very close friends”), we lose access to our “weak ties”—that is, the low-stakes casual friendships that research shows are ultimately good for our well-being .

This is a question I think a lot of people will relate to! The topic has certainly been on my mind since the recent tweet about “missing my C-tier friends” from Alanna Okun (who happens to be an A-tier friend of mine!) and during the subsequent conversation about pandemic FOMO .

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how there are certain conversations that feel a little too private (or too mundane) for public social media channels, but aren’t so intimate that they need to be reserved for only your closest friends. You’re probably not going into great detail on Instagram or Twitter about all the things you’re buying online, or the latest installment of “my incredibly demanding boss has once again behaved badly,” or the semi-embarrassing but also very funny thing your partner said recently… but you’d totally share this stuff with casual friends at a party because it’s low-stakes, light, gossipy, and easy to contextualize in person/when talking to a specific audience. It’s ultimately personal but not private.

A house party Slack, which is a term I just made up, is one in which you (or whichever person in your social circle is the one who throws the best/frequent house parties) simply creates new Slack workspace and then invite all of the people you’d normally invite to a house party—which likely includes some C-tier friends, some new-ish friends, some friends-of-friends, etc. It’s a place for chill, water cooler–esque conversation between people who loosely know each other but aren’t necessarily close.

(You could also definitely create a house party Discord , if you prefer! One benefit of Slack is that a lot of people already use it for work, so they’ll just be adding a new “space” to their existing app. But you should do whatever feels right for you and your friends.)

If you’re not familiar with Slack , it’s a workplace messaging app that has chat rooms and DMs (both of which are only accessible to people invited to your specific “workspace”). Because anyone can create a free Slack workspace and invite whomever they want, it’s become increasingly popular with non-work groups and communities—like, say, likeminded listeners of a particular podcast, grad students in the same program, small friend groups, even families .

It’s also, importantly, built for big group conversations. The threading functionality, customizable notifications, and ability to create new channels for different subjects make it much easier to stay on top of conversations (or to opt out of them, if you prefer). All of this, plus the ability to DM, means that people can chat about whatever is on their mind without monopolizing the entire group… and, much like at a big group hangout, others can float in or out as they please. And because a lot of people already use Slack for work, they’ll simply be adding a new workspace to their existing app, making it much easier to type in during the day (or really, whenever) than a group chat that may be restricted to thumb typing.

First, texting allows a level of access and intimacy that just isn’t the right match for ongoing casual chit chat with casual friends. As therapist Andrea Bonior writes in her book The Friendship Fix , “texting lets us place something—immediately—into someone else’s consciousness, whether they want it there, and are adequately prepared to deal with it right at that moment, or not.” A group text with 10–40 people would lead to notification overload fairly quickly. After a couple of dumb ill-timed memes or rants, most people are simply going to mute the group text and forget about it. Even if it’s not muted, it’s still going to be kind of a mess and not very fun. Slack is fun!

Using tech tools to “hack” friendships is a bit controversial , and you might be thinking, “Why not just start a group text?” That is a fair question! But I—a person who, in case it’s not clear, is not being paid by Slack to say any of this—feel very strongly that Slack is the preferable medium for this kind of thing.

With Slack, you can also be very clearly online or offline, and can set a status (basically an away message, which texting famously does not have). All of this lowers the expectation of an immediate response, which makes it easier to feel OK about adding another thing to your busy life. And the responsibility of participating and replying is shared by many—meaning individuals don’t feel as much pressure to be There and On all the time. Again, this is more in line with what you’d experience at an actual house party: sometimes you’re yelling loudly in the center of the room, sometimes you’re quietly listening, and sometimes people aren’t sure where you are but they know you’re around somewhere.

I also like that a Slack workspace, unlike a group text, has a clear and distinct host. It’s important to have one person who is in charge, and who can make decisions about who is invited or not, who can step in should any drama arise, etc. As a big believer in Priya Parker’s “don’t be a chill host” rule for gatherings, I would much rather be in a group conversation where the person in charge is clearly designated and aware of their role.

There is, of course, the possibility that a friend of yours who also loves throwing house parties will decide to do this at the exact same time you were planning to do it. What a nice problem in a year filled with Pretty Bad Problems! I think you can deal with this the same way you’d handle it if you were both trying to throw a party the same night. Make your workspace different in some way (by making it about a specific topic or making sure at least half the participants are different from those in the other group); agree to co-host; or simply be willing to be a guest in their house party Slack instead of hosting your own.",,
'Why Do I Always Want to Bail on Plans With My Friends?',"Why Am I Like This? How to actually stop doing the things you know aren't exactly good for you. See More →

There’s a palpable relief that comes from canceling plans you’re no longer in the mood for. Part of that is the knowledge that you won’t have to make the effort to do whatever the planned thing is: put on the outfit, figure out the transportation, make small talk with someone’s annoying partner, figure out how to split the bill. Even though Zoom hangouts or phone calls should, in theory, offset some of this dread, not even a pandemic can eradicate the temptation to bail on friends at the last minute.

“Canceling plans is something many people really like to do,” Johanna Jarcho, an assistant professor of psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia, told VICE. “It provides a lot of relief for people.”

But even people who love their alone time need some social interaction, and often end up feeling lighter and more connected after quality time spent with pals, whether it’s in person or via a video call. That’s because authentic social connection is beneficial to our health and well-being. Still, as a scheduled event nears, that dread can start to creep in. If you’re often tempted to bail on the friends who you really like and always have a good time with, here are a few things that might be going on.

You're saying yes without taking the time to fully consider the invitation.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, around 7.1 percent of adults in the U.S. suffer from social anxiety disorder. One surprising way that low-level social anxiety can manifest, according to Jarcho, is in immediately agreeing to do something without taking the time to properly evaluate the ask, and not suggesting a different, more desirable plan when necessary. This is a form of conflict avoidance; agreeing to proposed plans is easier in the moment than figuring out a better option for everyone—until the time comes to actually act on those plans.

“For some people, the default answer to things is ‘yes,’ with little consideration given to the logistics,” Ric Mathews, a New York–based psychotherapist and mental health counselor, told VICE. “This is a sign that they may have issues with setting boundaries. Learning to say no can sometimes be hard. It may require some reflection and investigation. But once you do, it's actually easier to commit to plans, and to feel good about those choices. It can be quite liberating.”

Communicating your needs—and also being supportive when your friends communicate theirs—will improve time spent socializing for everyone involved. “Suggesting alternative plans that are more convenient could help you feel less social pressure while keeping the relationships strong,” Mathews said.

You’re stressed about utilizing your time in the “best” way possible.

It’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to optimize your life—to attempt to plan your days, nights, and weekends perfectly. “It can be a product of FOMO,” Mathews said. “Some people tend to agree to a lot of things, and overbook themselves in the hopes that having all the options available will give them more opportunity to have the ‘best’ time.” But, of course, you can’t possibly do everything, so backing out of something is often the only way to actually manage your time.

Additionally, if you feel like you’re always busy, time alone to read (ahem, scroll Twitter and Instagram) or just sit quietly can feel like a compelling need—one that’s potentially more valuable than socialization. And, surprise: that perspective is actually totally valid. “People are pretty overscheduled, and the idea of just having some time to oneself is really important,” Jarcho explained. “Time alone can be very regenerative and important, whether you’re an introvert or not.”

It’s also worth noting that people who mostly identify as introverts, but who have jobs that require them to be more extroverted often find themselves putting in a lot of extra effort in order to thrive professionally. “When it comes to making or keeping social plans, they have a hard time finding the energy to do so. They’re actually feeling like they’re in self-preservation mode outside of work,” Mathews explained.

You're not good at predicting how much you’ll enjoy the hangout.

In psychological literature there’s something called affective forecasting which shows that humans tend to fare poorly at predicting how we are going to feel in the future—and often totally misjudge what will make us happy. Ergo, it’s easy to forget, when you’re sitting in your apartment in your Soffe shorts and TV on the Radio T-shirt, how much real, authentic enjoyment you will get out of putting on real clothes and meeting up with friends in the park.

“Humans are frequently very bad at predicting what an experience will be like once they arrive somewhere,” Marlone Henderson, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin told VICE. “Particularly when it has to do with emotional things. What we predict in our heads often just doesn’t map onto what it will be like when we experience it in reality.”

You’re low-key influenced by popular introvert memes.

We’ve all seen them: the “sorry I’m late, I didn’t want to come” jokes on Instagram and the tweets about how good it feels to cancel plans. “When it comes to cultural trends, introverts are winning for sure,” says Jarcho.

In social psychology, this is known as the concept of conformity—a change in behavior in response to real or imagined social pressure. Conformity isn’t always a bad thing; this type of content can certainly make people feel better about tending to their mental health, or going out less during a pandemic. But it can have negative consequences too—like if you’re subtly encouraged to isolate yourself more than you would otherwise, or to stop tending to important friendships.

“These images, even if they’re not necessarily accurate depictions of reality, sink into our consciousness. You see people reposting memes about ditching plans, and all of a sudden that feels normative and like what most people are doing,” Henderson said. “So when you’re debating, ‘I could go out or I could stay in…’ you have all of this information that suggests that the right thing to do culturally is to stay in and chill.”

You’re out of the habit.

When we stop doing anything routine for an extended period of time, picking it up again becomes much more effortful—whether it’s running in the mornings, calling your parents, or eating veggies every day. And it’s no different with socializing. “As we grow older, we don’t have regular interactions in the way that we used to,” Jarcho explained.“When we were younger, many of us had consistent, habitual interactions—like going out every Friday night.”

The infrequency of your hangouts (or any social activity) means it’s a bigger deal (i.e., requiring more effort) when you do decide to socialize. And the lack of recent memories of having fun socializing in person or on Zoom can affect your “Should I bail?” decision-making process.

“As you’re planning your future, you’re looking at your past to guide you about what you will find most enjoyable,” Jarcho said. But the repetition and frequency of some memories trump others—so if you’re sitting around reading or watching TV more often than you’re talking to friends, you might start to associate staying in with a more positive experience.

Your personal values are changing.

Human connection is important throughout our lives—psychologists refer to this simply as the “need to belong.” That need has to be addressed one way or another—whether through family ties, romantic relationships, or friendships. But there’s a lot of variety in terms of how much and in what ways we need to belong in order to feel satisfied. The amount and degree of social interaction people require at a baseline level varies from person to person, and shifts and evolves as we progress through different stages in our lives.

“Some people only need a small circle to feel truly whole and connected, and some people need more,” explained Henderson. “Whatever that comfort level is, there are times in life where people feel satisfied with their circles, and others when people feel more vulnerable and have a greater need to hang out with friends more often.” For example, your vulnerability level—and desire to hang out with friends—is typically high right after you’ve been through a breakup.

“Circumstances arise that may drive someone further in either the extroverted or introverted direction,” Mathews said. “People's priorities shift in response to what matters to them, and what matters to them changes over time.”

If you’re thinking of canceling plans with friends, a good question to ask yourself is what, specifically, you’ll do with your time if you don’t attend this particular hangout. “Declining invitations might mean you’re deciding to put energy and focus into building a family, educational pursuits, self-care, or spirituality,” explained Mathews. “It's an error to equate declining to hang out with friends as a lack of interest about or care for those friendships. Most people will have periods of time where other things need to come first. Understanding that shows empathy.”

You’re in denial about the state of your friendship.

While not wanting to hang out with friends doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t care about them, it could also be the case that this relationship isn’t actually bringing you joy and connection anymore—and you’re having a difficult time getting out of it. “There are friends that are still your ‘friend’ out of habit, but every time you hang out with them, it isn’t great,” Jarcho said. “It’s hard to have a difficult conversation where you break up the friendship; it’s easier to just go along with plans that you’re not super into.” If you find yourself consistently dreading a hangout with one particular person—or feeling drained or annoyed afterward—it might mean that you’ve outgrown the relationship. If your friendship has reached its expiration date, it may be time to break up.

You’re actually not doing great, mental health–wise.

If you find yourself consistently and uncharacteristically dreading and avoiding interaction with your favorite people for a sustained period of time, it may be beneficial to talk to a professional, just to get some perspective.

“Everyone feels depressed or socially anxious from time to time,” Jarcho said. But, there are certain signs to watch for that can indicate your behavior might be cause for concern. “The critical parts to be concerned about are three-fold: the timeline; the chronicity—how consistent the feeling is; and the impairment—are the symptoms impacting your life in an undesirable way?” she said.

By these measures, a diagnosis of social anxiety is indicated by six months of intense and consistent fear or anxiety when it comes to social situations. A diagnosis of depression, on the other hand, is indicated by two weeks of “feeling a lack of pleasure in almost all activities most of the day, nearly every day” coupled with other noticeable changes in appetite, sleep patterns, energy, and capacity to make decisions.

Of course, not wanting to hang out with your pals for a few weeks doesn’t necessarily mean you are experiencing depression or social anxiety disorder. Jarcho said that the signs listed above could also be related to alcohol, drugs, medication, or an undiagnosed medical condition. And living through a pandemic isn’t exactly fun. But that’s all the more reason to talk to a healthcare provider at some point.",,
How to Talk to a Friend Whose Posts Have You Worried,"Still, it can be hard to know the best response when jokes and cries for help sound so similar, and that’s especially true when someone is posting in a public forum. You might feel nervous you’ll say the wrong thing, or don’t want to be seen as overreacting to a post that they didn’t mean for anyone to take too seriously. You might also wonder if it’s really your place to say something, or assume their other friends have it covered, or worry about misjudging the friendship and implying a level of intimacy that they (or you!) aren’t necessarily feeling.

Even before the coronavirus pandemic began, a lot of people were talking more honestly about their bad mental health days (or weeks, or months) online. And now that we’re experiencing widespread loneliness , unemployment , uncertainty, illness, and grief—during a time when our lives have become increasingly virtual—it makes sense that a lot of us are seeing more posts like this in our feeds.

Hard to Say is a column about delicate situations and difficult conversations, for people who wish they could hire a ghostwriter for all their texts.

It’s also a good idea to have the conversation in private. “Go to the DMs or send them a text,” therapist Ryan Howes, author of Mental Health Journal for Men: Creative Prompts, Practices, and Exercises to Bolster Wellness , told VICE. “And say, ‘Hey, just checking in; I want to make sure you’re doing OK,’ or something like that.”

“There’s not necessarily going to be some magic elixir of words that are going to be so inspirational that they help the person feel better,” she said. “What’s important is the sense of connection, the sense of empathy, the sense of, Hey, I’m going to bear witness to what you’re going through and be there for you.”

“We often stress about the perfect thing to say,” Bonior told VICE. “When in reality it’s the ‘being there.’” She suggested reaching out in a way that shows you’re willing to listen; you could say something like, “Hey, I’m sorry to hear you’re struggling; I’m here if you want to talk.”

Still, there’s definitely more you can do that simply hitting the frowny-face reaction button and moving on with your day. Here are some tips to keep in mind.

“Since so many of us are communicating digitally so much more, and since there's less ability to be with each other physically, I think we see a lot more confusion about exactly how people are doing,” said Andrea Bonior , a therapist and the author of Detox Your Thoughts: Quit Negative Self-Talk for Good and Discover the Life You've Always Wanted . “We don't have that grounding presence of being able to touch the person on the arm and look in their eye, and it gets confusing.”

You might expect a friend who is super vocal about something on the Internet to mention it a lot when you chat with them directly, but that definitely isn’t always the case. “I see that a lot,” Bonior said. “There's people who, you know, cultivate a different persona online in all kinds of ways. And one of those ways might be, ‘I'm emoting about mental health issues that I wouldn't necessarily actually talk about in person.’”

Regardless of how well you know the person, Bonior said it’s important not to communicate a level of support you can’t actually offer. In that case, you might opt to say something like “Just wanted to let you know that I’m thinking of you” instead of, “I’m here if you want to talk.”

“It’s up to you to decide,” she continued. “And part of it depends on how severely they seem to be hurting, and then on how much other support they seem to be getting.”

“The first question to ask yourself is, ‘What is my endgame here?’” Bonior said. “‘Am I willing to get into a more personal thing with them where I initiate direct individual contact, and [take on] everything that comes from that? Or do I feel like I want to be part of a crowd of people who says something supportive, but I’m not going to be in the inner circle?’”

If the person posting is, say, a former co-worker or friend from high school who you don’t have much of a relationship with, you might not be sure if it’s your place to get involved—or you might not want to set an expectation that you’ll be able to lend an ear frequently.

If it’s pretty clear they aren’t doing great, you might want to avoid leading with “How are you?” (Answer: Not great, Bob! ) Howes suggested using “I” statements instead. “You can say, ‘I’m concerned about you; is there anything I can do for you?’ That takes them out of their self for a second, like, Oh, that’s how I’m being perceived by the outside world—you’re concerned about me,” he said.

You could be forgiven for looking at someone’s post and wondering, Are they depressed or are they just Extremely Online? When tweets and memes about topics like dissociation and even wanting to die regularly rack up hundreds of shares, it’s not always totally evident how serious the person posting is.

“If they kind of brush that off during Zoom, then I think you go back with a text message or a DM later on and be like, ‘Hey, I am concerned about you,’” he said.

“You're kind of breaking through the shame by putting your own stuff out there, and inviting them to do the same,” he continued. “And they can take you up on that or not. But least you've kind of laid the groundwork: ‘We're here and we're talking about our mental health. Would you like to join us?’”

Still, be prepared that they might feel a bit vulnerable or exposed when you bring the topic up face to face. “I would actually suggest maybe leading with your own stuff [in that instance],” Howes said. “‘This has been a hard time, [X] has been stressing me out, [X] has been difficult.’ And then maybe say, ‘And I saw that you've been stressed too—how are you doing?’”

That said, try not to stress about whether it’s OK to mention a person’s tweets during a phone chat or Zoom hangout with them. It’s not weird or creepy to admit that you saw something that was posted for an audience that includes you. At a certain point, not admitting to seeing it is weirder, and can imply that being honest about mental health issues is bad or wrong.

“It's hard to know sometimes if it's a joke, or if it's a cry for help, or, you know, maybe both,” Howes said. “I don't think it's harmful to make that sort of an inquiry: I'm concerned; is there anything I can do? I think it's just going to show that you care. And maybe they'll, at worst, say, ‘Oh, no, you're overreacting.’ Fine. You're better safe than sorry.”

Bonior agreed. “I always would say, err on the side of caution,” she said. “As embarrassing or weird as it might feel to overreact to something, it's far less devastating than to underreact. The stakes of [overreacting] are not nearly as high as what's much more common, which is people are putting stuff out there, and nobody's really taking it seriously.”

“What a lot of people do is throw out feelers,” she continued. “And they want to see if someone takes them seriously. And if everybody assumes that they're just blowing off steam, then it's like, Well, nobody really wants to listen.”

One thing to consider: is this out of character for them? “Is this something that's out of the blue, out of the norm for them? Are they using language that seems different than what they would usually use?” Howes said. If so, that’s even more cause for concern.

In an “lol but actually” situation, Bonior suggested saying something like this: “Hey, I’m not exactly sure what you meant by this, but when I hear people I care about talking that way, I get concerned, so I wanted to check in. You might have just been kidding around or blowing off steam, but if you are having these thoughts, or if you are feeling really helpless, I want you to know you can talk to me about it.”

"How to Handle a Demanding, Lonely Friend","How to Stay In is a series about redefining ""normal"" life in order to take care of ourselves and one another during the COVID-19 pandemic. See More →

Although small outdoor gatherings and some indoor workplaces are accessible to more people now, many people continue to struggle with maintaining regular social connections, and with loneliness. In theory, when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic, we’re all in this together. But any two (or more!) friends may have wildly different priorities, needs, and stressors in their daily lives during this time—not to mention differences about the practicalities of keeping in touch, like safety concerns, living arrangements, and time constraints.

Some people have truly been alone while sheltering-in-place, whereas others may have been living in crowded quarters with others all this time and still feel lonely. Many of our friends are likely going through painful or difficult times, given the scope of the virus and the economic disaster it's caused. Those people might need a lot of engagement from their support networks right now—or need a lot less expected of them, friendship-wise, for the time being.

When close friends have incompatible approaches to how (or how often) they want to connect, things can get complicated quickly—it can be especially hard to strike the balance between taking care of your own needs versus supporting your friends in theirs, especially if they're constantly pushing to meet up in person, expecting you to drop everything to respond to a text because ""we have so much time on our hands right now,"" or otherwise asking more of you than you're able to give.

Here are some steps to protect your friendship—and your well-being—on constantly changing social terrain, especially when some friends are lonely and cooped-up after months of sheltering-in-place and may be acting really needy with you.

Figure out your boundaries and stick to them.

Boundaries are a crucial way of protecting your emotional health. We can look at them as limits that we set and stick to, that help set expectations for what works for us within relationships. Think about what boundaries will be most helpful for you in particular: If you're not able to spend time together in person, think about how to allocate time for your friend at home without wearing yourself out. Maybe texting is fine, but you can’t spare time for a phone call without advanced planning. Maybe you need weekends free for your family (or yourself), or you need to focus during the workday, or you just can’t deal with late-night messages anymore.

Remind yourself of your reasoning, and the bigger picture of why you have chosen particular limits. You may have different values, beliefs, or needs than your friend does—which means you have every right to make different decisions than your friend might. The more that you feel firm in deciding what's best for you, the less you will waver when expressing these limits to your friend—and the less tempted they will be to try to pressure you.

Don't let guilt take over.

So often, when a person in our life is hurting, we feel guilty for telling them what we need in order to be good to both ourselves and to them—like setting boundaries makes us a bad friend, or is inherently selfish. But let’s say that you deplete yourself over and over again, by losing sleep for late-night phone calls you didn’t have energy for, or saying “yes” to in-person gatherings that didn’t feel safe to you. It’s likely you’ll grow resentful and disconnected, which doesn’t do your friends any favors, either. And if you constantly flip-flop on your boundaries, your friends don’t know what to expect—which is frustrating and stressful.

Be direct about when and how you can be there for your friends.

If your friend is needing more and more from you, and you're just not able to give as much as they're hoping, it's helpful to be upfront. Carve out the time that you can spend and how you can spend it. Plan it in advance, like, “I’m sorry, I’m going to be too slammed at work this week to text much during the day, but can we plan on a phone call on Wednesday?” The more your friend knows what to expect, the less let down they’ll be, the less pressured you’ll feel, and the more they have to look forward to. Sometimes, though, a friend will push back, and perhaps make you feel guilty in the process. Remember: kind but firm. “I’m so sorry—I’m still slammed at work, like I had mentioned, so I can’t talk now, but does Wednesday still work for you? I’ve been really looking forward to it.”

The more clearly you spell things out for yourself, the better you can express your limits in a kind way—and stick to them. Of course, as regulations and advice change in terms of the safety of various interactions, you can reserve the right to adjust your boundaries with the new information. But it’s important to make sure that if a boundary is being adjusted, it’s because you’ve chosen to adjust it—not because you felt pressured. You can make this process easier for yourself and your friends by being honest with yourself about your motivations for doing something differently, and continuing to communicate your limits clearly as they are re-established.

Let empathy rule.

Attitudes about what social interaction should look like vary widely right now, so differences of opinion are practically unavoidable. Navigating those differences will always go more smoothly if you express empathy.

If a friend has planned an in-person gathering that you’d rather not attend, start with validating what they’re after in the first place, even though you’re saying no: “I know you must be so sick of being holed up, and tired of being disconnected. I really get it. But I’m just not personally ready for this yet.”

You may never totally know where your friend is coming from, and that’s OK. Even when simply listening to a friend vent, empathy goes a long way toward strengthening your connection. Saying “I can imagine that is really frustrating,” or, “That sounds so hard. I’m really sorry to hear it.” can help your friend feel understood—even when you don’t have the answers for how to make things better.

If there’s conflict between you and a friend, try not to be too quick to place blame on them—or on yourself. None of us can ever be completely objective about our roles within certain interactions and relationships, because we all have subtle biases in terms of how we justify certain actions, or how much we are bothered by certain behaviors. If your friend snaps at you when you miss a text from them, for instance, remind yourself that their hurt or stress affects how they see things—and extend compassion to both of you.

You can’t know exactly what your friend is going through, but the more you try to understand their emotional experience, the more your responses will be grounded in kindness and caring—and help keep you connected.

Use a couples-therapy trick.

Conversations with friends right now may feel difficult; it’s natural to be uncomfortable when emotions are complicated. It takes vulnerability to express that you don’t agree with someone, or that someone is making you feel upset, especially when you care about that person. But that makes those conversations all the more important. In these situations, it’s helpful to default to “I” statements—ones that start with your own feelings, expressed calmly and openly.

For example: “I was hurt when you suggested I wasn’t there for you,” or, “I sometimes worry about your getting mad at me if I don’t respond right away, and it makes me stressed,” can be the opener to a respectful conversation. “You lash out at me too much” or “You need to check yourself,” on the other hand, are prone to disconnecting the two of you from the get-go, with the other person immediately forced to defend their own behavior, taking their attention away from being able to understand where you are coming from.

Get creative.

Stressors in friendships can be similar to those in romantic relationships: feeling like you're in a rut, where neither of you are very interested in what the other has to say because your interactions have grown too predictable. And, if your friend is feeling lonely or disconnected from you, they would likely feel appreciative if you suggest an activity that brings a little novelty and also helps re-establish a sense of positivity and appreciation within the friendship. Why not send something funny in the mail? Surprise them with an old photo over text? Start a mini book club together? Suggest you both watch a tutorial for the most bizarre hobby you can find on YouTube (soap carving, anyone)?

Your friend became your friend for a reason; the fact that one of you is lonely doesn't change that. You likely know them well enough to think specifically about what can bring them some joy—and offer some consistency and closeness in a time when things can feel so unpredictable and fast-paced. Keeping up with unprecedented social circumstances within our personal lives and friendships is practically and emotionally taxing—but we can find new, and grounding, ways to show up for one another and ourselves by being empathetic and forthright as we go.",,
How to Make More LGBTQ Friends,"I was already a pretty butch little queer, with a gender expression that was tilted heavily to masculine, which tended to make new groups awkward—I often had to start by discussing whether I was a boy or a girl, which was basically the opposite of welcoming. But at BAGLY people immediately greeted me, made a space on an incredibly ratty sofa, asked my name, and offered theirs. It felt like I’d always heard coming home described, but had never experienced.

I’ll never forget being 15 years old and walking into my first ever meeting for lesbian, gay, bi, queer, and trans youth at BAGLY in Boston. The meetings were held in a church basement back then, and I had never been in a room full of just LGBT2Q people before in my queer little life.

On the other hand, this leaves lot of queer people in the same boat. Likeminded people are out there—they exist in both physical and digital space, and you can make friends, build community, and be in the mix with each other. Here are some strategies and options for finding, and connecting with, your people.

This queer problem is compounded by the fact that making friends gets harder and harder as we reach adulthood. Researcher Jeffrey Hall estimated that it takes 40–60 hours of time spent together to make a casual friend, and 200+ hours for a close friend . In school or at work or in a house of worship, it’s fairly easy to rack up 200 hours with someone without even trying very hard. But depending where you do those things, you may find queers thin on the ground. A queer TV show or novel or even a hookup are great ways to get some queer validation, but none is going to bring you soup when you’re sick or listen to your breakup-makeup-breakup woes.

But as gay bars and bookstores are closing left and right, many of us have turned to apps to fill that gap, meaning we spend more time than ever alone in our rooms. Meanwhile, the passage of time means many of us will age out of queer youth groups sooner or later. Even before the coronavirus pandemic made meeting new people in person basically impossible, queers and transfolk were still struggling with loneliness . As our in-person meeting places dwindle out of existence, lots of LGBT2Q folks are going to have a harder time finding community in person (or in a specific, one-to-one way online).

So often, LGBT2Q people find that as we leave our homes and venture into the world as out, independent humans, we’re searching for that sense of welcome, and for connections to our culture(s). Even those of us with accepting parents or supportive straight friends can’t always turn to them for advice on queer dating or sexuality, for help with trans-related questions about navigating a hostile world, or even just for things like outfit guidance. (“Mom, is a thong good for a foam party? What do you think of this crop top to go with?”) The close queer friends we make become a chosen family, with a shared culture and identity, forming the bonds that are essential to our wellness and growth.

If you’re religious in almost any way, there are queer and trans people who are worshipping in the same or similar ways. That may be surprising news if you’ve been raised in a homophobic branch of your religious tradition, but I promise you—they’re out there, and they can’t wait to welcome you (and you may find it really healing to bring your whole self to your faith tradition). Here are some links to lists of affirming (that’s the religious buzzword for “we like the gays here”) organizations:

Colleges, universities, bookstores, and libraries typically bring amazing LGBT2Q artists, writers, cultural workers, and other smartypantses to give talks and performances, almost all of which are free, open to the public, and held in buildings that are at least somewhat accessible to disabled people. Get on the email list for your local independent bookstore, library branch, and any college or university LGBT2Q resource center within your comfortable travel range, and go see them (once it becomes safe to do so, of course). Then, afterward, strike up a conversation with someone who just watched the same thing you did and ask what they thought about it! Note: if you’re not sure who to talk to, look for the smokers, who are accustomed to casually chatting with other people smoking. (You don’t have to smoke in order to chat—just stay upwind. And please don’t start smoking just to make new friends.)

Not sure where to start? Try #QueerStyle, #BlackTransExcellence, #QueerFemme, #LesbianMemes, #BiLove, #GenderEuphoria, #Gaysian, #LGBTTikTok. Or, add your identity to your state, school, or profession to find #GayMichigan or #QueerMorehouse or #TransUtah or #PansexualUK and more.

Instagram and Twitter make it easier to find other people with the same interests, whether it’s hedgehogs or aerosol art, and there are so many homo-tastic hashtags. When you find someone you’re excited to follow because their posts indicate that you share interests or identities, maybe try a DM? Don’t be creepy, be curious: “Hi, just wanted to say I really like your look/art/politics/cakes. Have you ever worked with eyelashes/watercolours/anti-carceral feminism/pie?”

Making new friends may sometimes require being able to make a guess about who’s “family,” so start by unpacking your assumptions about who that could be. LGBT2Q people exist in all genders, in all cultures, and relying on your gaydar is a good start, but expanding your queer and trans cultural references will boost your abilities. (Are you clocking that Big Freedia or Prancing Elites T-shirt as much as a Madonna one? Are you seeing the femmes that cross your path rocking leather accessories or that extra helping of glitter?) Don’t rely on mixed-up gender cues to do all the work for you, but when you see people that might be Your People, make the effort to say hello and keep saying hello. It might feel awkward the first few times, but that’s a muscle you can build. Remember: so many LGBT2Q folks are looking for connection, just like you, and many of them will be legit excited that you introduced yourself, or asked for their number, or followed them on Insta, or sent that text or suggested that coffee.

(Before we go though, consider Step Zero: Make a safety plan . It’s great to make new friends, online and in person, but if you’re planning to meet someone who’s still basically a stranger one-on-one, it’s wise to borrow a page from sex worker wisdom and meet in a public place first, let someone else know where you’re going, with whom, and when you expect to be home. You might also consider arranging a safety call—i.e., if they don’t hear from you by a certain time to say you’re safe, they’ll call/text you, and if they cannot get a reply they’ll start looking for you. And on that note: please be extra careful as you plan which of these options you can action now, during the coronavirus pandemic. Follow the guidance of your regional public health officials, wear a mask, wash your hands, check on your neighbors, and stay as safe as you can, please—even if that means waiting a few months to put these tips into practice. OK, now, onto the fun stuff!)

And there are many more! Bonus: Many religious traditions explicitly value welcoming a stranger, so if you show up a couple of times you won’t be a stranger for long.

5. Be out and about.

Did you know that there are a lot of LGBT2Q outdoor activity groups? You can bike, hike, scuba dive, camp, canoe, summit, forage, and otherwise enjoy the great outdoors in queer company for sociability (and safety, too). Check out Unlikely Hikers, which specifically welcomes and celebrates people who don’t fit the classic Patagonia profile including fat folks and hikers of colour; Venture Out Project, which is run by and explicitly welcomes trans people; Gay SCUBA Week and Queer Paddlers; and basically what I’m saying is that if you want to be out and Out there are definitely other ‘mos to do it with in your area. Also, know what’s great for making friends? A campfire.

6. Host an open house.

Offering hospitality is a great way to create community, and it doesn’t have to be fancy. You can make it a potluck in the grand lesbian tradition, serve a coffee and doughnuts brunch, put a pot of soup or chili on and let people bring their own bowl and spoon, or whatever suits your space and style. Some tips to get you started:

Do it monthly. People will get into the habit of stopping by on the second Tuesday (or whenever) for some queer companionship.

Ask to be listed in your local LGBT2Q event publication, and let people email you for the address so you can vet them a little first.

Have a theme or discussion topic! It could be as festive as “Beach Party” or as serious as a reading group about dismantling white supremacy, depending on how you like to spend your time.

Know that it might take a few invitations for people you don’t know well to be convinced that it’s really OK to accept your hospitality. Go to lots of events and keep inviting the people you meet and like to your gathering. Try: “Hey, I host an open house brunch on the fourth Sunday of the month for anyone in the LGBT2Q community. It’s low-key and very relaxed. Come have waffles and meet some people!” And follow up with them one time closer to the date so they know you’d really like to see them there and weren’t just being polite.

7. Find the Gay-mers.

Board game cafes are taking off worldwide, and many have specific nights set aside for LGBT2Q participants. They tend to be quiet, well-lit, sober or sober-friendly, and give participants a lot of time to chat and get to know one another. Bust out your Scrabble dictionary or your Dungeons and Dragons dice and go make friends with the other board game nerds enthusiasts. (And if you’re playing Set, please invite me; I love that game.)

8. Serve what you value.

There are few better ways to make friends as an adult than to volunteer your time. Go to the meetings of whatever local organization puts on the events you enjoy, and join a crew or committee that matches your skills. If there’s a specifically LGBT2Q org, that’s ideal, but also look at artistic and cultural groups where you see visibly queer people in attendance often.

Community groups always need more people to set up, clean up, drive people and stuff around, put up posters and all sorts of other tasks. Can you bake cupcakes? Balance the budget and keep the books? Collect money at the door? Are you a street medic or have skills in mental health first aid? Can you moderate a Facebook page or keep the social media feeds fresh? Whatever you can do is definitely needed somewhere, and then you’ll meet other volunteers. Yay, friends!

(This is also a great way to access sometimes-expensive events for free—many organizations have volunteer programs that provide tickets or entry with a few hours of work!)

9. In recovery? Find a meeting that meets your needs.

There are hundreds of LGBT2Q-focused recovery meetings in the world, including ones that take place online. If you’re newly sober or in recovery and trying to avoid places, people, or patterns that may not be healthy for you right now, a gay AA or other recovery meeting might be a double-win for you: support on your path and a boost for your new social life. If you’ve tried AA (or similar meetings) but can’t find a useful groove there, consider an alternative type of program and see if you can find one that helps you manage your substance use in a way that feels healthy and appropriate.

10. Be a fan.

Do you love a particular sports team? Almost every team and stadium now hosts a Pride night and often an LGBTQ fan group. You can meet other people who know as much as you do about RBIs or FGAs or NRRs, but you don’t have to be a superfan—it’s fine to just enjoy all the fit young people running around in Spandex, too, and you can always start a conversation with someone by asking them to explain whatever just happened. Just remember that in basketball, FTM means Free Throws Made (sorry…)

11. Start something.

Maybe you’re wild for birdwatching or motocross or fiber arts or molecular gastronomy and you’d love to practice your skills with other LGBT2Q folks. Why not try starting a group? Post notices in general bird/bike/crochet/sphericizing spaces and let people know that you’re interested in enjoying your hobby in queer company. You may get pushback about this from straight people (“What does your sexuality have to do with whipping your bike?”). Just tell them plainly that you’re looking to make more LGBT2Q friends and you thought it would be nice to find people with whom you also have activities in common (and then don’t feel obligated to listen to their complaints any more).

12. Participate in online communities on Zoom and Discord.

COVID-19 is brutally awful for a million reasons, but one silver lining is that many orgs are increasing their technical knowledge and moving some or all of their programming online—a situation that’s likely to continue even when we find a vaccine, because hosts are able to see how the barrier of physically coming to a space impacts some people more than others. Look up LGBT2Q orgs in your area, or in major cities near to you, and join their meetings, discussions, and watch parties.

13. Speak on it.

Many universities maintain a speakers’ bureau for profs looking to invite a panel of LGBT2Q people to share their stories—you could join one! These panels are a way for young people to see what Janet Mock perfectly named possibility models: people living the lives they want for themselves. They typically offer training to teach you how to frame and tell your story, and speakers’ meetings to process any post-event feelings. These groups do a great service to young people and if you do a few, you’ll get to know some of the other speakers. This is especially great if you feel like the friends you currently have are mostly your same age and have very similar identities to you—panels are often quite diverse in age, gender, and sexual identity, and ideally race and culture as well.

14. (Mis)use hookup apps with gay abandon.

To be clear, a happy, healthy, consenting hookup is a thing of beauty. But if you’re looking for friend connections, you can often find them there as well. There are apps that specifically welcome—and are actually used for!—friends-only connections. I’ve often used them while traveling to find local advice on where to eat or go out, and to find (largely platonic) company to do those things with as a not-especially-cute, somewhat-older queer trans person. By being clear and up front that I’m looking for social company, I’ve met a lot of really lovely folks. Some apps I (and a few trusted friends) recommend for this:

Scruff (generally men but pretty welcoming to queer/trans/nonbinary folks)

Growlr (gay bears and admirers)

Lex (which describes itself as “for lesbian, bisexual, asexual, and queer people. For womxn and trans, genderqueer, intersex, two spirit, and non-binary people for meeting lovers and friends”)

Feeld (a polyamory-focused app with a couple dozen sexual orientations and gender identities available)

15. Pass notes.

It may have a long lead time, but I love a little queer secret agent action. Are there books you love—foundational books, books that shaped and formed your queer identity? Write a note and leave it folded in a library copy (or multiple copies) of those books. Keep it simple: you love this book, you’re looking for friends who also find it meaningful, if that’s you here’s my email (or insta, Tumblr, whatever).

16. Take a page from the kinksters and make trick cards.

Lots of people who are into BDSM have what they call “trick cards”: sort of like a business card, but with a first name or scene name, some contact information, and often a photo or a little bit about what the person likes to get up to. They’re incredibly handy for when you meet someone you want to stay in touch with in a dungeon—or at a protest, march, noisy party, dance floor, reception, or other situation where it’s a little too busy to connect. (Especially great if you’re trying to action #10!) Make cards that say your name, some way to get in touch, and a note like “ask me about my studs and femmes book club!” or “looking for gardening gays!” or even a simple “new in town and trying to make friends!” Just hand it over and invite them to get in touch if they want.

17. Fly the flag (and notice who salutes).

If you go out in an unambiguously queer T-shirt and someone says “Love your shirt!” they’re saying, “Hello, fellow homo!” Say hi back, and maybe stop and chat for a minute? If you have fabulous hair, style, or accessories and someone says “I love your look!” or “What a great color story,” it’s extremely likely they’re saying HELLO I AM ALSO QUEER AND/OR TRANS AND I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.

Note: don’t be fooled if someone doesn’t “look gay.” What even is that? We’re everywhere and we look like anyone and also please don’t contribute to the idea that there’s one way to look gay, cool? Cool.

18. Just say it: tell everyone you want to make more LGBT2Q friends.

There’s a concept in sociology called “weak ties”: people you’re friendly with, maybe mutuals with, but you’re not really friends. And over and over, research has proved that when you’re looking for something new—new job, apartment to rent, and so on—it’s most likely to come through your network of weak ties, because you already know about everything your good friends know about and vice versa.

So, activate your weak ties to help expand your queer social circle. Tell everyone you know even a little bit, regardless of their gender or sexuality, that you’re looking for more LGBT2Q friends. Be specific if you want (“I really want to connect with trans elders”) or just leave it open. They’ll introduce you to their nonbinary cousin, their gay office friend, the trans girl in their PhD cohort, or whomever. Awkward coffee dates? Probably! Cool people you might never have otherwise encountered who are at least somewhat vouched by someone you know? Definitely.",,
'Skin Hunger' Is Real and It Can Affect You Mentally,"For a person like me who’s not really fond of technology and the new trends people are obsessed with these days to feel connected with their friends, I constantly keep thinking about how things are going to be once this is over.

Apart from the many things I look forward to—travel, going back to college, going out to eat—a simple thing I once took for granted and now am waiting for is just hugging the people I love. High-fiving my little cousin, putting my arm around my friend, mock-punching the sibling.

For a lot of us, our skin is the means through which we intuit the energies of others, in a way FaceTiming or calls could never do. We also want to comfort and be comforted through our skin and when this hasn't happened in months, one of our most used senses begins to starve.

“Skin hunger” or touch deprivation occurs when a person experiences little to no touch from other living things. Often, this isn’t considered a real problem but studies have found that they can have some serious and long-lasting effects. Touch is pretty much a fundamental mode of human communication. Be it a mother cradling her baby, lovers intertwining their fingers, or best friends hugging each other—a lot of how we connect with other human beings is born out of touch. This is also why prisoners in solitary confinement have been reported of as craving human touch almost as much as liberty.

“Touch deprivation can have negative impacts—it could lead to a drop in less dopamine, and we would feel less connected to people,” says Aanchal Narang, a counselling psychologist and founder of Another Light Counselling. “Warmth makes us feel connected to people. Any amount of daily activity cannot make up for it, whether it is something as simple as someone shaking your hand or you going to get a haircut—it all matters. Now that we’re working from home and cannot meet friends, skin hunger is getting real.”

With the pandemic making even regular grocery store visits stressful, the isolation has left many of us craving for that human touch. And for those living alone, this unfulfilled desire to find comfort in someone else’s touch could be especially tough.

“If I think of the months before March, every time I felt alone or lonely, my friends were around me,” says 23-year-old Navya, who is currently studying MBA in Connecticut and has been staying alone since the last seven months. “They’d give me a tight hug or a pat on the back that somehow helped me to feel at least a little better for the time being. But now it’s a distant dream. Because the flights got cancelled and I couldn’t go back home when the pandemic struck, I thought I’d just stay here and focus on my studies. But now, there are days when I just feel like running away from all of this because it’s just impossible for me to concentrate and stay alone all the time.”

According to scientists, we have a nerve ending called C-tactile afferents that “responds optimally to slowly moving, gentle touch, typical of a caress.” This touch also increases release of oxytocin—also called the “cuddle hormone”—which promotes feelings of devotion, trust and bonding, laying the biological foundation for connecting with others. And while sexual touch plays its own role in providing pleasure, the touch we’re talking about here is simply platonic. The absence of it, on the other hand, increases stress, depression and anxiety, triggering a cascade of negative physiological effects.

“In a country like India, we are quite tactile in our platonic friendships and have been deprived of them for so long,” says Rhea Gandhi, a psychotherapist and chairperson of the Indian Chapter of the International Attachment Network, to VICE. “When stressed, our body releases a hormone called cortisol and one of the ways to calm people is through touch. Like when a baby is crying in a pram, they often quiet down when picked up and held close, making them feel safe. Skin to skin contact in childhood is the most comforting. This is the beginning for when touch begins to become soothing. In fact, research has shown that if we aren't touched enough as babies, we might experience an array of developmental difficulties.”

Failing to experience frequent positive touch as a child may affect the development of the oxytocin which might result in damaging intimacy and social skills, although this isn’t true for everyone. According to a study published in Comprehensive Psychology, people whose parents were regular huggers were more likely to hug people in adulthood.

A lot of people link touch with trust and if they don’t trust a certain person, they’re unlikely to want that person to touch them. But that doesn’t mean they don’t like being touched. Not liking being touched can have various reasons. Not being really fond of touch is sometimes reported by people who identify themselves as asexual or by the those on the neurodiverse spectrum.

“I was alone in Bengaluru for six months and my office work just became work from home,” says 25-year-old Arjun. “It wasn’t just difficult; it was too much to even take. I’d often call my friends or my mom and would constantly keep talking to them while working because that gave me a sense of relief and like someone was there with me. But this wasn’t really helpful for long. I came home to Delhi in August and it has been much better after that. Living with my family at least is helping. I can talk to my mom, go for a walk with her, hug her and it’s been much better after that.”

Touch can often calm other bodily functions such as blood pressure and our heart rate. It can also help tackle loneliness. Studies have shown that a gentle, positive touch from a stranger can also help in reducing the feelings of social exclusion.

“Often, sexual touch might not offer the same kind of comfort,” says Gandhi. “The [platonic touch] sensation is different from erotic touch. Touch, in India especially, is also linked closely with trust, especially for women. We often feel comforted when we are touched by those we consider safe, and that offers us a sense of security and connection.”

While technology has come to our rescue tremendously amid the pandemic, one thing it still can’t do is replicate or substitute the skin-on-skin contact. Even haptic technology that is used in stuff like sex toys and video games to mimic sensation, cannot reproduce the feel of a human touch.

However, there are strategies you can use to reduce skin hunger. One of them is with animals. “Being able to touch and be comforted by another living being is really helpful to quench this thirst in a touch desert. Another tip I have is to perhaps try and self-soothe using an action you felt at peace with, when a parent/caregiver did it. For example,. if your parents pat your head in a certain rhythm to make you fall asleep as a child, maybe try and do that for yourself,” Gandhi added.

Even hugging a pillow can be helpful and can bring on warmth both from the pressure against your skin, which mimics touch from another person or pet, which your brain still interprets as an embrace. Massages, long showers, dancing, even just walking around your room are few activities that can help overcome touch hunger when you’re alone. Till the time we get to a place where the very things we loved aren’t also the things that boost the spread of the virus—hugs, handshakes, high-fives—hang in there. And maybe adopt an animal.",,
I Valiantly Tried To Make One New Friend During a Pandemic,"According to this year’s ONS report on coronavirus and loneliness, around 50 per cent of people over the age of 16 had felt some level of loneliness within the week the survey was taken. It’s a pretty bleak statistic. Being lonely can increase mortality rates by 26 percent, lonely young people are more likely to get wasted more often, and loneliness – obviously – has a detrimental effect on mental health.

I can definitely relate: While I don’t live alone, I’ve been feeling lonelier than usual during the pandemic. The numbing of this issue with an extra beer, endless podcasts and scrolling through brain-melting Twitter spats has been okay, but it isn’t quite working anymore. I also realised that it’s October already and I don’t think I’ve made m(any) new mates this year.

Making new mates was hard as an adult guy in the Before Times (in 2019 it was reported that one in five men have no one they’d call a “close friend”), but without parties and gigs and festivals, it’s even harder. Where is it supposed to happen? Two metres away from someone at the supermarket? Sober outside a pub at the 10PM curfew? With that in mind, I decided to set myself a challenge: to make one new mate in a pandemic. To do this, I devised five friend-making methods. There were some ups and downs. My findings are as follows.

I SENT OUT A TWEET

Tweeting felt quite natural at first, as that’s all I ever seem to do these days. Yet as soon as I hit send, I felt something akin to the hungover regret of seeing the stories you’ve replied to for absolutely no reason. After 43 seconds of no notifications, I was convinced that everyone hated me. Then suddenly I received a DM from someone asking about going for a pint.

They also seemed like someone I would actually go for a pint with, which I suppose I hadn’t even thought about until then. After agreeing to a time and place, I quickly deleted the tweet before my fame spiralled and I had to recruit a personal assistant. This all took about one minute to unfold.

Conclusion: 8/ 10. Despite the general bad vibes of Twitter, most people want to make new friends too, so if you swallow your ego this should work (provided neither person flakes later on).

I SIGNED UP TO A DATING APP (FOR A FRIEND)

Photo: Rhys Thomas

So I made a Bumble BFF profile, which is an app for mates. Initially I thought about just using an actual dating app, but quickly figured it would have caused headaches later on (“Are we just friends?” “Yes we are sorry, I meant that very literally”). Plus an actual friend-seeking app exists, so why not just have some relative certainty in this godforsaken 2020? I also didn’t mind having to take selfies knowing that I wouldn’t be dismissed for being ugly, as that isn’t the point here: Everyone wants to be the hot friend.

Throughout the week I was a little picky about who I want to have a chat with and swiped right on about 25 people. There’s one person whom I do actually hope to match with, as he seems like a sound guy, but we haven’t yet. I also set the location distance to seven miles, because I am not trekking to Margate for anyone.

I ended up matching with two people, which would be upsetting except I’ve realised that realistically there’s not a huge chance of me making friends this way – there’s just no vibing. I’ve had brief (up to three) nice messages with the aforementioned two people, but I can’t see us buying matching bracelets anytime soon.

Conclusion: 2/10. This should have worked the best in theory, but mainly I didn’t have much in common with anyone on Bumble BFF other than the fact we were on a friend app.

ACTUALLY SUGGESTING A TIME AND PLACE TO THAT PERSON YOU’VE BEEN SAYING ‘WE MUST MEET UP PROPERLY SOME TIME’ TO FOR YEARS

This should have been the easiest one to do, except I had an unshakeable fear that they would read and ignore the message, undoing years of brief, light responses to a cool outfit or dog on the story, ending each time with “we really must meet up sometime!”

In reality it worked out just fine. I just messaged exactly what we should have messaged at some point many times before, asking if they wanted to meet up and when they’re free. They did respond (can you believe?) and we agreed to meet at a specific time and place as soon as it’s figured out what’s actually legal this week when it comes to socialising.

Conclusion: 9/10. If you want to be mates with that distant online acquaintance, actually suggest a time and place, then follow through, then follow through again. There’s no secret formula! It really is that simple.

A FRIEND OF A FRIEND

This was surprisingly daunting, so I put it off until the penultimate day of the experiment. Can you imagine asking your mate for a mate and they genuinely can’t think of anyone who’d like you? Or worse, they don’t reply and the chat has to be deleted and new accounts have to be made just to shake away the horrible stench of passive rejection?

Anyway, this actually went quite well. I consulted my “V for Virgo” group chat because I figured the addition of mutual star signs made for greater security. Pretty much immediately I was given the suggestion of someone who sounds like he could well be my twin. I’m not sure if I want to have a twin, but I’m sure there’d be enough to talk about over an afternoon when we meet up. We also have mutual friends we can meet up with, which should make things less weird.

Conclusion: 7/10. Unless you and your mates have wildly different ideas about the sort of person you’d hang with, this is almost fail safe.

A WALKING ADVERTISEMENT

Strange resort, yes, but this felt like the best way to re-create organically meeting someone new without having to sit near anyone or start yelling a conversation starter. The plan was simple: make a sign explaining the situation, stand somewhere busy, have a brief chat with someone and exchange social media handles or else throw the sign in the bin immediately and frolic around Shoreditch two metres away from my shiny new pal.

I decided to research which colours were most friendly (yellow) and wore the closest thing I could find to yellow. After that I made the sign, which was a little bit @babakganjei but whatever. Towards the end I decided to add a nice smiley face to it, which is the moment things went very wrong. I couldn’t get the smile to be a nice curve, so I kept going over it and it got thicker. It looked evil. The smiley face looked very threatening. I gave it thick eyebrows to compensate, but I don’t think they worked.

I started on Brick Lane and later around Spitalfields Market in east London. Very quickly a pigeon got way too close to me. I tried to stay because maybe it wanted to be my friend, but I don’t like pigeons so I shooed it away. Beyond my grapples with wild flying beasts, I did have a few people read my sign and smile or giggle, but literally nobody approached me. I also received a stern look from a police officer. I then realised my message perhaps could have been misread as suggesting having COVID is lonely and that I (with COVID) wanted a friend. I had been out for over an hour by this point, so I went home.

Conclusion: 1/10. Holding a sign did not help me make new friends during a pandemic. Passersby actually appeared a bit frightened. Perhaps my marketing could have been better.",,
An Actually Useful Guide to Not Being On Your Phone All the Time,"How to Stay In is a series about redefining ""normal"" life in order to take care of ourselves and one another during the COVID-19 pandemic. See More →

Right now, the internet is the primary form of communication for a lot of people. Many of us need to be online far more than we'd otherwise be in order to socialize, stay informed, and work (or to look for work—in which case, please consult this guide to job-hunting online with minimal pain).

This means that anyone who was feeling Too Online before this pandemic started may be currently reaching their personal “I need to shoot my phone” threshold. But knowing you’d probably feel better if you, say, ate a real meal and moved your body for a few minutes instead of logging on for the dozenth time today isn’t the same as actually doing it.

If you’re struggling to detach yourself from your various devices during this pandemic—or, if you can't do that out of necessity, but would like strategies for constantly looking at a screen without wanting to crack it into pieces—here are some tips that might help you.

Get specific about the reasons you’re on your phone or computer so you can find less soul-sucking ways to use them to your benefit.

It's pretty inarguable that our phones (and, specifically, social media apps) often drain us of valuable time and energy. I’ve certainly been guilty of planning to do something that would make me feel good, and then… not doing that because I simply couldn’t stop scrolling.

Scrolling often starts with good intentions—you’re responding to a text, reading an article, or trying to see pics of a friend’s new baby, and then you hop over to clear a notification or open Twitter out of habit. Suddenly, four hours have passed, and you feel vaguely nauseated and ready to fight the next person you encounter who has any sort of opinion about “cancel culture.”

To help avoid this, put some thought into specifically how and why you’re using your phone, so you can then decide if there are less exhausting ways to reap the benefits you're actually after. Go through the apps you use the most (iMessage, Instagram, News, YouTube, etc.) and think about the core reason you want to check each app, the problems the app is causing within that goal, and some alternatives you could try in order to stick more closely to your initial plan.

For example: You might intend to use Instagram to see what your friends have been up to. The problem might be that the updates from your friends are getting lost in all the noise and inane influencer Stories—and/or the fact that social media isn’t a full picture of anyone’s actual life or feelings. The alternatives might be talking with those same friends one-on-one more regularly, unfollowing or muting half the people you currently follow (or more, if you still feel overwhelmed), or limiting yourself to 20 minutes a day—during which you make a point to look at the profiles of the friends you actually care about instead of whatever the algorithm puts in front of you.

Consider posting less on your own accounts.

It’s worthwhile to think about not just what you’re consuming, but also what you’re putting out into the world. Posting stories, tweeting, and messaging can lead to a cycle where people respond to you, so then you respond—or just open the app to read their responses—and then you’re unwittingly glued to your feeds again.

There’s no exact amount of posting that is Good and Right for everyone, but there is likely an amount (or type of post) that generally brings you happiness and connection, and an amount that is just-because filler. If you find yourself posting a lot, check in with yourself to ask what, exactly, you’re seeking, and whether there are other ways to do that that would leave you feeling better. Will the thought you’re about to hit send on (or any of the possible replies) actually make you feel better in an hour, or tomorrow? How might it do that? If you're not finding convincing answers, pick a way to be good to yourself that doesn't involve refreshing, and refreshing, and refreshing.

Treat your phone less like a pocket computer and more like an actual telephone.

As much as I love a good text conversation, I can admit that messaging means I’m online more than I might otherwise be, and that I’m often on other apps while I’m texting with friends. One solution: Bring back the humble phone call, a tried-and-true way for staying in touch with people across a distance (and less of a Whole Thing than Zoom conversations).

If you haven’t talked to anyone on the phone in a while and shudder at the thought, I can tell you: I was once in the same boat, but was pleased to discover that it’s uplifting, fun, and comes back much like riding a bicycle famously does. If you need further convincing, Madeleine Aggeler made a good case for phone calls in The Cut last year. (One caveat: If you go this route, consider giving your friends a heads-up that you’re going to start calling more often, so they don’t see you calling them and assume someone died.)

Find creative ways to keep in touch with people that don’t rely on social media.

Updating your nearest and dearest individually can be exhausting, but apps aren’t necessarily the best way to communicate personal or semi-private info to a big group of people that often includes professional connections, acquaintances, and a few strangers. It’s also not a terribly effective way to learn about what’s going on with friends.

A weekly family FaceTime or a Sunday email to the people you care about most might be a better way of staying in touch, while also being far less draining to make happen than a bunch of IG stories where you’re only being 50 percent honest.

Turn off notifications and/or rearrange your home screen to hide certain apps.

I quickly discovered that I was mainly opening these apps more out of muscle memory and not a desire to see what was happening. I also learned that I don’t really miss them—the extent to which “out of sight, out of mind” was true was, frankly, embarrassing.

Consider not allowing any notifications beyond phone calls and, maybe, text sounds strictly for the most important people in your life. If you need to get work email notifications, use a different mail app for your personal email so you aren’t subjected to persistent alerts from whatever company really wants you to know that you left something in your cart a week ago. Mute everything you can, and move on with your life.

Figure out a way to catch up on the news that doesn’t lead to hours of doomscrolling.

It’s reasonable—and responsible—to want to be informed on the state of the world, especially now, when it’s effectively on fire. But catching up via Twitter is exhausting and, often, it produces the opposite effect you're hoping for in terms of processing what's important/factual/relevant, news-wise.

If you know, in your heart, that getting your news on social media is taking years off your life, consider limiting your news consumption to once or twice a day, and doing it in a more concentrated way (like listening to a briefing podcast as you get ready for work, signing up for an EOD newsletter with the most important stories, or going directly to the New York Times or Washington Post homepage in the morning and evening). You may be pleasantly surprised by how possible it is to be informed without subjecting yourself to minute-by-minute updates on the latest bad tweet.

Get a hobby and an “I’m bored and I need to shut my brain off for a little while” activity.

It’s hard to be on your phone less when you don’t have anything better to do. If you keep picking up your phone out of habit or boredom, find some alternative ways to spend your time.

If you don’t have a hobby, now is a great time to get one, and it doesn’t have to be complicated or time-consuming (no offense to sourdough). Some recommendations: reading books, getting into a new-to-you docuseries, or making art or gifts for friends.

Not all downtime has to be productive. You should also feel OK about zoning out for a bit every day. If doing that via your phone is leaving you feeling gross, consider some other options that are just as mindlessly entertaining, but are a little more structured—think watching reality TV or old sitcoms. And video games! I’ve started picking up my Nintendo Switch and playing Animal Crossing when I’m on the brink of losing an hour of my life to my phone, and I feel much better as a result.

Let go of the idea that you have to be constantly on, available, and up to speed on every micro-drama, meme, and niche news story.

This is, I think, one of the most difficult parts of putting the above tips into practice. All of these pings and beeps and bloops are exhausting, sure, but they can also feel kind of good—they make us feel needed, seen, important, and less alone. It’s especially hard to disconnect, even just by stepping away for an hour, if you enjoy being a responsive friend and/or aware of what’s going on in the world. Being on your phone less can leave you feeling worried about letting folks down for not responding to their DMs quickly enough, out of the loop, or otherwise just… guilty.

But wanting a little space during a pandemic doesn’t make you a bad person, and being constantly available isn’t a requirement of being a good friend. (And you may discover that the people who give you a hard time about it are actually not so interested in talking to you, specifically, but simply enjoy having a friend-shaped receptacle where they can dump every thought that pops into their head.)",,
Lockdown Loneliness Inspired Me to Create a Load of Imaginary Friends,"A few weeks into lockdown, VICE UK put a call out to some of our favourite photographers. We wanted submissions for photo essays that reflect the time we're living in – but interesting, imaginative projects, not just ""I'm stuck inside, here are some pictures of my cheese-plant"".

Luckily, because the photographers we reached out to are all interesting and imaginative people, we got a ton of great ideas back, which we've whittled down to ten final projects. We're running one every week for ten weeks, to be followed by an exhibition you can stage in your very own home (details on that to come).

The fourth project is by Flora Maclean, who has kindly explained it for you below.

I started this project right at the beginning of lockdown, when we all felt super lonely and weird. I wanted to make light of the situation and make myself feel better at the same time, subverting the idea that loneliness or being alone is this heavy, deep thing that we were all experiencing.

I was living alone at the time, so I decided to make little imaginary friends to keep me company. Kinda like when Tom Hanks makes Wilson in 'Cast Away'. Limited by what I already had in the house, I improvised and shot them all in my living room, one a day over the course of a week. It was a good exercise for my brain. I wanted to keep busy and reflect on this time we were in, without thinking about it too deeply.

It's in retrospect that the project takes on a deeper meaning. Making friends out of found objects in this confined space, but staying connected to people via technology – Zoom, Facetime, etc – shows that friends don't need to have a physical presence to be a significant presence.",,
I Escaped Reality By Playing the Sims 4,"This article originally appeared on VICE France.

I was lazily scrolling through my first weekend of quarantine when an ad on Facebook caught my eye. ""Create your own world with The Sims 4 – 75 percent off for a limited time only!"" I'd forgotten about the addictive virtual reality game I'd loved playing as a kid, when I'd spend hours building ugly houses and trying to learn how to speak Simlish. Hit by a pang of nostalgia, I downloaded it. It felt like buying a pack of cigarettes 20 years after quitting smoking.

When I was a kid, The Sims let me imagine myself as a grown-up. I could have everything: the perfect career, a house with a garden, a loyal husband, kids, a dog, a cat. Now, stuck at home, I wanted to recreate my real life and actually live it. I spent a good hour making a Sim that looked and dressed like me. I then filled out a personality test that generated my alter ego's character traits and aspirations based on my answers. I didn't know how to react when I saw the result – Chloé Sim wasn't a journalist, but a ""not-quite-in-demand comedian"". And she was a snob, or a Sim with ""no time for low-quality things [who is] bored by 'low brow' television, and gains confidence around other Snob Sims"". I could relate.

Next, I bought a modest house in Willow Creek for 15,000 Simoleons, a very exciting purchase for a Parisian renter. Then I bought a computer and a microphone to work on my comedy. An hour or two went by and Chloé Sim was alone, talking into a microphone in her living room with a full bladder and an empty stomach. The scene was incredibly sad. She started shaking and begging her creator (me) to end the stand-up session and let her go pee.

Chloé Sims is a mediocre comedian.

At that point I realised I'd been playing for five hours. Five hours without going to the bathroom, eating or drinking – but also without thinking about the coronavirus or the anxiety of being stuck indoors indefinitely. Unable to resist sharing my virtual adventures, I posted about them on Instagram. The validating reactions from friends who remember the game fondly kept me from feeling too bad about spending the whole day on it.

The next day I started to lose patience: Chloé Sim wasn't making enough money with her shitty comedy sets to satisfy her snobby needs. Luckily, my muscle memory kicked into gear: I hit ctrl+shift+c, and discovered that the old cheat codes still work. Keep pressing them and Simoleons will magically appear in your bank account, no virtual work required. I was rich – by which I mean, my Sim was. I'd promised myself I wouldn’t play for more than an hour, but suddenly I was three-deep into a full home makeover. I chose light wooden flooring with exposed red bricks walls and decorated the rooms with cacti and candles. I also gave Chloé Sim the best refrigerator and the comfiest bed Simoleons could buy. Maybe now she would start moving up in the world.

A few hours later, my efforts paid off. Chloé Sim went to a few parties and made new friends. Meanwhile, in real life, I'd spent many uninspired hours on Tinder, putting up with the lamest coronavirus ice-breakers imaginable – ""Hope you stocked up on macaroni!"" or ""You might be my last match before the end of the world!"" I decided dating by proxy was much more appealing, so jumped back into Chloé Sims' world and introduced myself to the first Sim passing by.

Florent wasn't at all my type – his moustache made me uneasy and he was wearing a horrible vest with rainbow stripes. But the longer I talked to this idiot, the more my confidence and charisma traits would increase in the game. I tested some jokes on him and then went on the offensive, asking him if he was single. I also told him I wanted to dance and make a chocolate cake together – all while in my underwear. Unfortunately, Florent wandered off.

Disappointed, I vented about Florent to my actual best friend Alban that evening. Oh god, I was talking about my Sim's life as if it were my own. ""Well,"" Alban said, ""I think the game is actually good for you. It’s definitely keeping your mind occupied."" He was right. I stopped feeling guilty and really leaned into it.",,
"""What Are Ugly People Meant To Do?""","My friend reassured me that the tide would turn, and eventually it did. And I could give you the same reassurances, but those ring hollow now that you're hitting 40. You have a larger sample size for your despair than I had back when I was a 20-year-old virgin. You've tried everything and you've hit a wall. Also, guys are massive dicks. And now you're stuck inside for at least another month, if not longer. Fucking awful.

It sucks. I know. I spent the entirety of my adolescence worried that no one would ever kiss me, let alone love me. I fell madly in love with a couple of girls, but all of those first loves went unrequited. One afternoon in college, I went to my room and started crying on the bed. Loudly. My friend walked in and asked me if I was okay. I must have looked like someone in my family had just died. And I told him, outright, that girls didn't like me. Everything I had tried to get them to notice me—playing sports, befriending them, using Dep to style my hair, sending them mixtapes—had barely registered. I was invisible to love. I would never have a girlfriend. I would never get laid. When you're that lonely, it feels like a permanent condition. You go outside and it feels like everyone else has someone except for you. Even ugly-ass motherfuckers are walking around with a boyfriend or girlfriend and you're like, ""Well why do THEY get to be loved and not me?""

I ""got out there""—volunteering, joining my union, going on speed dating nights even, and hitting the tickboxes generously. Either I got no matches or got ghosted. I don't have any expectations of True Wuv or pulling Chris Evans, I'd settle for a fumble with any dude above the age of consent who regularly brushes his teeth and isn't a Nazi. But despite maintaining decent hygiene levels myself and being OK company (I managed to make friends at all my ""getting out there"" endeavors, just not any more than friends), I'm resorting to offering to be the demo body at First Aid training just to get some human contact. I'm nudging 40 and in good health but am looking at literal decades ahead of me full of cold showers and body pillows. What the fuck are we meant to do?

What are ugly people meant to do? Like, I am generally OK with the (sorry) state of my looks—Melissa McCarthy's body with way smaller boobs, Joe Pesci's face with Steve Buscemi's eyes—because it's not like I have to see it. But Christ is it miserable to be stuck in the dating discount bin like Stinky Pete the Prospector.

Secondly, you need a plan beyond just putting yourself out there:A new plan'll give you a bit more hope than if you keep trying the same shit. First of all, you're probably gonna want to talk to a therapist, which can be done online but ain't cheap. Secondly, the thing I learned during my fallow years was that the harder I tried to find love, the more elusive it became. Girls only really noticed me during the five minutes per day when I was too locked into doing something else that I wasn't even THINKING about getting laid. So you can't be a person whose chief attribute is ""looking for love."" There's reason every online dating profile starts off with a guy or girl saying that they're super into rock climbing. They want to show that they're interesting and not just attractive. You could do that. Take up playing the bass. I promise you that there's no way you're uglier than the average bassist. And bassists get laid a LOT! It's baffling.

BUT … well now, I'm not just gonna give you more reasons to feel like shit. Eventually THAT starts to ring hollow, too. So first off, I just wanna tell you that you're not alone in feeling alone. Especially right now! Literally no one can touch anyone in America. So there are many people suffering from social isolation today in ways that go past merely being bored (me) but perhaps don't rise to the level of severe depression (millions more). But even once the pandemic goes away—not that the federal government seems all that interested in making it go away—there'll still be other people out there like you, wondering when they'll finally find someone. You can commiserate with these people, maybe even marry one of them.

I gotta be delicate here Winona, because you're a woman and I'm a man and this is the internet, where every Redditor tells every woman, ""Hey lady you gotta drop 30 pounds if you wanna be more than a 4!"" This isn't about hitting a goal weight or doing the romcom thing where you switch to contact lenses and suddenly you're not a nerd anymore. This is about rebuilding yourself in a way that goes beyond some beauty mag giving you 18 Foolproof Tips To Make Him Explode. Seek out new physical and mental activities. Take an objective look in your closet and see if what you're wearing makes you feel good. (I am currently wearing track pants that are too long and a shirt I've already pitted out, so I have work to do myself here.) Find new sources of stimulation. (Oh God, now I REALLY sound like a dad. Every day it's just my wife and I going, ""The kids really needed the stimulation they got from that walk to the bank!"")

Lastly, you said you're ""generally OK"" with your looks but only because you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror if you don't want to. You called yourself ugly in the standard joking-but-not-really-joking way. So you're clearly not okay with your looks. You're avoiding yourself and it's coloring your whole mood. Movies and TV taught me that inner and outer beauty were distinct and separate entities, but that's not true at all. Turns out Shallow Hal was TOTAL horseshit. Who knew? When you love yourself and feel good about who you are as a person, people SEE it and gravitate to you. Going the other way, take it from Deion Sanders: ""If you look good, you feel good. If you feel good, you play good. If you play good, they pay good."" Inner and outer beauty are inextricably linked, and clearly one is affecting the other for you right now, and not in a good way.

But there's no avoiding the temptation, because kids get bored and a shitty volleyball net promises them outdoor STIMULATION with no screen time. I will never stop falling for this pitch because I remain ever desperate to get my kids the fuck off of screens. I hate to tack on an ""especially now"" to every goddamn answer this week, but alas. I have spent the past two weeks feverishly brainstorming outdoor activities that we can do in the backyard that don't require the presence of other, potentially diseased children to keep my own children occupied. Nothing was dismissed out of hand. I even said to my wife, ""Hey girl, maybe I dig up the yard myself and make a very tiny basketball court for them."" We ruled that out for 500 different reasons, but holy shit what if we're stuck here ALL summer with nowhere else to fucking go?! Tom, I'll buy the volleyball net off you. Even if the kids only play with it for 10 minutes, that's 10 fewer minutes I'll need to keep these savages entertained while the world burns.

That's the kind of shit that has kept Dick's in business for over 70 years. I remember I bought a cornhole set there once. I used to get so fucking jacked anytime I saw cornhole out at a cookout or at an outdoor bar, and now I'd have a set all for ME! We used that set four times before it broke. Dick owes my ass $70.

As I drive around in the summer I see so many houses with volleyball nets. They range from cheap volleyball/badminton dual purpose set to serious 4""x4"" pressure treated posts. Does anyone use a volleyball net more than once? Why do we keep fooling ourselves into thinking it's worth the effort? My kids guilted me into the Sportscraft set one summer and it now sits an unused tangled mess in the garage—just like the one my father bought for me.

The point is, you'll keep feeling helpless if you don't find new shit that reshapes you spiritually if not physically. Then you'll feel good about yourself. That'll remain true even if you keep getting negged on Tinder, because you won't have invested all of your hopes and dreams into someone noticing you. Then you'll feel more confident, and then suddenly there's Timothee Chamalet at your doorstep. Nude. BOOYAKASHA. Love only comes when you don't force it, which is what makes it so, so annoying. We really need this virus to fuck off so all the bars can reopen.

For the shoe issue, I simply disrupt the shoe economy by inventing an aqua sock that could accommodate morning toe wood. Or I could wear Yeezys. One time I was at the GQ office and they had a pair of Yeezys sitting around, as you might expect at the GQ office. So I put them on and they were basically socks with soles. You could get a toe boner in these sneakers. Might be a little bit of a squeeze but it's doable. Or I could get the weirdos who make those Vibram FiveFingers toe shoes to make a custom FiveBoners variety just for me. And they would! Sneaker companies love making custom shit for famous people. And with my erotic deformity, I would qualify. I would be the Toe Dick Guy. Pornographers would pay me MILLIONS.

Penis toes. I don't want people to see my hand dicks all day long. I don't want to see them either. If I'm still functional with 10 penis toes, then gimme those. Pissing out of them would be an issue, but I'm gonna cheat and pretend that the Mother Penis between my legs can handle ALL urinary and ejaculatory duties on their behalf. Imagine if it couldn't! Imagine if you had to do all that out of your extremities!

Would you rather have penis fingers or penis toes? Normal penis rules apply, they get hard when you're aroused, shrink in cold water, etc. Assume that they are functional and you can still walk/pick stuff up without problems. It would be embarrassing having penis fingers while out in public but penis toes would make it hard to wear shoes if you happen to get boner toes.

So as far as I'm concerned, free shoes are fair game. Wipe 'em down and spray the insoles with Lysol like a good little boy. After that, they're yours to cherish. There's gonna be a lot of high-end junk left out on the streets as we go deeper into quarantine and families go the full Marie Kondo to stave off cabin fever. So you may as well enjoy the chance to engage in socially distant, legally approved looting while you have the chance. We scored an old bike just this weekend. I scoured it free of germs and lubed the chain and adjusted the seat height for my boy, then he bitched when I asked him to ride it. Little bastard. I should have gotten him a volleyball set.

I live in the suburbs, which means there's free shit sitting out in front of houses every weekend: furniture, lamps, Little Tikes toys, grill parts, etc. The amount of waste wouldn't shock you, but it would still anger you. I have driven past an appealing curbside good, texted my wife that I saw a free birdcage sitting out, and then doubled back to go retrieve it after her formal approval. One time I saw a bunch of cool shit in front of a house and was on the verge of grabbing it when I realized that the items were outside because someone was moving in. I almost stole a goddamn dining chair set from a family just trying to unpack. Not my best moment.

A friend of mine was recently walking down the street and came across a pair of brown wing-tip boots out in front of an apartment. They were set out like an old sofa—potentially up for grabs, but maybe just waiting for the garbage truck to pick it up. He thought about it for a bit after passing by, and then walked back to pick them up and took them home. He says they were in good shape and only needed to change out the insoles. What do you think about picking up shoes off the street? Good deal or this-is-how-we-get-bed-bugs bad idea?

Patrick:

My wife is due with our first child in two months. We are excited, but one of the things we've noticed (and are getting tired of) is that everyone we talk to either has some random bits of advice or some form of the classic, ""Ohh, your life's about to change"" line. Is there a way to avoid the unsolicited advice from people, or is this just an inevitability having a child that we need to deal with? And, as a follow-up, does this get any better the more kids you have?

There's no way to avoid it with your first child. You'll be a touch more sheltered from it during quarantine, but you'll still get emails and DMs and Insta comments from Childrearing Knowers who desperately need to tell you how sleep-deprived you're about to be. You cannot stop them…

UNTIL you have a second child. Once you have a second kid, no one gives a fuck anymore. They know that you know all the basic miseries of the job, so they can't delude themselves into thinking they're the first people to spring the news on you. They'll move onto some other new parent to torture with their friendly warnings. May as well get back to conceiving while you've got the free time.

Philip:

As a lifelong standing wiper, I have something that I'm genuinely curious about given the somewhat recent discovery that some people sit to wipe. How do sitters admire their work? Do they stand up to take a look upon completion, like we standers? Do they grab their dick and balls to move them out of the way and look between their legs? Lift a cheek and check on the side?

I look between my legs. There's enough room to get a good look before I wipe. My dick isn't a totem pole. I do not lift a cheek and view from the side. My spine is not built to accommodate such contortions. And I can't stand and look because I gotta wipe first. Once the toilet paper goes into the bowl, the view is ruined. Toilet paper wads are the cloud cover of a good bowel movement. Very hard for that brown sunlight to shine through. I do not enjoy the idea of standing up with my ass unwiped. My asscheeks have to maintain their own social distancing pre-wipe.

Bryce:

I just moved to Chicago after growing up and going to college in the South, and as I'm falling very much in love with the Midwest it seems like everyone I know can't understand why anyone would live above the Mason-Dixon. Everyone up here complains about the cold but have you spent more than a few days in the South?? Have you BEEN to Disney when its 100 degrees and 100% humidity?? The only reason places like New Orleans and Nashville are bearable is because you're actively encouraged to be blackout drunk the whole time you're there. Either way, cold or hot, you're indoors for most of the month! Also it seems like people are much nicer up here, people can be passive aggressive in the South. People complain about how expensive it is, but I would gladly pay a little extra to live up here. You're a hearty Midwesterner right, back me up here, the south is overrated isn't it?

I grew up in Minnesota so I can't sit here and accuse OTHER Americans of being overly passive-aggressive. I know Southerners have their own particular brand of false niceties. ""Bless your heart,"" etc. But at least they hand you a jar of delicious banana pudding instead of a Jell-O casserole when they do it. Chicago is the best Midwestern city because it harbors fewer passive-aggressive dickheads than the surrounding heartland, but it more than makes up for that by being the most corrupt and segregated city in the fucking universe.",,
How to Deal With Loneliness During Coronavirus Self-Quarantine,"It can be even more difficult if you’re doing it alone, especially if you wish you weren't. Like, Oh, you don’t like working from home alongside your significant other? Cool—I’m worried about not touching another human for the next three months and dying alone, but go off, I guess!!!

Social distancing and sheltering in place during a pandemic is a big emotional undertaking, even if you live with someone you absolutely adore.

How to Stay In is a series about redefining ""normal"" life in order to take care of ourselves and one another during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Solitude is what Lead Yourself First authors Raymond Kethledge and Michael Erwin define as “a subjective state of mind in which the mind, isolated from input from other minds, works through a problem on its own.” Solitude is about being truly alone with your thoughts—so, not being on your phone or in conversation with other people, not texting or tweeting constantly, not even watching TV or reading a book.

Loneliness is a feeling that can set in regardless of how alone you are. It often feels like not really being known: not having anyone to talk to in your city, at your new job, from your couch in quarantine, and/or not having a deep-shallow person who you can be totally yourself with and talk to about every little mundane detail of your day. Humans ultimately need some social connection to feel good and right—even humans who are comfortable with a lot of alone time—so it’s important to be proactive in addressing any loneliness you’re feeling right now.

Being alone, generally speaking, means being physically by yourself. (If you live with a roommate who you’re not really friends with, or you are dating someone but they aren’t nearby, you may feel like you are functionally alone right now, and might also find this article helpful.)

There’s definitely overlap between these three concepts, but they have different solutions, and it’s helpful to know what you’re working with.

Being comfortable being alone is really hard—especially in these circumstances—but it’s also a skill you can cultivate (even in these circumstances). If you’re social distancing alone right now and hating it, here are some ways to navigate the biggest challenges, and some tips to keep in mind over the coming weeks.

The way to deal with these dark thoughts is not to try to tune them out entirely, or to attempt to quiet them through outside approval. Instead, work on figuring out who you are, and on believing, on a deep level, that you are good and whole and worthy. Getting to that point and learning to enjoy your own company probably won’t happen overnight, but you can take small steps.

So often, discomfort with solitude is rooted in not really liking yourself all that much, and in the fear that your aloneness says something about your worth. But not having a partner (or a strong social network, or a reliable family) doesn’t mean you’re broken, fucked up, or unloveable. Now—more than ever—is the time to keep reminding yourself of that.

It’s also worth considering how creating content—status updates, IG stories, tweets, texts—can stand in the way of feeling OK with solitude. The more you post, the more responses you’re going to get… which is going to lead to spending more time on apps overall. You’re not really alone with your thoughts, observations, and experiences—aka, experiencing solitude—when you’re posting, so pausing your output for an hour or a half-day can be another effective way to practice feeling chill with being on your own.

Instead of logging onto Facebook or sending a mass text every time you feel lonely, think about the two or five or 10 people who really matter to you, and make it a priority to connect with them via a phone call, FaceTime, or Zoom happy hour in the coming weeks. These conversations can be short and don’t have to be deep or serious to be “meaningful.” Joking around and shooting the shit with your co-worker pals can go a long way. (And if you still have time for social media conversations after this, great!)

You might be tempted to spend a lot of time on social media, where, theoretically, there are always people to “talk to.” But passively receiving updates and interacting in small snippets with loose acquaintances takes time and energy that might be better spent deepening more established relationships (even relatively new ones). Part of building the solitude skill is learning to deal more directly with loneliness, so you can create space for yourself to comfortably be alone, in actual solitude.

You might be surprised by how many people will be more responsive to a clear expression of a feeling versus you trying to “show” that you’re lonely in indirect ways (“I’m so bored lmao haven’t talked to anyone in days”). So often, our needs aren't nearly as obvious as we think they are; if you haven’t used the word “lonely” yet, make a point to do that ASAP.

It can be hard to be vulnerable with other people, but if there was ever a time… it's this moment, when we’re literally all vulnerable. You’re definitely not the only person who's figuring out how to be away from others right now, and telling people that can be a huge relief, make it possible for them to step in and show up for you, and demonstrate to those you care about that they're allowed and encouraged to talk about these things if they're feeling them, too.

The capacity for solitude is naturally inhibited by loneliness, which is why it’s important to think about both right now. The good news is that solitude is a buildable skill. So if you dread being physically alone (or not having your phone on you), or worry that not having a relationship or a friend group says something about you or your overall worth, solitude might be the thing to get “good” at. (More on how to do this in a bit.)

Start by being soft with yourself as much as you can; when negative or critical thoughts pop up, acknowledge their existence… but don’t follow them down a rabbit hole. Take a little time to do something corny (but effective! I’m sorry!!!) like making a list of your values, interests, priorities, best qualities, and/or recent successes, even if they’re small.

Intentionally opt into solitude.

There’s no way around it: Getting comfortable being alone takes practice. I’ve found that it’s helpful to be proactive about it; making a conscious choice to be alone with your thoughts for a set period of time (with a set end time) and taking baby steps feels way less overwhelming than having it suddenly foisted upon you because none of your friends are responding to your texts.

I can’t tell you what your solitude practice should look like, but I can tell you one thing that has been helpful for me whenever I’m avoiding myself: putting my phone in airplane mode, setting a timer for an hour, and reading a book. (I know I said above reading a book doesn’t count as full solitude, and while it’s still technically receiving an input, I find it’s better to start with something that feels fairly doable and will give me a lot of bang for my buck instead of chasing the perfection of complete and utter solitude and immediately giving up because I went too hard.)

I knew how easily I could get distracted while reading, so I made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t pause to look up a definition or reference online (and then start responding to texts without even realizing it). It was just me and my book for a whole-ass 60 minutes. The hour always flies by, and the practice has had a really positive impact on my life—not only did I read more, but my brain no longer felt like it was on fire. With each session, I felt like I was strengthening my being-alone muscles.

Pick up a few meditative habits or hobbies.

Meditation is a great way to get more comfortable with solitude (and I highly recommend the Headspace app if you want to give it a try). It’s also not everyone’s cup of tea, so a meditative-esque activity can be a helpful stand-in, and isn’t as intimidating as just sitting and doing nothing might feel right now.

Find something fairly repetitive, but still enjoyable and energizing. For me, that's doing puzzles, embroidery, cross-stitch, and hand-lettering; for you, it might be painting with watercolors, making pasta from scratch, or knitting. The idea is to keep your hands busy, but your mind free. If you want background noise, put on some music, but try to avoid other entertainment (Netflix, podcasts, etc.) and don’t document/share your progress as you go. Just be with yourself.

Put together a list of purposeful things to do by yourself when you get bored.

It’s so easy to wrack your brain trying to think of something to do, then pick up your phone out of habit, see you have an Instagram DM, and spend 90 minutes scrolling before you know what's happening. An easy way to avoid this is to just make a running list of things you're saving for later and come back to it if you’re feeling idle. Outside of practicing solitude, think about movies, TV shows, podcasts, games (the New York Times puzzles and games are good one-person options!), and books… and don’t forget about workouts, small home improvement projects, and fun dumb shit (like learning a viral TikTok dance or going down a Wikipedia rabbit hole).

Come up with a self-care accountability system.

In difficult times, it can be hard to remember to do basic tasks like showering, eating, drinking water, and moving your body. It’s even more difficult when you don’t have anyone to say, “Buddy, have you eaten since yesterday morning?” Create calendar notifications or set alarms to help you stay accountable for daily tasks. (I love the habit tracking app Done for this.)

Ask someone to check in on you.

It’s not weird or silly to want a daily, “Hey, are you alive?” text or phone call in these scary times. If you’re asking a neighbor or someone you’re not particularly close to to be the one to check in, make it clear to them that you’re just hoping for a very top-level welfare check, and that you aren’t expecting them to be your emotional rock right now. (This might sound something like, “I’m a little freaked out by living alone during all of this, and would feel a bit better if I knew someone was keeping an eye out. Could I ask you to [call me/knock on my door/text my sister] if there’s ever an instance when you haven’t heard from me all day?”)

Keep an eye on how much you’re drinking.

As VICE previously reported in relation to this pandemic, people often use drinking to replace relationships or to numb negative feelings… two things that you might be inclined to do right now. If that’s the case, it might be a good idea to start tracking how much you’re drinking and/or pause for a “Why am I actually doing this? What am I hoping to accomplish?” gut-check before each drink. (And if you’re thinking “if I wanted to do that reflection, I wouldn’t be drinking!” I strongly recommend reading that link above.)

If you’re worried about what you’ll do if you get sick, come up with a plan.

The situation with regard to COVID-19 testing and treatment is changing daily, so planning anything right now is a challenge. What you can do, if you feel like it would put your mind at ease, is make a doc with some rough plans that you can update as needed.",,
What Is the Fanciest Restaurant in Rome?,"This article originally appeared on VICE Italy.

Italy has many luxurious restaurants, but none as unapologetically opulent as Rome’s La Pergola. Sitting atop the Rome Cavalieri hotel, the three Michelin star restaurant has been run by German chef Heinz Beck, maître d’ Simone Pinoli and sommelier Marco Reitano for 23 years.

Diners wait in the hotel lobby for the lift to the top floor, in the company of artworks including Bertel Thorvaldsen’s famed neoclassical bronze statue Shepherd Boy with his Dog, Andy Warhol’s Dollar Sign series and a triptych by Rococo master Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (currently on loan to a private museum in Milan). I’d always dreamed of finding out what luxuries await upstairs – then, one day, I got invited for lunch.

After two decades in the business, maître d’ Pinoli and sommelier Reitano have a knack for reading their clients and putting them at ease. Just one way they make you feel special is by providing your own personalised napkin – that is, if they really like you. “Each client is treated with the exact same dedication,” Pinoli said. “However, we reserve special attention for our regular customers and the ones we are especially fond of.”

The coveted napkins are hand-embroidered with clients’ initials in gold thread, and kept in a special wooden chest of drawers for years to come. They’re so exclusive that some diners even offer money to get their hands on them. “That’s the worst thing you could do to try and get one,” said Pinoli.

Marco Reitano (sommelier) and Simone Pinoli (maître).

Napkins aside, the whole dining experience at La Pergola is, quite frankly, insane.

“I’ll leave the water list here, sir,” Pinoli said after I was seated. Trying to look unfazed, I gave him a nod as if he’d just handed to me the wine list. When I took a glance, it had 55 (Fifty Five) different types of water on it. The list featured Chateldon, King Louis XIV of France’s favourite water, Magma, a naturally bubbly water from below the earth’s crust, and Svalbardi, a water extracted from actual icebergs after being frozen for over 40,000 years.

Picking fancy water is hard – if you’re as inexperienced as me, at least – so I went for the one with the most fascinating backstory: Magma. My bubbly volcano water was served in a glamorous black bottle at the end of the meal, to help with digestion. It was, without a doubt, the best water I have ever drunk in my life.

Of course, the food was delicious too. The highlight of the lunch was one of the restaurant’s specialities, blended foie gras with red berries, a bright pink and extra-bougie version of the luxurious French classic.

Before writing this piece, I’d heard wild stories about La Pergola while researching another article. When Sommelier Marco Reitano told me that one of his waiters once dressed up as a gladiator to entertain a child, I realised you can pretty much ask for anything there.

For instance, you might need a last-minute blazer to wear at dinner, since you’re required to wear one to be served. The staff keep single-breasted, navy blue blazers in sizes 42 to 64 just in case, and have them carefully dry-cleaned after each use. They also have reading glasses on hand, but since the pandemic hit they can’t hand them out. Instead, they offer a specialised reading lamp that apparently makes letters on a page appear more defined.

La Pergola.

In a bid to keep things as classy as possible in the age of ugly face masks and social distancing, the restaurant had to rethink some of its services. “We’ve worked things out so we can keep 95 percent of the experience at top level,” Pinoli said. The restaurant’s menu is personal and can be taken home; the wine list is digital, but if you want to have a look at the real thing they’ll happily provide you with gloves.

The sommelier is always available to “really guide guests in their choice”, according to Pinoli – which is handy, considering the wine menu has 3,500 options. In fact, there are two wine lists, one for Italian wines and one for international wines, both including bottles you won’t find in any other restaurant.

But the beverage extravaganza doesn’t stop there. At the end of your meal, you’re ushered to the Cigar Room and presented with a selection of precious cigars and 15 types of tea and coffee, amid sumptuous sofas and original artworks. “In the past, we used to serve a lot more cigars,” Pinoli said, adding that the ritual is not as popular today. “We try to adapt. We have a cocktail bar that follows the latest trends,” he said.

If you opt for a herbal infusion, your waiter will usher in a trolley with fresh plants and flowers, cut them on the spot and infuse them in a dedicated metal container called a samovar, formerly owned by Tzar Alexander I of Russia. “To make the experience even more dramatic, the tea is then transferred to a small glass jug containing liquid nitrogen,” Pinoli said. “The infusion is then personalised with essential oils chosen by the client.”

The coffee service is similarly spectacular, with a selection of beans from mysterious corners of the planet going for €14 a cup. One type from Mount Everest, for instance, is one of the only coffee beans to be naturally produced above the Tropic of Cancer. Then there’s the Kopi Luwak – the rarest coffee in the world, with less than 500kg roasted yearly – whose beans are eaten and then expelled by Asian palm civets. Apparently it takes a tiny mammal’s poo to make coffee taste delicious. This product is now widely condemned by environmentalists, as the civets are often caged in harsh conditions, even when the coffee is labelled as being produced by “wild civets”.

Last but not least, La Pergola is also available for lavish private parties and events (in non-pandemic times). “A while back, a very important Russian client wanted to celebrate his wife’s birthday with us, and rented out the whole restaurant [for €35,000],” Pinoli said.",,
Underground Hoodfights Amsterdam,"This article originally appeared on VICE NL.

A few weeks ago, I found myself in a deserted parking lot in Beverwijk, a Dutch town some 20km outside of Amsterdam. About 20 guys wearing face masks were standing around the lot and staring me down. Finally, one of them stepped forward. “I’m Migi,” said a big guy wearing a red baseball cap and a vest.

Migi is short for Miguel Bustamente. He’s behind Hoodfights Amsterdam, an Instagram account live-streaming illegal kickboxing matches from around the city. Since its launch in late May, the account has gathered more than 30,000 followers, and it’s not the only one – illegal fighting matches have started popping up all over the Netherlands.

At the end of June, a fight in Helmond – a town in the south of the Netherlands – descended into chaos, as an audience of 150 people rioted against police.

Miguel Bustamente aka Migi.

Spectators stepping out of their car.

Migi says he doesn’t have anything to do with that group. “Those were kids who wanted as many people as possible to show up for their fight,” he said. “We keep our location secret.”

The idea behind Hoodfights Amsterdam is simple: two guys fight each other, and their battle is streamed live on social media. The Instagram account often publicly announces a different location for the fight to throw off police. “It’s a game of cat and mouse,” said Choppa, one of today’s fighters.

“The cops have stopped by some of the guys’ homes a few times,” Migi said. Fighting on the street is considered an act of public violence in the Netherlands, and is illegal. Plus, during the pandemic, the government mandates people to stay one-and-a-half metres away from one another, which is obviously impossible during a fight.

But Migi thinks there’s nothing wrong with a bit of friendly, open-air sparring. “We just need to make sure we stay away from busy neighbourhoods as not to disturb the peace,” he said, which is why we were standing in an empty lot surrounded by farmland.

A man wrapping one of the fighters' hands in preparation for the match.

“I’ve been watching these kinds of fights from the US on the internet for years,” Migi explained. They’re what made the name of Kimbo Slice, a street-fighter turned viral internet sensation who ultimately worked with the UFC, the biggest MMA organisation in the world. Jorge Masvidal, another UFC star, got his start on the streets, too.

“The goal is to ultimately transition to YouTube,” Migi said, “maybe make some money if we get a lot of views.” He’s also considering finding sponsors among the account’s Instagram followers. As of now, the fighters simply pitch in money and the winner takes all.

I asked Migi if he was prepared for things to get out of hand during one of his fights. Someone could lose consciousness, or the audience could try to join in, for instance. “That’s not going to happen with us,” Migi said. “All of our fights are friendly.” He insists the matches aren’t “a platform for people to settle personal arguments”, and that the guys just fight for entertainment. “But the battle is real,” he said.

Two guys posing before the match.

The fight.

This match was between Choppa and VK, two members of the up-and-coming Amsterdam-based drill group 73 De Pijp. Their most recent album, Crimelife 1.0, has already been streamed millions of times since its release in February. Both Choppa and VK can be described as sizeable guys. Choppa was wearing shorts and a Paris-Saint Germain sweatshirt, VK was in a grey tracksuit and a hoodie.

“Bro, are you ready to go down?” Choppa yelled to VK. I asked a random bystander who he thought would win. “It’s hard,” he said. “Choppa is experienced, but VK is flexible and has those high kicks.” The two were handed a pair of boxing gloves and a mouth guard before the match. “Wait a second – my dick,” said Choppa, while rearranging his pants.

Migi gestured for the audience to stay back, as the audience grabbed their phones to record the fight. “This is the referee,” Migi announced, placing his hand on the shoulder of a guy named Tommie. “This guy decides everything. And I don’t want to hear complaints about it,” he added. Then he turned to the camera: “Ladies and gentlemen, we’re starting.”

VK immediately went for a low kick and Choppa punched back into VK’s defence. “He’s afraid, bro!” someone yelled from Choppa’s corner, while VK kept his defence high. Both boxers are quite heavy, so their punches were powerful but also tiring. Choppa threw a few jabs right before the end of the first round. Then the fighters went to the opposite ends of the parking lot.

Round two started with Choppa handing out a few hard blows to VK’s head. VK tried to escape with some fast footwork, but quickly lost his breath. Choppa had a lot of energy, considering his weight, and finished strong in the second round, with another knee strike and a high kick.

Choppa, the winner of today's fight.

Before the third round, the fighters shared a friendly fist bump. They both went in hard from the start: Choppa did a few roundhouse kicks, only narrowly escaped by VK. The audience howled and the fighters started really going at each other. Choppa’s nose was bleeding, but he kept throwing punches, while VK was once again out of breath. The guys left it all in the ring, with Choppa coming out on top during the final part of the match.

“Time!” referee Tommie shouted, to the audience’s applause. Choppa and VK fell into an embrace, laughing, and took a picture together. “Nothing but love, boys,” said Migi. “Lots of respect for you both, you put up a good fight,” said the referee. He raised Choppa’s hand in the air. The guys got another round of applause, and VK a few pats on the back.",,
Italy's Anti-Lockdown Protests Turn Violent as Far-Right Take to the Streets,"Italy is in the midst of a severe second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, after doctors and scientists desperately called on citizens to “stay home”, local authorities from the hardest-hit regions decided to impose curfew measures at night time. On Sunday, the Italian government issued a new decree, forcing bars and restaurants to close at 6PM, while theatres, gyms, swimming pools and cinemas across the county have all been shut.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has promised financial aid to mitigate the economic impact of the measures. According to some estimates, the new restrictions could cost €17 billion in the final quarter of the year.

Earlier in the spring, during the first lockdown, Italians happily complied to the government’s guidelines. But things have changed: people have been struggling to make ends meet over the past few months, and there’s a widespread feeling that a massive economic crisis might be on the horizon. Protests initially broke out in Naples, in the south of the country, and spread to northern cities. Most were peaceful, but there were a few episodes of violence.

On Monday, bar owners gathered in Rome’s central Piazza Trilussa, and poured beer kegs and cans on the ground as a symbol of their losses. In Cremona, a small city in Lombardy, restaurateurs left pans and ladles in front of the city hall as a sign of protest. In Treviso and Vicenza, two wealthy cities near Venice, thousands of business owners and workers gathered in crowds in the historical city centres, begging authorities to let them work.

The protests have been supported by right-wing politicians, including Alan Fabbri, a member of the far-right Lega party, who spoke out in solidarity with workers from the city of Ferrara, 50km north of Bologna. During the protests in Trieste, mayor Roberto Dipiazza and governor of the Veneto region Massimiliano Fedriga accused Conte of neglecting the interests of the regions, a talking point often used to discredit Rome’s authority.

The far-right took the stage in at least three regions – Verona and Latina, two cities where the neo-fascist groups are very vocal, and in Rome. On the 24th of October 2020, when the curfew was announced in the Lazio region, 200 militants from the neo-fascist party Forza Nuova gathered in the central Piazza del Popolo to protest against the “sanitary dictatorship” supposedly imposed by the Italian government.

By midnight, the neo-fascists had exploded smoke bombs and fireworks, and thrown objects at the police officers who were trying to disperse them. They set some dumpsters on fire and damaged vehicles on their way out. In the end, two officers were injured and ten protesters were stopped by the police.

More turmoil happened in Naples, Milan and Turin. On the 23rd of October, hundreds of protesters clashed with the police outside the regional administrative building in Naples. According to governor Vincenzo De Luca, among them there were renowned members of the Camorra, football ultras and neo-fascists. Many argued that the majority of the crowd was actually made up of precarious workers, now at risk of losing their jobs.

In Turin, hundreds of people clashed with police officers in the central Piazza Castello. After the police used tear gas, some protesters destroyed and looted luxury shops, like the Gucci shop in Via Roma. The police arrested ten people, half of whom were members of Juventus’ official fan group. Many protesters, according to footage circulated on social media, were young and came from the outskirts of the city.

On Monday night in Milan, one of the cities hit the hardest by the pandemic, a protest took place in the city centre, made up of around 300 mostly young people. Some threw firecrackers and a molotov cocktail against a police car, while shouting “freedom, freedom, freedom”.

According to Roberto Maggioni, a journalist at Radio Popolare, it was not an organised protest. Police stopped and identified 28 people, of whom 13 were underage. Beside one girl, who belonged to an anarchist movement, no one else had any affiliation with known political groups.",,
I'm Sick of Working From Home So I Tried Being A Digital Nomad For a Week,"This article was originally published on VICE Netherlands.

I was pretty disappointed when Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte announced that working from home would continue beyond September.

For me, this meant many more months of being forced to listen to my roommate’s favourite YouTubers and my neighbour using every power tool he owns. Many more months with this view:

The author's wall.

I never thought I’d say this, but here it goes: I miss the office. There’s nothing like working in a place that’s actually designed for work. Or being surrounded by others who are also working, or at least seem to be.

But working from home does have an advantage I hadn’t explored up until recently: you technically don’t have to do it from your actual home. For one week, I searched for the best places to work beyond my cursed walls.

Here are the highlights:

VANLIFE

A quick Google brought me to Kay and Esther, who have ditched office life for the road. They met while working at the same marketing agency in Amsterdam, fell in love and, in 2018, decided to quit the 9 to 5 and embrace #VanLife. They explored New Zealand for six months – in a hired van – and recently returned from the Swiss Alps.

For now, their van is temporarily parked in Esther’s parents’ driveway in Assen, northeast Netherlands, while they’re staying in the house. To them, this feels like a holiday. “Living on the road, always being on the move, it’s definitely stressful,” said Esther. “You get to see the most beautiful places on Earth, and I wouldn’t want to miss out on any of it. But it’s not a holiday. It really is a lifestyle.”

They discovered early on that a comfortable van is a must. “By now, we’ve created a good working space. We levelled the table so we can sit up straight and there is enough power,” Esther explained. They’ve also added the luxury of air conditioning.

Having a sense of structure is also important. The pair work from their van five days a week, from nine to four with a one-hour break. They update their blog, do some freelance marketing and create manuals for building your own caravan. “When work is finished, you close your laptop and go enjoy the mountains. That’s the great thing about living in a van. You can choose the view from your window,” Kay said.

Unfortunately, right now that view consists of a brick wall in a suburb of Assen – and despite Kay and Esther claiming they’re both great co-workers, I’m currently not allowed to share a space with them due to the pandemic. With that in mind, I spend the next few hours typing away by myself. I can’t say the view is an upgrade from home, but ergonomically speaking my situation has improved. After sitting on my old, wobbly kitchen chairs for months, van life is surprisingly comfortable.

The Amstel Hotel is great.

THE LUXURY HOTEL

The van was nice, but if I can truly work from anywhere, I’d rather somewhere a little more upmarket. Amsterdam’s famous Amstel Hotel also provides a great view, but here, you can enjoy it from a gorgeous room with lush green carpeting.

The only issue is the abundance of tableware: a sugar and milk-set, napkins with a silver ring around them, a small candle in a porcelain holder, pink flowers in a tiny vase. There’s so much stuff on the table, there’s barely any room left for my laptop. In short: things could be worse, and minor annoyances are easily smoothed over by the free butter cookie served with every cup of drip coffee (at €5 apiece) and the delightful easy-listening jazz in the background.

Everyone here seems to be having an equally good time. The couple next to me round out their lunch with champagne and a macaron tower. An older gentleman in a turtleneck is being fed by his wife (or mistress), and a group of women dial up the volume after each consecutive glass of wine.

The longer I stay, the more I feel my laptop and I are sucking the fun out of the room. My typing sounds like a passive aggressive counter-soundtrack to the laughter and clinking of glasses. It’s like I’ve been planted here to remind guests of the real world, where people have to work during the day. I don’t want to be that asshole. As I pack up after my third cup of coffee, my heart breaks a little.

My workspace in the cemetery.

THE CEMETERY

I end up somewhere only goths and doggers have fun: a cemetery. The dead certainly make for quiet co-workers, plus it smells like pine trees and I’m surrounded by squirrels and butterflies. Like computer monitors in an office, the neat rows of headstones provide a sense of calm. Mourners walk past me as I sit alone on a bench. I’m in the perfect mood to write, but suddenly feel bad about opening my laptop. Here, the sound of my typing wouldn’t ruin anyone’s party, but it would definitely disturb the silence.

So, instead, I fire off a few emails, all tinged with melancholy, until my sense of focus is disturbed by someone across the street mowing their lawn. Almost simultaneously, the ringtone alerting people of visiting hours blasts across the grounds. Even among the dead, silence is elusive.

The office in the Ikea showroom.

THE IKEA SHOWROOM

The office section of IKEA’s showroom is the perfect work environment. There’s a power board for my laptop charger, the Järvfjället office chair is ergonomic perfection and the Bekånt room divider enables me to pound the keyboard in relative privacy.

The endless stream of customers passing by gives me a comforting feeling of normalcy: people are still livening up their living quarters with new furniture. It’s like having a front row seat at the revival of our economy. A woman bends over my desk while talking to someone on the phone. “It looks good, and you can adjust the height!” she says of my setup.

She’s right! It is a good desk. Her positivity works wonders on me, as does the motivational slogan right above my head: “Let’s talk business, we’re here for you!”

Before I know it, more than an hour has passed and I’ve written half a story. I wonder what I should tell people when they ask me what I’m doing here. If I answer “I work here” they might rope me into helping them pick a cupboard. But saying “I don’t work here” would be a lie. These are the challenges of life as a digital nomad. Luckily, nobody asks me anything and it’s ultimately the rumbling of my stomach that propels me to the IKEA restaurant.",,
I Can't Donate Plasma to COVID Research Because I Had Sex with a Man 3 Years Ago,"This article originally appeared on VICE Netherlands.

Scientists all over the world are working furiously to develop both a vaccine and a treatment for the novel coronavirus. As ordinary citizens, we can’t put the gloves on and join them in the lab – but if you believe you’ve had COVID-19, one way you can contribute is by donating plasma to your local blood bank.

Plasma is a yellow liquid that makes up 55 percent of our blood, and contains antibodies. Globally, COVID-19 patients are currently being treated with plasma from the recovered, in the hopes that their antibodies will help to fight the virus. In the past, plasma has been used to treat viruses like rabies, hepatitis B and chickenpox.

More clinical trials are needed to establish whether the treatment is effective against COVID-19, but the US Federal Drug Authority (FDA) approved it as “potentially promising” on the 23rd of August. Meanwhile, scientists from different countries, including the UK and the Netherlands, are collecting plasma as part of a global study into its effects on the virus. Preliminary results are expected in autumn.

Wouter Ubbink, 22, thinks he contracted COVID-19 in late March. “One of my roommates is a doctor and tested positive,” Ubbink explained over the phone. “I had the same symptoms: a week in bed, ill with a fever. I didn’t get tested because there was a limited capacity [in the Netherlands] at the time, but I probably had it.”

As a long-time donor to the Dutch blood bank Sanquin, Ubbink decided to sign up for plasma donations as well. But when he called to set up an appointment, he was told his plasma wouldn’t be accepted. The reason? He’d had sex with a man three-and-a-half years ago.

Many countries don’t allow men who’ve had sex with men to donate blood. But in the Netherlands, your blood is accepted as long as the most recent sexual encounter happened more than four months before the donation. A Sanquin spokesperson said these restrictions are applied specifically to men who have sex with men because “certain infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B and HIV, are much more common within that group”.

The company tests all donations for diseases, but some viruses like hepatitis B take up to four months to show. The four-month rule also applies to other high-risk donor categories, such as people who’ve just had surgery or those who’ve recently been to Sub-Saharan Africa. The blood bank’s rules could be considered discriminatory against gay men, but in 2019 they were deemed legitimate for public health reasons by the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights, an independent body that investigates human rights violations in the country.

In Ubbink’s case, it’s been years since he had sex with a man. But the Sanquin spokesperson pointed out that his plasma could end up being used outside of the Netherlands, since labs all over the world are cooperating to develop the treatment. “We have to abide by international rules, otherwise we can’t participate,” they said, while stressing that Sanquin wasn’t happy with the current situation. “The Netherlands is too small to do this on its own,” they said.

Good intentions or not, the blood bank is hiding behind international rules. Meanwhile, the Dutch regulations are still unclear. In 2015, the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights decided Sanquin could not permanently ban a man from donating blood because of his past sexual relations with men. But the institute’s decision doesn’t apply to plasma and isn’t legally binding, although it could be cited in court in case of a lawsuit.

“I understand that this is a tough decision,” said Ubbink, “But ultimately, it’s based on conservative norms in other countries.” The institute is currently investigating Ubbink’s case, with results pending. For now, a spokesperson told VICE News that they are unable to comment on ongoing cases. Meanwhile, Wouter said he hopes both Sanquin and Dutch politicians will pressure the international community to change their approach.",,
John McDonnell Explains Why Boris Johnson Is a ‘Proto-Fascist’,"As Britain teeters on the edge of a second coronavirus lockdown, former shadow chancellor and left-wing Labour luminary John McDonnell MP is explaining why he believes Boris Johnson’s days are numbered.

“What will happen, almost certainly, I would have thought, is the Tory party will realise they can’t cope with Johnson any longer,” says McDonnell. “His incompetence is exposed, and he’s going to become a liability. Then they replace him with Rishi Sunak, who the establishment media are building up as the saviour of the moment.”

McDonnell knows chancellor Rishi Sunak all too well. As Labour’s shadow chancellor for almost five years, the 69-year old once branded the “enemy of capitalism” was working opposite Sunak and alongside outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn when the coronavirus crisis began.

These were the dying days of Corbyn and McDonnell’s unlikely journey from the outer reaches of Labour’s left-wing to the heart of the party and back out again. In 2015, when it all began, McDonnell was seen as the harder of the hard left pair, throwing down a copy of Mao’s Little Red Book in the House of Commons and carrying with him a reputation as a socialist fixer.

But he was a canny politician, too. His image softened considerably. He sought to build bridges between the Labour left and the City of London. He lunched with the FT. He tried to show the country that socialist economics were just simple common sense.

Ironically, the outbreak of the pandemic might have helped with that. Over the months that followed, Sunak adopted emergency measures that looked almost McDonnell-like in their harnessing of state resources. The Conservative chancellor became the darling of many pundits, with LBC’s James O’Brien heralding his budget as “fascinating and potentially excellent”, and The Observer’s Nick Cohen saying that if Sunak were a Labour politician “Momentum activists would be cheering themselves hoarse”. The BBC portrayed the chancellor as a cartoon superhero and Vogue told its readers, “Admit it: You fancy Rishi Sunak.”

McDonnell isn’t swooning. “He’s handed over power to the exploiters and profiteers,” says McDonnell of the Tory chancellor, over the phone from his home in Hillingdon, west London. “All the policies he pursues are to protect his friends in capital.” The government, the Labour man says, has “demonstrated a criminal level of incompetence” in its handling of the pandemic, and been “criminally negligent” in its treatment of frontline workers. What’s more, he continues, the Conservatives have failed to use this emergency to lay the foundations for tackling the climate crisis, and the story about them using the levers of the state to protect its people is just that: a story.

“Let’s be realistic,” McDonnell says. “Before I went as shadow chancellor, we submitted a whole series of policy papers and whatever to Sunak, including the proposal for the furlough, including the support for self-employed. We also submitted proposals about how you lay the foundations in this crisis for tackling climate change. He has been forced into implementation of a range of those policies, but it’s been like drawing teeth. It’s always too slow, never on the scale needed.”

McDonnell is speaking to me after the opening summit of Progressive International (PI), an organisation that aims to connect and mobilise leftist movements across the globe. As one member of the PI team puts it to me, “Evil is organised globally, the forces for good have to be too.” The three-day series of events was, the organisation said, convened to “confront the central dilemma of our time: Internationalism or Extinction”, and ended on Sunday with a declaration that “there is an alternative” to the political and economic system burning our planet to the ground.

The summit placed the Liverpool-born McDonnell alongside such figures of the international left as Yanis Varoufakis, Cornel West (“I love the man, I can’t help it,” says McDonnell) and Naomi Klein. Clad in his trademark red V-neck jumper, the British politician was in his element, bringing the experience of almost half a century of socialist struggle to the proceedings.

“I think it’s a great initiative,” McDonnell says of Progressive International. “It’s been tried so many times, and it had to happen because of the pressure that’s upon us… I’ll throw everything I can into it.” On Friday, PI council member Noam Chomsky, invoking the climate crisis, called for a kind of “panic” that organises and energises people. McDonnell also believes the climate crisis is the defining “existential threat” of our era.

But there is also a crisis of democracy, with – as Varoufakis puts it – “two authoritarian internationalisms wrecking humanity’s prospects”. These ascendant forces are “the captains of banks and corporations whose interests the liberal establishment serves globally”, and the “xenophobic nationalists” promising their citizens a restoration of pride and happiness by “turning them against the migrant, the foreigner, the ‘other’”.

In McDonnell’s eyes, Johnson falls firmly into that latter camp. He recently told Italian newspaper la Repubblica that the prime minister’s politics are “proto-fascism”, and went on to call Johnson a “proto-fascist” at the PI summit.

“That expression was really to make sure our own people within our own movement rediscovered some of the analysis of the past that actually applies to today,” McDonnell says. “The concept of proto-fascism is that actually you are identifying the traits within an individual or a movement that could lead you to fascism. In terms of this country, it would be conservative authoritarianism, and I think that’s what we are facing.”

The prime minister, McDonnell says, has a “complete disregard” for domestic and international law, for parliament and parliamentary accountability, and for the nation’s judges. He has “a supplicant media, a party that’s taking money from foreign donors – and at the same time is awarding contracts to close associates and, when there’s a civil servant who stands up and actually says this is wrong, they get pushed out very quickly. All of those traits are those undermining a democracy, and I think you have to warn people about this.”

“Every day was just a struggle to survive.”

McDonnell says he’s trying to get new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and his team to see that Johnson “will always go for nationalism – and he’ll tinge it with racism and anti-migrant language”. In response to that, says McDonnell, Labour needs to demonstrate that it is the “community party”.

The former shadow chancellor is also trying to get Labour to link Johnson to Sunak, and to call out the government for “the very limited accountability and the corruption that might be taking place” in its distribution of resources.

Are Starmer and his team brave enough to do that? “I think so,” says McDonnell. “That’s what I’m trying to persuade them to do, and if they have some anxieties about that, then that story can be told from the back benches.”

Reflecting on Corbyn’s time as leader, his old friend says, “Every day was just a struggle to survive, so energies got sapped into just survival.”

“Before Jeremy ran for the leadership I did have a plan,” he says, with a wry chuckle. That plan was to run a candidate from the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, pick up 20 to 25 percent of the votes, to show there was a left-wing constituency within the Labour Party, and to build a social movement from there.

McDonnell had tried this before, in 2007, when he challenged Gordon Brown for the leadership. “I never got onto the ballot paper,” he laughs. “The whole purpose was to plant a flag for people to rally around and build that social movement. That’s how you bring about a revolution, you know?”

“I look back on it, and I think it was cart before the horse. We won the leadership before we built the social movement, it should have been the other way round.”

He wasn’t surprised by this resistance within his party, and says the tactics they used were “completely expected as well”. The co-ordinated resignation of much of Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet in 2016 was an echo then-defence minister Tom Watson’s attempt to oust Tony Blair on behalf of Gordon Brown in 2006, a year before Brown actually took over. When I ask McDonnell if Watson – deputy leader under Corbyn, and now advising gambling giant Flutter Entertainment on corporate social responsibility – might try to bring his new masters down, he laughs heartily: “There’s a joke in there about, ‘I wouldn’t put a bet on it.’”

The morning after we speak, Starmer gives his first conference speech as Labour leader. Standing behind a lectern bearing the slogan, “A New Leadership”, Starmer’s main message is exactly that: “Take another look at Labour,” he says. “We’re under new leadership.”

I message McDonnell to ask if he feels a little insulted.

“The speech,” he replies. “It’s not a problem and completely predictable. I am philosophical about these things and assess matters very much as a political artisan. Any incoming leader after an election defeat will want to distance themselves from the past. The more important question is not who interprets the past but who wins the future. That’s all to play for.”",,
A Brief Timeline of the UK Government’s Contradictory Coronavirus Messaging,"On Tuesday night, Boris Johnson announced to the nation what many knew was inevitable: new, tighter restrictions would be put in place following a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and hospital admissions. Socialising in groups larger than six would be banned, and people are once again encouraged to work from home.

“The iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths,” Johnson said, threatening increased fines of £10,000 for rule breakers.

This is an ever so slightly different message to the one the government had been pedalling just two months earlier, when Johnson promised “significant normality” by Christmas. So, what happened? How has the government’s advice on COVID-19 evolved, and how many times has it changed its mind before? Here is a timeline of the often contradictory official advice Britain has been subject to since the start of the pandemic.

March and April

At the beginning of March, Boris Johnson’s main public health message is that people should wash their hands while singing “Happy Birthday” twice. He boasts about shaking hands “with everybody” at a hospital with confirmed coronavirus patients, even as his advisors warn people not to use the greeting.

By late March, lockdown is declared. Britons are told that they should only leave their homes if it is absolutely essential. Outdoor exercise is limited to once per day.

Forget “Take Back Control” or even “Get Brexit Done”, the government’s new phrase – “Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives” – is repeated ad nauseum by anyone with an ounce of authority. Even Doctor Who records a video uttering the phrase.

May

The government announces an easing of lockdown measures. For the first time in weeks, people can leave their homes more than once a day, and go to the park without risk of arrest.

But ministers appear to be worried that the British people have internalised the “Stay Home” message too wholeheartedly. The official government line changes to a milder “Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives” – just don’t ask exactly what “staying alert” means.

Boris Johnson’s chief advisor Dominic Cummings dominates the headlines for over a week, as news that he broke lockdown rules to travel to 264 miles to Durham while believing he had the virus emerges. In a public statement, Cummings explains that an additional 30-mile drive to the town of Barnard Castle was in order to test his eyesight in case it had been affected by the virus. Ministers stretch credibility to defend him, sending the clearest message yet from the government to the public.

Johnson says that Britain will have a “world-beating” track-and-trace system by June.

June

Things go from bad to worse for the government’s contact tracing plans. Matt Hancock finally admits defeat, and announces that the app will go back to the drawing board.

July

Further easing of COVID-19 restrictions allows pubs to re-open for the first time. Celebrating the measures, Johnson urges Britons to “do their patriotic best” by going for a pint.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces the Eat Out To Help Out scheme, which sees the government subsidise meals in restaurants during August to up to £10 on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights.

August

The government pulls a screeching U-turn, conceding that wearing masks in schools is probably a good idea.

Britons continue to return to normal. Eat Out To Help Out proves incredibly popular. According to the Treasury, over 64 million meals are claimed by restaurants as part of the scheme. It is hailed as a brilliant success that will in no way come back to haunt the government.

Cinemas are allowed to reopen by the end of the month. Plans are announced to bring back live audiences at sporting events in October.

As deaths hit new lows of just single digits per day, the government begins to encourage people to return to office. “Go back to work or risk losing your job”, reads one memorable Telegraph front page.

September

Coronavirus cases start to rise again. Time for a new government slogan: “Hands, Face, Space”. Aimed at reminding Britons to wash their hands, cover their face and social distance, it does not appear to catch on.

As a result of the increasing numbers, the government toughens up the rules again. The “rule of six” is introduced, reducing the number of people allowed to gather at any one time from 30 to six.

Home Secretary Priti Patel says that she would report neighbours to the police for breaking the new rules, while Johnson says he wouldn’t, unless there was some kind of “Animal House party” taking place.

Britons are once again told to work from home if they can. Plans to bring back live sports are scrapped. Pubs have now been ordered to close at 10PM, with the threat of further restrictions if the situation worsens.",,
"Yes, You Can Get Sexually Harassed While Working at Home Too","Friday night drinks used to be the closest coworkers got to muddying the work-life balance, but thanks to COVID, working from home has now granted colleagues unlimited access to each other. For some, this means little more than streams of notifications and having to mute WhatsApp. Others have been left to navigate inappropriate messages, sexual advances and Zoom calls that unwittingly allow colleagues a peek of their bedrooms.

When IT worker Eva* received an email telling her she’d have to work from home for the foreseeable future, she breathed a sigh of relief. Not only had an already gruelling commute caused a spike in her anxiety, the atmosphere at work had become increasingly tense since she reported an ex-colleague for sexual harassment. Working in a predominantly male environment had become isolating, with many refusing to work with her.

As she worked from the comfort of her sofa, the weight of being the source of office gossip eased. But it was quickly replaced with a more sinister discomfort when one of her directors started requesting one-to-one video calls.

“It’s very uncomfortable,” she says. “He asks about my personal life and comments on my appearance, and then brushes it off as just caring about my wellbeing.”

Although Eva knows the individual meetings with her director are unnecessary and inappropriate, their online setting makes the power dynamic painfully obvious. There’s no way for Eva to decline the calls without jeopardising her precarious position at work, and being confined to her flat makes it impossible to avoid his calls, she told VICE.

The only silver lining is the infrequency of the meetings, but even that is counteracted by the constant flirting and unsolicited pictures that Eva receives from another senior staff member, whom she has to work closely with on a daily basis. “He keeps saying I could be in his support bubble and asking to come over as he lives very close by.”

Eva doesn’t think he’ll actually turn up at her flat, but the virtual threat makes her feel like he’s already at her door. The mindless scrolling that once helped her unwind has been hijacked, and every phone notification is now a source of anxiety. Thanks to her new WFH reality, her harassers can invade her personal space and leave her stomach in knots from a distance, leaving Eva feeling powerless in her own home.

Online abuse disproportionately affects women, and because online usage has doubled since the start of lockdown in the UK, women’s groups are concerned about what this means for victims’ mental wellbeing and safety.

Lauren Pemberton-Nelson, senior communications coordinator at Glitch, a charity working towards ending online abuse, said the sense of anonymity and physical distance created by online spaces can be a gateway for harassment.

""With technology and the use of technological means, people may communicate with colleagues digitally in ways that they wouldn't before,” she explains.

Sophia* experienced this firsthand when an older colleague she’d met only a handful of times punctured an entirely professional conversation with a joke about sexting. “He was able to make me feel that smallness you feel when somebody speaks to you in that way,” she says. “I didn't even reply.”

In person, Sophia feels confident that she’d be able to shut the conversation down and translate her discomfort verbally. But drafting a message is a whole different ball game. With a flashing cursor willing a response to be tapped out, there’s more room for the pressure to pile on. “With the time to consider and really give thought to what I would want to say,” Sophia says, “I still couldn't bring myself to do it.”

Struggling to deal with the situation – and believing she’d be supported – Sophia decided to confide in her manager. She was shocked when her experience was brushed off with comments about the perpetrator being a good person. “She’ll wear a feminist T-shirt but she won’t escalate reports of sexual harassment.”

Employers failing to take cases of workplace misconduct seriously isn’t uncommon, but policing harassment in online spaces can be even more daunting than doing it in person. Despite the fact that they’re the ones being victimised, it can also exacerbate the sense of responsibility and guilt that women feel.

Too often, victims of online abuse internalise the idea that it’s a misunderstanding and are expected to solve the harassment themselves, and the absence of physical threat means it’s not met with the seriousness it deserves. But it’s almost impossible to block or mute someone you’re supposed to be remotely working with, and being physically confronted with your harasser is becoming an imminent possibility as more offices reopen.

Typically, only one in five women report workplace sexual harassment, fearing that they would lose their job or their claim wouldn’t be taken seriously. Even taking this into account, Vault Platform, an app used to document workplace misconduct, says it’s received an increasing number of reports as the threat of redundancy has increased amid COVID-19.

Deeba Syed, a senior legal officer at Rights of Women, an organisation offering a free legal advice line, said that those with ongoing cases are also vulnerable. “Women are telling us that employers are using the pandemic as an excuse to make those who have reported sexual harassment redundant, cut their wages or dismiss them altogether.”

With only three months to bring harassment claims to Employment Tribunals, a backlog of cases caused by COVID-19 means that women could be timed out of justice.

Tia*, who was sexually harassed by her CEO just six months into her job after graduating, is one of the many women experiencing delays in her case. Although her claim hasn’t reached the tribunal stage yet, little progress has been made since she reported the incident just days before staff were asked to work from home.

“I've spoken to two of the senior team about it, but very little has happened so far. COVID has definitely made it harder to handle.”

Tia doesn’t mind. The slow progress allows her to forget about it, especially with limited contact with her harasser. But she’s conscious that the decision to wait until it’s possible to speak to the perpetrator in person could be a stalling tactic.

Currently in the UK on a visa directly linked to her employment at the company, she’s worried about her future and returning to the office. Given the power her harasser holds, reporting him could eventually cost her her job, which would completely derail the life she’s built for herself in London.

For many, when and if they’ll return to work is uncertain. But for women being sexually harassed, the issues COVID-19 presents are magnified. Abuse of power occurs at every level – including those often in senior positions exploiting remote workspaces, management dismissing claims, and the aftermath that disproportionately harms victims. For many, it’s costing them their livelihoods and mental wellbeing at a time when both are at their most fragile.",,
The Tories' COVID-19 Plan Puts Their Voters Before Everyone Else,"The situation surrounding COVID-19 is changing by the day, meaning some of the information in this article might be out of date. For our most recent coronavirus coverage, click here.

For all that the government is finally ramping up its encouragement for us all sit inside refreshing our groupchats to beat coronavirus, as the crisis looms, people also need help economically. Yesterday Chancellor Rishi Sunak gave a statement to lay that out. In short, he gave businesses and homeowners a massive leg up while leaving workers and renters hanging.

Sunak stated that he’d be offering £330 billion worth of emergency loans to businesses – equivalent to 15 percent of the UK’s GDP – along with three month’s relief on mortgage payments and grants to smaller businesses. If businesses need more loans, the government will step forward and provide them.

This is a good first step given the significant economic risks of allowing businesses to default. Business have used the last decade of low interest rates to gorge themselves on cheap debt – total debt to British corporations is worth 82 percent of GDP, higher than in the US, where onlookers have been warning of a corporate debt bubble for years. Many economists have warned of the rise of “zombie firms” – poorly performing businesses that should have gone under, but which have been able to borrow to stay afloat.

The shock of coronavirus, which means an immediate loss of income, could tip many of these firms into bankruptcy. Thanks to the Chancellor’s intervention those with solid business models should be able to weather the storm. The issue is that these are still loans – not grants. Businesses are going to have to pay them back, so they’re simply going to add to the UK’s already high corporate debt burden over the long-term. If, as seems likely, the economic impact of the virus lasts more than two quarters, Sunak might need to take more drastic measures.

If you’re self-employed, work in the gig economy or live in the private rented sector, you’re probably waiting for the part where I tell you that Sunak has also announced a package of measures to top up incomes, freeze rents and freeze household debt repayments. Unfortunately, you’ll be disappointed.

The Chancellor has decided to provide relief for mortgage-holders – including landlords – but not private renters. And funnily enough, Twitter is already full of stories of landlords refusing to allow their tenants any leeway on paying their rent. The government announced today that it will be halting evictions until the crisis is over. Though many private renters will not react well to being considered an afterthought.

Should we be surprised? Probably not. Given the age-profile of homeowners compared to private renters, this is an explicit giveaway to Gen X and, to a lesser extent, boomers at the expense of millennials and Gen Z. In other words, the Conservative Party is ensuring their electoral coalition is safe. There has been enough outrage in response to the strategy that we may see a change of tack from the government over the coming weeks, but it shows where their priorities lie.

Meanwhile, the thousands of people who have been forced into self-isolation may not be able to pay their rent or bills with the UK’s statutory sick pay of just £94.25 per week. The self-employed, those on zero hours contracts and those who work in the gig economy may face a complete loss of work altogether. Many who work in entertainment have pointed to the callousness of the government’s decision to “advise” people to stay at home rather than “require” it, because it means entertainers and venues can’t claim for the loss of income on their insurance.

Even more scandalous, frontline health workers still aren’t being offered free testing for coronavirus, even as private companies sell tests for nearly £400 a pop. This means that many health and care workers who have symptoms, or who have come in to contact with someone who does, are being forced to self-isolate, reducing the NHS’ capacity even further. During pandemics like this, it’s not just the virus that kills people – the lack of capacity within the health system means that many more people will go without treatment for other conditions is dangerous as well.",,
Why Boris Johnson's 'Rooseveltian' Plan to Rescue the Economy Is a Lie,"A lot of the British press were impressed by Boris Johnson’s speech in Dudley on Tuesday, where the Prime Minister announced £5 billion in funding for investment projects for schools, hospitals, high streets, roads, rail, “and much more”.

“Boris Johnson plans a ‘Rooseveltian New Deal’ to rebuild Britain” ran a Telegraph headline that day. The Times shouted about a new “‘spending spree to boost Britain’s recovery from coronavirus”. “HEY BIG SPENDER” said the Sun, “Boris Johnson unveils bumper £5 billion ‘new deal’ recovery plan”.

Johnson has spent years telling the British public he’s a lot like Winston Churchill, and has moved onto raiding the legacy of his wartime counterpart Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), whose New Deal built the Hoover Dam, reformed the banks, and employed millions of Americans during the Great Depression. But the headline boast of the UK’s new deal – fixing a bridge in Sandwell and building a bunch of new prison cells – are hardly on the same scale.

Nearly everyone, Johnson included, knows a genuine recovery plan is needed if we ever want to get the economy back near where it set off pre-COVID. “This has been a disaster, let’s not mince our words,” said the Prime Minister in an interview with the Times’ radio station on Monday, a day before the highly billed speech. “I mean, this has been an absolute nightmare for the country. The country has gone through a profound shock.”

Right now, GDP is in freefall. Having dropped off a cliff in March, no one knows how far it has left to go. The latest stats available from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show the biggest month fall ever recorded, in April – ten times bigger than any fall ever recorded before COVID struck. “In April the economy was around 25 per cent smaller than in February,” summarised Jonathan Athow, ONS’ Deputy National Statistician for Economic Statistics. May and June’s stats, expected to show further falls, are yet to come.

But even a quick look at the content of Tuesday’s deal shows that it is nothing like a recovery package, let alone a New Deal. It’s difficult for many of us who haven’t seen a solid pay cheque since February to imagine just how minuscule this £5 billion is in terms of the economy. But it’s worth a try.

Johnson’s new deal is less than his manifesto promised he would spend on roof insulation. It is less than 0.3 per cent of GDP. Less than the National Audit Office says the backlog of school repairs will cost, alone. It’s eclipsed by the “green deal” announced by one Scottish electric company, SSE, a couple of weeks ago, and is not quite as much as TFL plans to spend adding four stations to the Underground. It is roughly the same amount as the government announced (to a lot of shrugs) for busses and bike lanes in February, as part of a speech that also greenlit the controversial £55 billion HS2 rail line.

When all is said and done, London will get £22.1 million from the Getting Building Fund, according to a letter sent this morning to Conservative MPs and seen by the BBC, which won’t build you a house in some parts of the capital.

Effectively, you're not going to build much of anything with £5 billion. And you’re not going to do much to create the fast, green recovery Johnson claimed, according to economists. “Funds that have been committed so far are way too low,” Carsten Jung, senior economist at IPPR's Centre for Economic Justice, tells me over the phone. “Now is a time for a step-change in the economy, we can build back better,” he adds. But this is not it.

In the absence of public investment, Johnson’s only indication of how he’d “level up” the UK, came in planning policy, where he announced Project Speed: these are “the most radical planning reforms since World War II” which will make it easier for private developers to convert empty buildings into homes without planning permission – and without having to build any affordable homes.

Deregulation and giveaways has always been this Tory party’s one big strategy on property development – even after 72 people were killed in the Grenfell Tower fire, demonstrating the dangers of previous attempts to loosen regulations, and after a 2014 attempt to create an empty property loophole was condemned as an “insane” giveaway to developers and stopped by the UK’s courts.

Already the government has shown similar instincts, strong-arming London’s transport network TFL to sell off its land to private buyers as part of the punitive bailout signed by Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.

Johnson made clear that pleasing the private sector is central to his plan. “The way to get UK business confident and growing is to give the private sector the confidence to invest, in capital, in skills and people, is to create the platform, and that’s what we’re going to do,” he told the Times on Monday.

If private companies were debt-free and thought customers were likely to be rushing back to spend, Johnson’s plan might have merits. But, world-leading economist Ann Pettifor tells me, “because the pandemic has caused so much uncertainty, the private sector will be reluctant to risk investment.""

Johnson’s attempts to catfish the British public with images of increasingly remote world leaders are running up against his lack of any real plans for how he might “build back better” in the wake of coronavirus.",,

The Race Chat: How White Parents Avoid Talking to Their Children About Racism,"My parents have talked openly about race and racism my entire life. Of course, like all Black parents, they'd rather they didn't have to – but here we are. Sometimes it's a lighthearted joke about food or music, or how Arsenal's downfall came when they stopped being a predominately Black team. But more often than not, it's serious, and in those cases – when they start the conversation with ""Please"" or call me up in a mild panic when I'm out late on a Saturday night because they were ""just watching the news and noticed a heavy police presence on the streets and they wanted to make sure that I knew what to do if I was stopped"" – the fear in their voice alone is enough to make you want to burn the system down, twice.

This ritual is tragically necessary , but patently absurd. Racism has nothing to do with the actions of the Black community. Parents shouldn't have to ask their kids to modulate their behaviour to accommodate a broken system. It’s clear this is a conversation that white parents should be having to ensure that their children understand their responsibility in actively fighting prejudice – which is why, when I found out recently that most white families have no formal discussion about race and racism, I struggled to understand.

""Please, don't forget you're Black,"" they told me when I was ten, leaving Lagos (the Blackest Place on Earth) to go to school in Bath (the Whitest Place on Earth). ""You won't be able to get away with what your new friends can get away with."" The most recent conversation came last weekend, when they heard Nazis were roaming around central London and called every five minutes on my cycle home from dropping some essentials over at my aunt's.

By now, you should be aware that the vast majority of Black parents have the ""The Talk"" – a sit-down conversation with their kids about how to avoid being killed by an act of racist violence, by the state or otherwise . However, a common misconception is that it's just one big discussion, when in reality it's a never-ending series of conversations about how to manoeuvre up and around potentially harmful situations – personal, professional, political – morphing over time to respond to the temperature of society.

To find out how this was possible, I reached out to ten white people I know to be socially liberal and supporters of the Black Lives Matter cause – a group I had previously assumed were most likely to have had these open conversations at home – about how their families discussed race growing up.

Almost all of them admitted they had never had a formal conversation with their parents growing up, even when many wanted to. And almost all of them were left to navigate the intricacies of racism either on their own or by relying on Black classmates or neighbours to explain the challenges they faced.

'MAYBE THEY THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT TRYING TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED AS RACISM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW'

""My parents didn't sit down for The Chat with me. I don't know if they felt like they didn't have to – since we grew up in a very racially diverse part of east London and lots of my school friends and youth team mates were Black – or they didn't want to. In private there would still be the odd off-colour joke, but I was taught the don't-be-a-cunt-to-people rule in principle. It was always made to sound self-preservative rather than actively kind; the ways you can make sure you don’t cause yourself trouble: be smart, watch how you treat others, show respect to those around you.

""Where they live now is one of the most Brexit boroughs in the country. There's a level of ignorance prevalent there that manifests as aggression when challenged, and my parents seeing that aggression firsthand in London as kids – in the National Front and racists in respective pubs their parents ran – has had a massive effect on my parents' personalities. They just want a peaceful life, and the easiest way to achieve that is to just keep your mouth shut. So I wasn’t raised to consider the external factors which saw my friends' older brothers being led out of our block of flats by police in the middle of the night. My parents moved away from politics as though they didn't understand it. Too smart for the reactive dog-whistle racism of the far-right and alienated by the perceived intellectualism of the left. Maybe they thought twice about trying to explain something as complicated as racism to me because they didn't know how, didn't want to say the wrong thing.

""As I've grown older and more conscious of issues of race and injustice, I’ve felt more comfortable interrogating them on their feelings. While cautious, they are broadly tolerant and accepting. But they acknowledge society's fundamental problems without seeing how they can affect change – 'It's always been this way.'""

– Will, 27

'THE ONLY TIME I WOULD EVER TALK ABOUT RACE WITH MY PARENTS WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF ME EXPLAINING WHY THEY CAN'T SAY CERTAIN THINGS'

""I grew up in the predominantly white outer suburbs of Leeds (there were two Black guys in my year at school). The only time I would ever talk about race with my parents was in the context of me explaining why they can't say certain things. Dad always referred to Black men as ""cool"". My mum’s best mate's daughter Molly has a Ghanaian boyfriend, and mum will always prefix a story about him with ""Molly's Ghanaian boyfriend"" with a slightly winking tone, as if what country he's from makes him cheeky or something. Other times, they might mention a person’s Blackness only in the context of something bad happening.

""I’ve moved back home due to the coronavirus pandemic, and since the Black Lives Matter protests my parents and I have started to talk about race in a way that goes beyond me wincing at them. Dad wasn’t sure about the statues coming down. 'Why couldn’t they just put up a plaque next to Colston explaining that he was evil?' he asked. So I told him what I’d heard others say: that black people shouldn’t have to walk around their city looking up at the faces of men who enslaved their ancestors. That it's so perfect that a man who transported people across the sea in chains for a life of misery and cruelty should fall in that very same water.",,
Justin Trudeau Defends Canada's Opioid Response as Death Toll Nears Record,"This year could be the deadliest on record in the drug poisoning epidemic that has slammed Canada, compounding and worsening the problems of COVID-19.

But while Ottawa spends billions to develop treatments and vaccines to crush the coronavirus, a new report from the Public Health Agency of Canada says things may only worsen for drug users, if immediate action isn’t taken.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continued to laud his government’s action to combat the crisis, insisting he has taken “strong action to fight the opioid epidemic,” in response to a question from VICE News on Friday.

Trudeau rattled off action his government has taken, including expanding access to safe consumption sites, making overdose-reversing drug naloxone more readily available, and providing prescription drug alternatives to users.

Yet access to services remains spotty across the country. There are no supervised consumption sites in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and sites tend to be grouped around major cities. There are open questions as to whether the measures taken to fight the opioid crisis will be effective against burgeoning methamphetamine abuse.

But his own public health agency confirms that things are worsening, not getting better. On Thursday, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, released her annual report, which focused on some of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Simulations run by the public health agency report that increased prices, increased or unstable levels of fentanyl in the drug supply, a lack of support services, and isolation caused by the COVID-19 will likely mean the “opioid overdose deaths may increase in 2020 beyond the levels seen at the peak of the opioid crisis in 2018.”

The data suggests it’s already the case. Over 1,200 people have died in British Columbia in the first nine months of this year, worse than the 2018 peek. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario are all reporting significant spikes in overdose and poisoning deaths.

Reporting standards on overdose deaths are inconsistent across the country, but VICE News found at least 2,898 Canadians died of overdose or poisonings in the first nine months of the year.

On Wednesday, Tam told CBC’s Power & Politics that overdose prevention sites and harm reduction measures were necessary, but suggested they just weren’t enough.

“I do feel that we have to have good debate, discussion, about the decriminalization of simple possession of drugs, because we can’t arrest our way out of that crisis, and so it is time,” she said, acknowledging that many of her local colleagues have endorsed the call to decriminalize.

When VICE News asked health officers across the country their views, six, in addition to Tam, called for some form of decriminalization or legalization. “This is a good opportunity to address that as a society,” Tam said.

Pressed on the fact that his senior most health advisor is pushing him on decriminalization, and that the actions his government has taken have not reduced the overdose trend, Trudeau reverted to the same talking points he has used for years.

“We know that there is no one solution to stopping the opioid epidemic,” he said. Trudeau insisted that “we are looking at a broad range of actions,” but specified none.

“We will still continue to listen to the best advice of experts and public health officials as we look for other steps we can take as we continue to fight that epidemic,” Trudeau added.

To date, decriminalization has been endorsed by the chief public health officers of Canada, British Columbia, Vancouver, Toronto, Quebec, Montreal; the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police; B.C. Premier John Horgan; Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart; the New Democratic Party; the members of the Liberal Party of Canada; Liberal Members of Parliament Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and Hedy Fry.",,
'There Is No Turning Back' – Polish Women Undeterred by Threat of Far-Right Violence,"People take part in a demonstration against the abortion ban in Warsaw, Poland. Photo: Piotr Lapinski/NurPhoto via Getty Images

Polish women’s rights groups were bracing for a violent response from far-right ultranationalists on Friday, as they prepared for the largest pro-choice demonstrations yet against a controversial court ruling severely restricting abortions.

Poland has faced a wave of angry protests since an October 22 court ruling found that abortion in the case of severe foetal defects was unconstitutional, removing the most common of the few existing grounds for legal termination in the predominantly Catholic country.

Those demonstrations, some of which have targeted Catholic churches, have been met with a brutal response by ultranationalist groups, many of whose members are drawn from the violent football hooligan scene. During nationwide protests on Wednesday, members of the ultranationalist All-Polish Youth attacked women demonstrating in Wroclaw, Poznan, and Bialystok.

As the All-Polish Youth announced plans for further counter-demonstrations in the city of Lublin Friday, the leader of another far-right group issued a call on social media for supporters to mobilise against a huge pro-choice protest planned in Warsaw.

“The aggressive left is making an invasion of the capital,” said Robert Bąkiewicz, the leader of a group whose members roughed up women protesting at a Warsaw church on Sunday.

“Churches and monuments are likely to be destroyed again. They cannot be allowed to do so, so I am asking for mobilisation,” he added.

Rights groups told VICE News they feared further violence from the far-right Friday, as ultranationalists grew increasingly emboldened by encouragement from governing politicians, and the failure of police to rein them in.

“There are concerns of further attacks by nationalist groups on protesters tonight,” said Draginja Nadazdin, director of Amnesty Poland. “The police must facilitate those wishing to protest peacefully in support of women, including by safeguarding protesters against harassment and violent attacks by counter-demonstrators.”

Agata Maciejewska, spokesperson for Polish feminist organization Dziewuchy Dziewuchom (“Girls for Girls”), told VICE News that she expected trouble from the far-right.

“It is clear that they can feel stronger today than ever, with a sense of impunity to vent their aggression,” she said. “All we can do is stay in a tight formation, take care of each other and call for help in any case of provocation.”

Like many people in Poland, including the head of the opposition, Maciejewska blamed the country’s most powerful politician, Jarosław Kaczyński, for inciting the far-right violence against protesters.

On Tuesday, in the wake of the clashes at churches, Kaczyński released a widely-viewed video message denouncing the protests as anti-religious ""nihilism” and calling on supporters to rally behind the church.

""We must defend Polish churches, we must defend them at every price,"" said Kaczyński, the leader of the ruling conservative Law and Justice party.

The remarks drew a furious response from the leader of the opposition Civic Coalition party, Borys Budka, who said Kaczyński had stoked hatred and sown division; the following day, women protesters were attacked by far-right groups in three cities.

Maciejewska called Kaczyński’s remarks “scandalous” and a “call for civil war”.

“There is no doubt that President Kaczyński’s speech was an invitation to attack the protesters,” she said. “The president gave his consent to attack demonstrations, which triggered not only nationalists, but all kinds of fighters.”

Rafał Pankowski, an associate professor at Warsaw university Collegium Civitas and an expert on the Polish far-right, said he was concerned about the growing threat of further violence, as fascist groups announced the formation of new street-level units to “defend” churches amid the abortion debate.

“They are ostensibly formed to ‘defend the faith,’ but it's apparent they wish to dominate the streets and intimidate opponents,” he told VICE News.

“Importantly, they have drawn support from the ranks of far-right football hooligans who physically attacked protesters in many places across Poland in recent days.”

He said the controversy over the abortion issue had only exacerbated the widening divide between liberal and conservative Poles under the ruling nationalist Law and Justice party, intensifying a culture war that had already been waged over immigration and LGBTQ rights.

“The social polarisation in Poland has reached a critical point, and the far-right groups feel emboldened as self-proclaimed defenders of Catholic identity,” he said. “They appear to be… fired up.”

Friday’s march in Warsaw is being held in defiance of a ban on public gatherings amid a surge in the spread of coronavirus, which hit a record of more than 20,000 new cases and 301 deaths Thursday. Prosecutors have threatened criminal charges against protest organisers for creating an “epidemiological threat.”

But women’s groups counter that they had warned the government that there would be a massive backlash if the court pushed through the ruling. Those planning to take to the streets say they are undeterred by the threat of charges or far-right violence.",,
Argentina Just Bulldozed a Camp Filled With Families Made Homeless by COVID,"Shacks burn during a land eviction on October 29, 2020 in Guernica, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Police removed thousands of people who have been living here since July and say they were made homeless by COVID. Photo by Tomás Cuesta, Getty Images.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina - Ana Malitti was chatting and listening to music late at night with her family when they realized the eviction was upon them. The lights in their makeshift home flickered off. A police officer that was usually stationed nearby left. The lights returned momentarily and then everything went dark at 4 a.m. By 5 a.m., the police started to arrive.

“They didn’t give you time for anything,” said Malitti, aged aged 40. “People were running, screaming, [there were] sticks, rocks, tear gas.”

Malitti and her neighbours were forcibly evicted from a land occupation at an empty lot in Buenos Aires in the early morning of October 29. The move came after last-ditch attempts to negotiate a peaceful solution with the local government ground to a halt.

Around 4,000 officers cleared the site in Guernica, Buenos Aires Province, at the crack of dawn. Bulldozers and tractors crushed some of the makeshift huts that the families were living in, while others were set on fire.

The occupants, including families with young children, had been living on the land since July. Many had lost their homes and jobs because of the COVID pandemic. A census carried out the previous week found that 4,417 people were living at the occupation.

Sergio Berni, Minister of Security for Buenos Aires Province, said: “Usurping [land] is a crime, and so while I’m minister, the right to life, the right to freedom, and the right to private property is an obligation that we have to guarantee with our security forces.”

Malitti is paid by the hour as a house cleaner. Her husband works as a gardener. When the pandemic struck, the work dried up and they couldn’t pay their rent. They hoped their lot at the occupation would become a permanent home.

They had built a structure out of tarp and corrugated metal, with a small bathroom. “We were comfortable,” she said on Thursday, as she looked over at what was left of her dwelling, police officers blocking the way back into the squat.

Riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets against residents who didn’t want to leave. They defended themselves with improvised shields and stones. Around 35 people were arrested, according to local media.

When the occupation started in July, private owners including construction company El Bellaco started legal proceedings to kick the families off the land. El Bellaco is planning to build an exclusive gated community on part of the site.

A team of architects and lawyers supporting the occupation argued that there was enough space to build both the gated community and permanent housing for those at the occupation. They added that those who said they owned the rest of the land had dubious claims to it, and in practice, it was an abandoned wasteland that the government could legally take over and turn into social housing for the inhabitants. But their argument was rejected by the local court.

The Buenos Aires Province government has said that “transition centers” will be provided for families from the occupation who have nowhere else to go.

On Tuesday, Buenos Aires Province governor Axel Kiciloff created a monthly cash benefit of up to ARS50,000 ($639) for six months for families left destitute by the pandemic. But those living at the occupation saw the offer as a short-term solution to a long-term problem.",,
Trump's ‘Stealth Deportations’ of Venezuelans May Violate Human Rights,"A man from Venezuela seeking asylum in the United States holds his daughter at the entrance to the Paso del Norte International Bridge on February 28, 2020, in Ciudad Juárez. Photo by PAUL RATJE, AFP via Getty Images

Several Caribbean island nations and the United States have come under fire from humanitarian groups and U.S. politicians for deporting Venezuelan migrants and refugees home amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The government of U.S. President Donald Trump deported hundreds of Venezuelans through Caribbean island Trinidad and Tobago this year, according to human rights groups, who estimate some 258 people have been sent back in recent months.

The stealth deportations - as they have been dubbed by advocates - could violate U.S. and international laws and policies, politicians and human rights groups say.

U.S. Senator Bob Menendez is calling on Trump’s administration to provide details of the previously undisclosed deportations through the Caribbean nation, with specifics on how many Venezuelans were shipped back back to a country where many fled political persecution, hunger and insecurity.

Venezuela has been severely economically crippled since 2015, and nearly 5.5 million migrants and refugees have since left, says the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). There is ample evidence of unlawful executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture in Venezuela in recent years.

Elliott Abrams, the U.S. State Department’s Special Representative for Venezuela, acknowledged in February that some deportations of Venezuelans were continuing. But in August, he said that it was not safe to return Venezuelans to their country of origin and said that the administration was not currently deporting them.

But evidence suggests otherwise. In the most recent case, 93 Venezuelans were reportedly sent back to their country on September 18 from Trinidad and Tobago. That prompted over 20 humanitarian and human rights organizations to call on the island nation to protect Venezuelan migrant rights and to break ties with the Trump administration in the deportations.

“As your government may be aware, most people who return or are deported to Venezuela are placed in quarantine centres, many of which are under the control of the police and the military,” a joint letter to Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister, Keith Rowley said. “These entities have been involved in a policy of repression since at least 2014, and as the UN has indicated in its findings, some of their leaders may be responsible for crimes against humanity.”

Human Rights Watch told VICE News that sending back asylum seekers “openly violates the principle of non-refoulement”, one of the most basic protections for refugees in international law.

“Deporting Venezuelans back to a country where the government is brutally cracking down on opponents and with a humanitarian emergency that predates the COVID pandemic puts the lives and health of deportees at risk,” Tamara Taraciuk Broner, deputy director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, said.

VICE News requested comment from Trinidad and Tobago’s Ministry of National Security but did not receive a response.

Other Caribbean nations have also come under scrutiny. The Dutch islands of Aruba and Curaçao have also deported Venezuelan migrants back home.

“It is imperative that the government of Trinidad and Tobago and other countries in the region ensure Venezuelans have access to legal status to afford them protection in a land to where they fled precisely to end the abuses they were suffering at home,” Taracuik said.

The United States has placed sanctions on Venezuela - which is governed by socialist President Nicolás Maduro - including the suspension of direct flights between the two countries in recent years.

“It is shocking that the Trump administration pursued these deportations after a May 2019 Department of Transportation suspension of air service between U.S. and Venezuelan airports, due to the economic and political crisis in Venezuela,” said Aviva Shwayder, a spokesperson for humanitarian non-profit, Refugees International, in a statement.

U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden used the news as an opportunity to blast Trump on Twitter, saying Venezuelans should have been granted temporary protected status to block their removal.

“It’s abundantly clear he has no regard for the suffering of the Venezuelan people,” he said in October.

Some Caribbean island countries have used the coronavirus pandemic to justify turning away migrants and refugees, to the dismay of humanitarian organizations.",,
Genocide Survivors Say Guatemalan Government is Blocking Their Fight for Justice,"A Ixil indigenous woman, and survivor of Guatemala's civil war, attends the trial against retired Guatemalan dictator General Jose Efrain Rios Montt in Guatemala City on May 9, 2013.

GUATEMALA CITY – Jesús Tecú Osorio was ten years old when a paramilitary patrolman grabbed his two-year-old brother from his arms and killed him.

It was the early 1980s, the height of the atrocities of Guatemala’s 36-year civil war between leftist guerrillas and the government. Tecú Osorio’s brother, parents, and nearly everyone else from the indigenous Maya Achí village of Río Negro, 70 miles north of the capital, were among the estimated 200,000 victims, most of them civilians.

“We still carry that pain in the depths of our hearts,” said Tecú Osorio.

For decades, Tecú Osorio and other survivors have been engaged in an uphill battle for truth and justice. Now they also have to contend with the closure of official peace institutions originally created to provide justice to victims - a development survivors claim is a government ploy to back out of legal commitments enshrined in the peace accords that ended the 1960-1996 civil war.

“This is the coup de grâce for the peace accords,” said Miguel Itzep, president of an indigenous-led national victims movement called Q’anil Tinamit.

Itzep, Tecú Osorio and countless other genocide survivors have dedicated their lives to fighting impunity and ensuring the past is never repeated. The shutdown of peace bodies is seen by families of victims as a slap in the face.

“It concerns us and at the same time it fills us with anger,” Tecú Osorio told VICE News. “What they seek is impunity, and for everything that happened to be forgotten.”

In his 20s, Tecú Osorio was instrumental in one of the country’s first convictions for crimes against humanity. Former members of paramilitary militias known as “Civil Defense Patrols” that were set up by and often worked side by side with the military - known as PACs - were sentenced to decades and even centuries in prison for massacres, including the one that killed Tecú Osorio’s brother and 176 other children and women.

Now he is supporting 36 indigenous Maya Achí women in their court cases against other ex-paramilitary patrolmen in which the women claim rape was used against them as a weapon of war. The women are represented by the law firm Tecú Osorio founded in 1999, the same year a report from a United Nations-backed truth commission concluded state actors carried out acts of genocide.

But with progress came backlash.

“Every time we seek justice and want to clarify the truth in the courts, they say it’s revenge, that it’s no longer necessary to remember the past, or that it doesn’t lead to anything good for the country,” said Tecú Osorio.

The struggle for justice for survivors of Guatemala’s genocide has often been a case of two steps forward, one step back. Currently in limbo, a proposed amnesty bill that would let perpetrators walk free still casts a shadow over ongoing and pending trials for genocide, forced disappearances, and other crimes against humanity.

Then this year, Guatemala President Alejandro Giammattei presented decrees shutting down three institutions designed to fulfill governmental responsibilities stemming from the peace process. The Secretariat of Peace, Secretariat of Agrarian Affairs, and the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Executive Branch Human Rights Policy are all now defunct.

A new Presidential Peace and Human Rights Commission, COPADEH, is to replace the three abolished bodies.

The new commission is part of a restructuring that arose from a push for efficiency, according to presidential press secretary Francis Masek. The government’s fulfilment of commitments derived from the peace accords remains among COPADEH’s main objectives, she said.

“Democratic institutions are not being dismantled,” Masek told VICE News in a written statement.

The former head of the peace secretariat was sworn in last week as executive director of COPADEH. The new commission is still in the process of being set up, though, and survivors and human rights groups have doubts the body will help them at all.

“We are left in a country with no commitments to peace and with no commitments to human rights,” said Feliciana Macario from CONAVIGUA, a human rights organization founded by women whose husbands and other relatives were killed or disappeared during the civil war.

Survivors around the country who would usually take to the streets to protest these kinds of developments are being held back by COVID-19 restrictions, said Macario.

“They’re taking advantage of the situation, while we are all shut inside.”

Still, Macario and other representatives of victim groups gathered in Guatemala City earlier this month to call on the Constitutional Court to rule on their legal challenges and suspend the closure of the three peace institutions.

The institutions were frequently underfunded and the National Reparations Program that fell under the peace secretariat sometimes had no budget at all. Survivors are concerned the intention behind the restructuring is not efficiency but to abandon commitments to justice altogether.

The government will transfer the reparations program to the Ministry of Social Development, for example, a move Macario says contravenes the program’s spirit and purpose. She’s also concerned about the program’s files detailing the sensitive accounts of thousands of victims of wartime human rights violations.

“They are very important documents that contain the testimonies of victims,” said Macario. “What is going to happen with the victims? With the files?”

Macario and other victim group representatives emphasized that the government’s actions this year did not come out of nowhere. Successive administrations have been consistently undermining Guatemala’s peace process, especially over the last eight years, they said.

“It is part of a strategy,” Itzep told VICE News.

This month’s rally in the capital was intentionally small as the pandemic continues. But Itzep says that people need their concerns heard beyond paper statements, and that survivor associations around the country are going to begin with local and regional actions.",,
Quebec Sword Attack Suspect Spoke of Similar Crime Five Years Ago: Police,"Police officers detain a suspect near the National Assembly of Quebec, in Quebec City, early on November 1, 2020, after two people were killed and five wounded by a sword-wielding suspect dressed in medieval clothing.

Two people are dead and five injured after a man dressed in a medieval costume walked around Quebec City Saturday night—on Halloween—sabre in hand, “with the intention of doing the most damage possible,” police say.

The incident took place about five years after the suspect, now in custody, was “in a medical context” and allegedly said he had plans to carry out a similar attack, Quebec City Police Chief Robert Pigeon told reporters on Sunday.

Police were first called to the scene around 10:30 p.m. local time on Saturday, after the suspect stopped a running car at the historic Chateau Frontenac hotel, one of Quebec City’s most famous landmarks. Gas cans and a sword holster were later found inside the vehicle.

Three women found one victim lying on the ground near the hotel as the suspect made his way through the historic quarter of the city and allegedly attacked more people, Quebec newspaper Le Soleil reported. Police officers later discovered more victims in at least three other places.

According to the Montreal Gazette, witness Ariane Genest decided to have a cigarette outside of her home a few hundred metres away from the Chateau Frontenac, on Parloir St. She recalled how police were running through the streets, screaming at people to stay indoors.

“I was freaking out,” Genest told the Gazette.

Genest told the newspaper she sprinted back indoors, locked her apartment, grabbed a knife, and waited in fear as police continued their search for the suspect.

“It’s like surreal, to think that it’s happening here, in Quebec,” Genest said.

After 2.5 hours of searching and the deployment of several officers, patrol cars, two tactical units, and canine squads, police found the suspect at the city’s waterfront, about a kilometre from the old port, shortly before 1 a.m. He was lying on the ground, barefoot, and hypothermic, and didn’t resist arrest, reported Le Soleil.

Carl Girouard, of Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder on Sunday afternoon after appearing in court via video conference.

Pigeon told reporters early Sunday the attacks, while premeditated, were random.

There are no signs of terrorism, ethnic or religious extremism at this time, Pigeon said.

Pigeon said the suspect was first taken to hospital for evaluation, but didn’t offer additional information about the suspect’s condition. Girouard didn’t have a criminal record.

Police confirmed the two victims killed were 56-year-old François Duchesne and 61-year-old Suzanne Clermont, both Quebec City residents.

Clermont was a hairdresser at Salon Les Z'ongles and Duchesne was the director of communications for the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, CBC News reported.

The attack that killed Clermont allegedly took place just outside her front door; she often stepped out to smoke before going to sleep, reported the CBC.

Duchesne died near the Chateau Frontenac while out for a run, according to the public broadcaster.

“The cultural community is shaken to learn of the death of François Duchesne,” tweeted Quebec’s Minister of Culture, Nathalie Roy.

Police are now investigating 25 potential crime scenes, including Girouard’s residence and spots in Quebec City that were spattered with blood on Saturday night. Pigeon said he doesn’t foresee anymore deaths, even though the five injured victims sustained significant lacerations.

All seven of the victims had been living in Quebec City and two are French nationals.

The identities of the living victims are covered under a publication ban, CBC reported.

The attack has renewed calls for better mental health support and funding.

“Mental health issues are the biggest safety concerns in major Canadian cities for decades to come,” said Quebec City’s Mayor Régis Labeaume, who is calling for a National Assembly debate on mental health.

Lionel Carmant, Quebec’s junior health and social services minister, will make an announcement about mental health at 1 p.m. on Monday, CTV reported.

Psychologist Christine Grou told the Gazette that a number of factors can influence how someone lives through and reacts to extreme mental health struggles, including past and untreated trauma, social exclusion, poverty, and triggering events like breakups—or the ongoing pandemic.

Mathieu Dufour, a forensic psychiatrist and associate chief of the department of psychiatry at l'Institut national de psychiatrie légale Philippe-Pinel, told the newspaper, “Most people with mental illnesses are not violent and they are much more often victims of crime than perpetrators.”",,
Migrants at the Mexico Border Aren't Counting on a Biden Win to Change Their Fate,"That is exactly what she wants to do. But not here. She wants to get her family across the dark, ugly, rusty metal border wall that slices between Tijuana and San Diego, and separates the tens of thousands of migrants waiting listlessly in Mexican border cities from their ultimate, American, dream.

TIJUANA, Mexico - Elida Jiménez, a 36-year-old mother of two small children from Guatemala, has been living in the Agape migrant shelter in the border city of Tijuana, Mexico for months.

The U.S / Mexico border has been effectively shut to non-essential, non-American travel since March, when the COVID pandemic hit. The American asylum system, which had already closed its doors to most migrants, ground to a halt. Tens of thousands of migrants are awaiting interviews and court appearances that keep getting pushed back.

The reality on the ground here at the border reflects an enduring paradox that has propelled hundreds of thousands of people from Central America as well as nations in Asia and Africa to attempt to cross the U.S / Mexico border in recent years. In fiscal year 2018, Customs and Border Protection registered just under 400,000 apprehensions . In 2019, that number was over 850,000.

“God is the media we listen to. He will decide where we end up,” said Jiménez in a low, soft voice.

The next president of the United States will likely determine the fate of thousands of asylum seekers here on the U.S-Mexico border. Already, immigrant-rights advocates are gearing up to lobby a Democratic administration to repeal some of President Donald Trump’s most draconian policies. But migrants here are not anxiously following the election, unlike so many Americans, who will be glued to their screens and phones in the coming days to learn whether Vice President Joe Biden or Trump will be the next president.

Cindy Piñeda, from Honduras, told VICE News that she started her asylum application in the U.S. 15 months ago, and has been waiting here in Tijuana ever since. Alejandro Cossio for VICE News.

Cindy Piñeda, from Honduras, was staying in the same refuge as Jiménez, crowded into a small room stuffed with clothes-covered bunk beds piled high with scruffy soft toys. Four families were living there, all with small children who ran around screaming and playing as she talked to VICE News. She said she started her asylum process in the United States 15 months ago and has been waiting here ever since.

But when that will be, nobody knows, no matter the outcome of the election.

Fertus was studying medicine before he left Haiti and wants to do the same in the United States, after he gets asylum and then learns English. He seemed undaunted by the challenge ahead: “We want to go to the U.S – there is no life here in Mexico.” He just needs to find a job that earns him enough to keep them all alive until the border and asylum system opens up.

Across town, Francky Fertus, aged 31, his wife Maudit, 21 and their two-month-old baby Bryan were sharing a tiny apartment with fellow Haitian Venante Venet and her six-month old baby girl, Gloria. Both babies were born in Tijuana. The families have been here for the best part of a year. The dingy apartment they share is stiflingly hot, and water drips from the improvised sink / stove installed on one wall.

“I don’t think there’s a very real sophisticated awareness of what is going on,” said Father Pat Murphy, an American who runs the Casa de Migrante shelter, currently home to some 60 migrants, a third of which are young children. “They’re not watching PBS. They just want to know when they can apply for asylum.”

In Tijuana, migrants asked what they thought of either Republican Donald Trump or Democrat and former Vice President Joe Biden for president mostly just shrugged their shoulders or looked blank.

Francky and Maudit are from Haiti, and have been waiting in Tijuana for months for the U.S. asylum system to open up. Their two-month-old baby Bryan was born in Tijuana. Alejandro Cossio for VICE News.

The COVID-19 pandemic offered Trump the justification he has long sought to suspend asylum hearings at the border. Anyone caught trying to enter the U.S. illegally is automatically expelled within a matter of hours.

If President Trump wins, it is virtually guaranteed he will continue his assault on the U.S.’ legal immigration system and efforts to close the southern border to asylum seekers. In recent weeks, he has sought to energize his campaign by returning to his go-to theme that migrants will steal jobs from Americans.

But the promise of a Democratic president doesn’t represent salvation to the migrants waiting on the border.

“The truth is that for so many years, the Democrats have promised change for migrants. But they’ve never delivered,” Pastor Alberto Rivera, aged 58, who runs the Agape migrant mission, told VICE News. “Not [Bill] Clinton, and not [Barack] Obama – instead of helping, Obama deported more migrants than ever!”

Some observers question whether Biden would be able to afford to take a starkly different approach to Trump. As the pandemic continues to batter the United States, Biden could say that the justifications for detain and return policies on the border remain. And as countries further south in the region start to reopen after lockdown, experts are predicting that a new surge in migration could coincide with Biden taking power, should he win.

“I suspect that a Biden administration will still use law enforcement as a tool for addressing migration. They're not going to just throw the borders open and say ‘come on in folks, the Trump era is over.' That's going to be one of their biggest challenges,” said Eric Olson, the director of policy at the Seattle International Foundation think tank.",,
"Indonesian Protesters Burn Pictures of France's Macron, Call Him the Devil","A Muslim protester burns a poster of French President Emmanuel Macron outside the French Institute in Bandung on Nov. 2, 2020. Photo: Timur Matahari / AFP

A few thousand protesters in the world's most populous Muslim nation Indonesia denounced the French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday after he defended the publication of cartoons showing the Prophet Muhammad.

Gathering outside the French embassy in the capital Jakarta, the protesters burned images of Macron, chanted slogans and held up signs saying ""Go to Hell Macron,"" ""Macron is the real terrorist,"" and ""Macron is Devil."" The embassy was heavily guarded but the demonstration dispersed peacefully in the afternoon.

Macron has faced condemnation and calls for boycotts of French goods from across the Muslim world in recent days even as France mourns the death of at least four people killed over the cartoons, which were initially published in the Charlie Hebdo magazine five years ago and were discussed in a classroom during a lecture in Paris on freedom of expression last month.

The teacher who led the class was beheaded on Oct. 16 and three people were stabbed to death in a separate incident at a church in the seaside town of Nice last week. The violence was a macabre parallel with the assault on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in 2015 when Islamist attackers stormed its office and killed 12 people. The magazine republished the cartoons in September to mark the start of the trial for suspected accomplices.

Macron has called Islam a religion in crisis and in an interview with Al-Jazeera over the weekend he defended the right to freedom of expression but said he understood that people could be ""shocked by the caricatures.""

But the speakers at the protest, who wore masks because of the pandemic, were not persuaded.

""We demand an apology from him! We demand the Indonesian government to expel the French ambassador!” said one Muslim cleric. Crowds replied ""Allahu Akbar!"" which is Arabic for ""God is Great.""

One of the protesters, Ela Sapari, told VICE News that it is forbidden to draw the prophet in Islam and that the images are ""hurting Muslims.""

""It is our obligation to defend the Prophet Muhammad,"" she said, while holding a poster that depicted Macron as an enemy of Islam. Several who attended said they would stop using French products.

""I will have to throw away my collection of Hermes and Dior bags. Today I brought my Fendi since it's Italian,"" Sapari said.

Others said they would stop drinking the Aqua brand of mineral water and cease using the cosmetics brand L'Oreal.

""All Muslims in the world must be united to fight against Macron and France,"" Hana, a woman in her 50s, told VICE News.",,
WATCH: Videos from Inside the Illegal Halloween Rave in Bristol,"Police have claimed they were attacked while breaking up an illegal rave in Yate, a town 12 miles north of Bristol.

Officers were called to the site at 10.30PM on Saturday night. Upon their arrival, according to Avon and Somerset Police, they were pelted with objects by some members of the crowd.

A police spokesman said: “Some people became hostile towards the police. Items, including lit spray cans and bottles, were thrown at police, some of whom were injured but remained on duty.”

After police cut the mains power to the building where the party was being held, the ravers continued to play music from an alternative source. By Sunday, the police succeeded in clearing out the site (which was extensively damaged), seized a bunch of sound equipment and arrested eight people, including one man thought to be the organiser.

Chief Insp Mark Runacres claimed it was a ""challenging operation"" with a ""large number of people in a confined space and several officers being assaulted"".

The event was in direct breach of new coronavirus-related legislation, introduced this August, which can result in anyone who organises an illegal rave being fined up to £10,000. Anyone who attends an illegal party, meanwhile, can be fined £100.

Despite the condemnation the event was met with on social media, many of the people who went have no regrets. A trio of attendees told the BBC: “It was absolutely amazing – one night of the year where we can all come together.”",,

"Support New Work By David Fussell, from Our 'Homeless Film Director' Documentary","In 2019, VICE released The Homeless Film Director, which followed the story of filmmaker David Fussell as he tried to make his film Mystic Demon Killer while homeless. Our documentary followed Fussell as approached the cinema premiere of the movie, after spending four-and-a-half years working on it.

Also a keen photographer outside of filmmaking, Fussell regularly contributes imagery to the annual MyWorld calendar, curated by Cafe Art – a social enterprise by and for people affected by homelessness – and sells the calendars in person on markets and at train stations.

As with many other face-to-face activities, this year, the COVID-19 pandemic will prevent these in-person sales, which are crucial to the project’s success.

So, instead, Cafe Art is producing the calendar (as well as cards and printed photographs) on a pre-sale basis in order to best serve their contributors and vendors. As well as David’s photo – seen above – the 2021 calendar contains images submitted by people affected by homelessness in cities like Budapest, New Orleans, São Paolo, Sydney and Toronto.",,

China Lashes Out at Australia for Revoking Visas of Prominent Chinese Scholars,"The Chinese Government has accused Australian authorities of “hypocrisy” for secretly raiding the homes of four Chinese journalists in Australia in late June.

Multiple state media organisations published articles overnight claiming that Australia ""severely infringed on the legitimate rights of Chinese journalists"" and committed ""hypocrisy in upholding so-called 'freedom of the press'"", according to the ABC.

The state media reports came just a day after Australia’s last two accredited journalists in China were forced to flee the country—leaving Australia without any correspondents there for the first time in 40 years—as a result of intimidation from Chinese authorities.

China News Service was among the outlets that published details of the alleged raids in Australia, reporting overnight that ""At dawn of June 26 this year, Australian law enforcement officers conducted an unprovoked search on the residences of four journalists from three Chinese media organisations in Australia on the grounds of alleged violations of Australia's Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act.”

""Items such as mobile phones, computers and writing materials were seized,” the report stated. ""In the end, the Australian investigation results proved that the Chinese journalists did not engage in activities incompatible with their identities.""

The ABC confirmed today that senior Chinese media officials in Australia had been targeted and the visas of two leading Chinese scholars revoked as part of an unprecedented foreign interference investigation into a New South Wales political staffer. These moves followed allegations that the Chinese Communist Party plotted to infiltrate Parliament through the office of Labor backbencher Shaoquett Moselmane, using his former staffer John Zhang.

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is investigating whether Zhang—who stridently denies the allegations and is challenging the investigation in the High Court—used a chat group on the popular Chinese social media platform WeChat to encourage Moselmane to advocate for the Chinese Government's interests.

Senior Chinese media officials in Australia have also been targeted by the investigation, including the Australia bureau chief of China News Service, Tao Shelan; China Radio International's Sydney bureau chief Li Dayong; and prominent Chinese scholar and media commentator Professor Chen Hong.

Allegations state that they were all members of the same WeChat group, and the AFP has suggested that they, along with Zhang, ""concealed or failed to disclose to Mr Moselmane that they were acting on behalf of or in collaboration with Chinese State and Party apparatus"", according to documents filed by Zhang in the High Court.

News of that investigation has been public since late June, when Australia’s Foreign Interference Task Force raided the NSW Parliament and searched the homes and offices of Moselmane and Zhang. But Chinese state media only published their reports about alleged raids by Australian authorities on Tuesday night, mere hours after the ABC sent the Chinese Government questions about the AFP investigation. The ABC claims they did not receive responses to any of these enquiries.

The Chinese Embassy later provided a statement to the ABC, however, saying it has ""provided consular support to Chinese journalists in Australia and made representations with relevant Australian authorities to safeguard legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens"".

Professor Chen, one of the scholars who received a letter from the Home Affairs Department advising him that his Australian visa was being cancelled, rejected the allegations levelled at him by the AFP, as well as any suggestions that he posed a risk to national security.

""I absolutely refuse to accept this assessment, and believe a gross mistake has been made regarding my relationship with Australia,"" he wrote in a statement to the ABC. ""The allegation that the [WeChat] group had been purported as a means of influence is simply preposterous … the Australian authorities must have access to the content of the group. It is plain to any eye that nothing in the conversations and postings in that group has the remotest complicity of anything suspicious.""

The other academic to have their visa revoked is leading Australian studies scholar, Li Jianjun.

The nullification of Chen and Li’s visas marks an escalation of the Australia-China diplomatic crisis, which had already reached new heights this week following the extraction of Australian journalists Mike Smith, a correspondent with the Australian Financial Review, and Bill Birtles, a correspondent with the ABC.

Both Smith and Birtles were pulled out of China late Monday night after a week of increasing hostility from the country’s Ministry of State Security. Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist working for China’s state broadcaster, was detained in China just a week earlier.

The incidents were the latest in a string of diplomatic skirmishes that have soured the relationship between Australia and China over the past few months, including disputes over Hong Kong, espionage, and responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Australia’s investigation into the possibility of Chinese political interference, and China’s furious backlash to those investigations, is now shaping up to be the latest such skirmish.",,
Here’s Why Kashmiris Fear That a Demographic Change Is Imminent in the Region,"Under normal circumstances, such a law which affects close to 10 million people would have been debated by people’s representatives. Except, in this case, not just were there no senior political leaders—who were either in jails or in house arrest—but the population was focused on battling the virus. The press was gagged by a New Media Policy , which threatened to incarcerate journalists for publishing “anti-national material.”

In March 2020, as the region was demanding more doctors and medical equipment to deal with the spread of the pandemic, the Government of India brought in a new domicile law. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of State Laws) Order, 2020—introduced on the night of March 31—defined who can own land and apply for government jobs in J&K.

J&K faced about eight months of strict curfews, with reduced mobility and internet shutdowns. Just as the situation was easing in March, COVID-19 struck, plunging the state back into another lockdown with the rest of the country.

It was not enough to revoke Article 370. India had to enact laws which would change the Muslim majority status of the state, according to Shrimoyee Nandini Ghosh, Assistant Professor at Azim Premji University, who works on Kashmir. The pandemic became a perfect cover.

According to The Brotherhood in Saffron, a book on the RSS by scholars Walter Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle, the RSS was opposed to the semi-autonomous status of J&K from the start and doing away with Article 370 was on the BJP’s election manifesto ahead of both 2014 and 2019 general elections. In both elections, India elected the BJP to power with absolute majorities.

The Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh or the RSS, whose formation was influenced by European fascist parties, is the ideological parent of the BJP. In many ways, New Delhi’s “takeover” of J&K in August last year is a culmination of the RSS’ decades-long dream of making India a Hindu Rashtra (nation).

On August 5, 2019, the federal government of India—led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi—did away with the quasi-autonomy accorded to it by Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. India’s only Muslim-majority state was brought under New Delhi’s direct control.

The state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) is surrounded by three nuclear-armed hostile nations - India, China and Pakistan. It has experienced decades of bloody battles with the Indian state.

Looked at from above, an angel’s wings appear to embrace the Kashmir Valley. Quite appropriate for a place known as heaven on Earth. The wings around Indian administered Kashmir are the snow-capped mountains of the Pir Panjal Range in the southwest and the Himalayas in the northeast. The fairy tale, though, ends there.

“This is the beginning of demographic change and, therefore, the domicile law makes India the Israel of South Asia,” said a Srinagar-based Kashmiri scholar who requested anonymity.

According to the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution of 1956, a Permanent Resident (PR) was anyone who was a state subject of J&K in 1954 under the monarchy; their descendants were also considered permanent residents. Anyone who lived in the state for 10 years before 1954 or owned land was granted the PR status. According to the March 2020 rules, anyone who has lived in J&K for 15 years or studied there for seven years or written class 10 or 12 board examinations in a school there, are eligible for PR. The first person to acquire a domicile certificate was a senior Indian diplomat from the eastern Indian state of Bihar, who was posted in J&K. “According to the 2011 census data, 1.5 million non-Kashmiris are eligible under the 15-year category. This number is 13-14 percent of the total population of Kashmir,” said Mirza Saaib Beg, a Kashmiri lawyer.

The children of Indian government officials, All India Service officers, other public sector employees and researchers who had spent more than 10 years in Jammu and Kashmir are also eligible to apply for domicile.

Beg noted that India’s population is 100 times that of Kashmir’s. Therefore, he said, engineering a demographic change will not be hard for the Indian government.

Immediately after the revocation of Article 370 was announced in August 2019, social media was flooded with messages claiming to sell property in Srinagar, which were later found to be fake. “Why this desperate desire to own Kashmiri land? What does it signify? If our lands are being taken away without our consent, it is surely an attempt to Hinduise India and bring about demographic change,” said the same Kashmiri scholar. “Much on the lines of what Israel is doing in the West Bank. India officially started its settler colonialism on August 5 last year,” he added.

In November 2019, Sandeep Chakravorty, India's consul general in New York, called for the adoption of the “Israel Model” in J&K. “If the Israeli people can do it, we can also do it,” he said in the video and quickly followed it up by stating that the current Indian administration is ""determined"" to do so. The Ministry of External Affairs did not comment on it publicly.

While senior diplomats liken India to Israel, activists and residents compare Kashmir to Palestine. A 17-year-old Kashmiri boy, who spoke to VICE News on the condition of anonymity for safety reasons, said that he is a part of a private Telegram group called “India = Israel.”",,
How a Year Under Lockdown Has Left Kashmiris Vulnerable to Land Grabbing,"He confessed that after being bound to his house for a year, his spot on the floor repulses him. “Now, I have nothing to do but sit by the window and dream of a time when I can get to my shop,” he said. Drabu owns a textile shop in Srinagar and says he isn’t sure he has the money to keep it. To do so, he might have to sell some land.

Haider Drabu used to love sitting on the floor. With a soft pillow to rest his back, he looked out of the massive window of his house in Pulwama district of Indian-administered Kashmir while sipping his noon chai—a pink-coloured, salty milk tea. “That used to relax me after a hard day’s work,” he said.

A year ago, people from other parts of India were not permitted to buy land or property in Kashmir. According to a businessman, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, New Delhi has deliberately kept the Kashmiri economy shut because a weak economy enables outsiders to grab land. “Nobody will have the financial power to resist a land takeover now,” he said, echoing Drabu’s fears.

Article 35A of the Indian Constitution gave the state government the right to define permanent residents — those eligible to apply for state government jobs and buy land. “The biggest blow to Kashmiri independence and security of land was caused by the repeal of Article 35A,” said Aijaz Ashraf Wani, Professor of Political Science at Kashmir University. Now, New Delhi defines who is entitled to such rights in Kashmir.

By virtue of being the only Muslim majority state in a Hindu-dominated India, J&K was protected by several laws under the Indian Constitution that gave it “special” status. This meant, most laws passed in New Delhi were not automatically applied in J&K until the state legislature approved them. Such autonomy was granted to protect the state’s unique identity and history.

Approximately 12 million people in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) have practically lived in a lockdown for a year, sometimes with no telephone lines or internet. On August 5, 2019, the Government of India imposed a strict curfew on J&K and revoked the limited autonomy granted to the state under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution.

Once 35A was gone, New Delhi had to simply make changes to several other laws to take the land. For instance, on July 17, the Department of Information and Public Relations of J&K released a short statement which said that New Delhi would declare certain areas “strategic” by amending two J&K land laws. These amendments would permit security forces to construct buildings beyond cantonments.

Land ownership and possession are defined by several hundred laws across the country. Lands for community use, those owned privately, those earmarked for infrastructure projects, those in border areas all have different laws to govern their use. In short, land legislatures in India are a complex matrix.

After nine months of curfew, just as J&K was opening up in March this year, the pandemic struck, bringing along with it a stricter lockdown. The state stands paralysed for close to a year now. In the middle of these restrictions, New Delhi has altered existing laws and passed new ones which observers say actively aid the grab for land.

Rashid is also referring to the application of India’s Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (Sarfaesi) Act, 2002, which was previously unavailable to J&K. In case of a loan default, only permanent residents of the state would be permitted to bid for and own assets auctioned by banks. “So, anyone who defaults on a loan is at risk of having their land taken over by the Central Govt and auctioned to outsiders. This is the grand scheme of land grab,” said Rashid.

“The deliberate destruction of J&K’s economy due to curfews has the effect of making people bankrupt and default on loans, so that their land may be auctioned,” said Shehla Rashid, a Kashmiri scholar and activist. “Earlier, it wasn't possible to auction land to outsiders even in the event of bankruptcy because of Article 370, but now that barrier has been cleared.”

In Kashmir, there is an armed personnel for every seven civilians, making it one of the most militarised regions in the world. The last elected government of J&K, headed by Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, wrote to the state legislature in 2018, confirming that close to 50,000 acres of land in the state is under “unauthorised occupation of the Indian Army.”

The Indian government also removed all references to the notion of a “permanent resident” in the J&K Property Rights to Slum Dwellers Act, 2012, thereby opening up smaller tracts of land for those from outside the state.

Wani believes this would affect Jammu more than Kashmir. Hindu-majority Jammu’s fate was sealed with Muslim-majority Kashmir during the latter half of the 19th Century. Since India’s independence though, the state’s politics has been dominated by leaders from Kashmir.

Jammu is a trading centre and is geographically connected to states such as Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. When New Delhi announced the revocation of Article 370, political leaders in Jammu came out in support. But, even the members of ruling BJP’s Jammu Unit opposed the revocation of Article 35A. When laws such as the Slum Dwellers Act allow people from other parts of the country to come and settle in the state, they are likely to come to Jammu because of easy accessibility and larger markets. “Jammu and Kashmir have different histories, demographics, geographies, requirements and demands, but they can stand together against the dilution of land laws,” said Wani.

In February this year, mineral blocks on the banks of the river Jhelum — that flows through Kashmir — were thrown open for mining. River Jhelum and its tributaries are Himalayan rivers and have large reserves of mineral-rich sand deposited on their banks. The call for bids was routine. However, this time the process was to be entirely online. The state government conducted auctions for mining tenders online this year so as to make the bidding process transparent, said Mirza Saaib Beg, a Kashmiri lawyer.

Kashmir, though, had no internet since August. “It was no surprise that an overwhelming number of tenders were taken by non-locals,” he said. In Srinagar and its neighbouring district of Budgam, all the tenders were given out to non-Kashmiris. “This is not just a takeover of Kashmiri land but of their resources also,” said Shrimoyee Nandini Ghosh, Assistant Professor at Azim Premji University, who works on Kashmir.

According to miners in the state, the reason why they have not “over-mined” with a view for profit is that they care about their lands. “We will not be greedy and wreck our backyard but we can’t say that about outsiders,” said a miner who hopes to gain a contract in another district and therefore requested anonymity. He said he wanted to bid in Srinagar, but the notice for auction of 10 mineral blocks in Srinagar was published on December 21, while there was no internet in Kashmir.

The laws relating to exclusive rights on land originated when the Hindu Dogra kings ruled the region. They wanted to prevent a takeover of the lands mostly by Punjabi settlers from the plains.",,
Kashmir Has Been Under Siege for a Whole Year. Here's a Timeline.,"Jammu and Kashmir has been the subject of a territorial dispute between India, Pakistan and China since the mid-20th century. This region sits atop India’s most northern point, and was until 2019 India’s only Muslim-majority state, which granted it a separate flag and constitution. However, on August 5 last year, India passed a resolution to extend control over the area, removing its autonomy and statehood.

Now, one year later, India’s government plans to mark the anniversary of this abrogation with a celebration they’re calling “Ek Bharat, Ek Atma Bharat (One India campaign) in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). The country’s ruling party is calling the event “a historic day.”

It has however been a tumultuous year for the Kashmiris.

In 2019, India’s government labelled their move a “complete integration” of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) into the Indian Union. It reasoned that this would end a three-decade-long militant separatist movement and bring development to J&K.

Kashmiris, however, saw their integration as a threat to the state’s ethnic character, and a milestone on the road to the realisation of the BJP’s dream of a fundamentally Hindu nation.

The move was part of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s many controversial decisions after his landslide reelection last year. His other controversial move came with the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December 2019. The law cleared the pathway to citizenship for individuals belonging to six religions—except Islam—from neighbouring nations. It led to nationwide protests, communal riots and the mass detention of anti-CAA protesters.

The abrogation led to breaking up of J&K into two territories directly administered by the Government of India: one that combines Hindu-majority Jammu and Muslim-majority Kashmir, and Buddhist-majority Ladakh.

The move electrified Modi’s supporters across the country, including the Kashmiri Pandits who were forced out of the Kashmir valley in the 1990s when Muslim militants burned their homes, reportedly displacing over 250,000 people and driving them out of the state. An “excited” BJP leader stirred controversy when he said they will now be able to “get married to fair girls from Kashmir”.

While the rest of India celebrated, debated and protested they changes, Kashmir was inundated with security personnel and placed under a communication blockade that has still hasn’t lifted. For this reason, the region has remained largely silent. Here, we look at the key moments of the past year:

August 3, 2019: Thousands of students, tourists and pilgrims were ordered to leave Indian-administered Kashmir after officials sounded a “terror threat” on the India-Pakistan border. In the meantime, around 45,000 troops are deployed, along with barricades and riot control vehicles.

August 4: In response to the tensions on the ground, 18 mainstream state political leaders came together and vowed to maintain a united front to protect the autonomy and special status of the state.

Later that night, many political leaders from that group—including former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti, Omar Abdullah and president of the Peoples Conference party, Sajad Lone—were placed under house arrest. Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code—which prevents a gathering of three or more people—was imposed in the city of Srinagar, along with a partial suspension of mobile internet services.

August 5: Home Minister Amit Shah moved the resolution to revoke Article 370 and Article 35-A of the Constitution in the Upper House of the Indian Parliament in New Delhi. The announcement led to an uproar by Opposition members. Some tore their clothes, while others tore copies of the Indian Constitution. Kashmir Valley was forced into silence as a complete communication blackout was imposed.

August 9: A series of protests broke out in Srinagar. Reuters reported Indian police using tear gas and pellets to fight back at least 10,000 people. On August 10, Vasudha Gupta, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, called the news reports “completely fabricated and incorrect”.

August 29: International media outlets report mass abuse of Kashmiris by the security forces. The BBC reported that several villagers faced beatings, torture, pellet gun attacks and night raids. The Indian Army called the claims “baseless and unsubstantiated”.

September 6: News agency Reuters reported the arrest of nearly 4,000 people since August 5 in one of the India-administered region’s “biggest crackdowns”. While the basis of arrest was not clear, an Indian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that many were being held under the Public Safety Act (PSA). The Act allows the state government to detain a person up to two years without trial. By now, more than 200 politicians were in jail, along with over 100 leaders and activists from an umbrella organisation of pro-separatist political groups. Amnesty International India called the invocation of PSA a “blatant abuse of the law by the Indian government.” Landline telephonic communication was restored in central, south and northern Kashmir districts. Still no internet or cell phone lines.

September 22: Amid the unrest, PM Modi visited the United States and met President Donald Trump for a ‘Howdy Modi’ rally in Houston. Five days later, he addressed the 74th session of the UN General Assembly and said, “India’s message to the world is peace and harmony”. On the sidelines of the same event, President Trump met Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and said he hoped the two countries “came together” on Kashmir. PM Khan, on the other hand, warned India of bloodbath once India lifts curfew in Kashmir.

October 14: Some mobile phone services were restored, but there are continued reports of violence in the form of grenade attacks.

October 23: India held local body elections in Srinagar amid boycotts by Opposition parties. Regional political parties termed the elections “undemocratic” in the light of detention of their colleagues.

October 28: Around 23 Members of the European Parliament made a “private visit” to Kashmir—the first since August 5. The visit drew criticism over the fact that over a third of the delegation were from far-right parties in Europe. It also came at a time when Indian political leaders and journalists were denied access to the state. The EU Parliament stated that it did not endorse the visit. Five migrant labourers from the eastern state of West Bengal were shot dead by terrorists in south Kashmir.

November 1: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, while on a trip to New Delhi, said the situation in Kashmir is “not sustainable and must improve.”

December 18: The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the region’s main trade organisation, reported a loss of $2.4 billion since August 5.

January 10, 2020: The Supreme Court of India said an indefinite internet shutdown in Kashmir is illegal. Four detained political leaders were released.

March 13: Prominent politician and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah was released from detention. His son, Omar Abdullah, also a former chief minister, was released weeks later.

March 21: Amid COVID-19 outbreak and an impending nationwide lockdown, United Nations special rapporteur David Kaye said Kashmir’s internet shutdown “cannot be justified”. As the world buckled under the pandemic, Kashmiris struggled to get reliable information about the novel coronavirus.

April 1: The Indian government rolled out new definitions of domicile for Jammu and Kashmir. It states that a person residing there for at least 15 years will now be eligible to be a permanent resident of the newly-designated Union Territory. It also grants domicile to those who studied in the state for seven years, and did their class 10 or 12 from a school there. Kashmiris criticise the law and call it “textbook Israeli-model”.

April 21, 2020: Police booked two Kashmiri journalists under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, for their coverage of the post-abrogation conflict and alleged “fake news”.

May 5: Three Kashmiri photojournalists— Dar Yasin, Mukhtar Khan and Channi Anand—won the Pulitzer Prize in ‘Feature Photography’ category for their coverage of Jammu and Kashmir. Some BJP leaders criticised the award and said the photographers’ work depicted “anti-India sentiments”. Mobile internet services at 2G speed restored in the state, except the restive Pulwama and Shopian districts.

June 11: Reports of community transmission of COVID-19 emerged from the state. The state crossed the 15,000-mark in COVID-19 positive cases in 145 days on July 22. Kashmiri doctors alleged harassment and assault by security forces.

July 30: Government of India officials stated that they released 90 percent of 6,605 persons who were taken into preventive custody since August 5. Those include political heads, sympathisers of militant outfits, stone-pelters and separatists. News reports state that nearly half of total inmates in a South Kashmir jail, which also includes political prisoners, tested positive for COVID-19. Some political leaders allege that those not formally in detention centres were detained illegally in their own homes. In a video dated July 30, member of the Congress party and former Union Minister Saifuddin Soz was dragged away by security forces while telling the press about his illegal detention.

The Jammu and Kashmir administration also decided to continue internet restrictions to 2G on postpaid sim cards for security reasons.",,
Turkish Ultranationalist Group the Grey Wolves Linked To “Hunt For Armenians” in France,"Hundreds of Turkish ultranationalists have marched through the streets of two French towns, chanting threats against Armenians, as tensions over the war in Nagorno-Karabakh boiled over.

A French anti-racism group and an organization representing France’s Armenian community said what they called the “hunt for Armenians” was orchestrated by the Grey Wolves, a militant Turkish ultranationalist group which is active in Western Europe and banned in a number of countries, including Austria. Footage of the marches, which took place on Wednesday night, was circulated on Twitter accounts featuring wolf emojis and references to the Turkish name of the ultranationalist organisation, Bozkurtlar.

The International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) and CCAF, the Coordination Council of Armenian Organisations in France, both called Thursday for the Grey Wolves to be banned.

“French people of Armenian origin must be able to live in France in safety, without being targeted by acts of violence and racial hatred,” the CCAF said in a statement.

A spokesperson for the CCAF, who did not want to be named for security reasons, said no Armenians were injured during the intimidating marches, as most people were at home due to coronavirus restrictions.

But her organisation was hugely concerned by the incident, which for her community carried echoes of the Armenian genocide under the Ottomans.

“We saw hundreds of Turks going into the streets looking for Armenians,” she told VICE News. “It’s a very scary situation and it reminds us of the darkest stages of history.”

The intimidating scenes took place in Vienne and Décines-Charpieu, both located near Lyon, a major hub of France’s Armenian community, which is the largest in the European Union. Armenia and Azerbaijan are locked in fierce fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway enclave within Azerbaijan which is run by ethnic Armenians, with the Azeris receiving heavy military support from Turkey.

Local officials and police said a mob of Turkish nationalists, estimated to number between 150 and 250, descended on Vienne at about 7.30pm. Footage from the scene showed a large crowd advancing on a rapidly retreating police car, waving Turkish flags and yelling. Explosions are heard and projectiles are seen hurtling through the air.

The mob then converged on nearby Décines-Charpieu, a heavily Armenian commune in the Lyon metropolitan area where the Armenian Genocide Memorial is located. Security was ramped up at the site once officials became aware of the trouble.

Laurence Fautra, mayor of Décines-Charpieu, said in a statement that a procession of about 250 people marched through the city centre waving Turkish flags, yelling violent threats like: “We are going to kill the Armenians.”

Regional officials tweeted that police had intervened to restore order in response to “an illegal grouping of individuals from the Turkish community, ostensibly wishing to do battle with people of Armenian origin.” It said order was restored without violence, with 65 people receiving verbal warnings for breaching coronavirus restrictions.

The marches followed violent clashes earlier Wednesday, when a group of pro-Armenian demonstrators blocked a motorway near Vienne, and clashed with members of the Turkish community. According to police, clashes with knives broke out, and four people were injured, including a 23-year-old man who was hit with a hammer.

French officials, police, and anti-racism groups all denounced the marches. The anti-racism group LICRA said in a statement that the gatherings amounted to “veritable pogroms against members of the Armenian community” and said the Grey Wolves “must be dissolved.”

France’s Independent Union of Police Commissioners also denounced the marches, saying that community groups did not have the right to “impose their own law.”

“Communitarianism must not take precedence over the Republic!” the group tweeted.

The CCAF spokeswoman said the tensions were a consequence of the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s bellicose statements against Armenia. She said her group was working with French authorities to prevent a repeat of the marches, and to try to outlaw the Grey Wolves in France.",,
"Kim Kardashian Helped Me With My Own Racial Identity, Until She Didn't","On Friday, Kim Kardashian West dropped her new coronavirus-inspired face mask collection , with masks for white, tan, brown, dark brown, and Black skin tones. While the tan and white face masks nicely reflect olive and peach flesh, the darkest mask for Black skin is just that: black.

Kim used to help me make sense of my own racial identity, until she didn’t—largely because of the never-ending cascade of Kardashian racial faux pas, of which the face masks are just the latest.

I remember as a teenager, waiting for my mom one day to pay for groceries in the checkout line when I stumbled upon a gossip magazine, Kim’s undeniably beautiful face looking at me. I’m Polish and Armenian, so like Kim, I have mixed Armenian heritage (she’s Armenian and a white blend). Sure, she represented a curated and obscenely rich version of someone like me, but to see a woman with Armenian roots and Middle Eastern features displayed on magazines as an opulent sex symbol changed the way I view myself, for better or worse, even if it didn’t change the way friends and strangers view me.

The staredown between me and Kim’s glossy image came at a time when I felt particularly uncomfortable in my skin. With my tan skin, black hair, and dark eyes, I didn’t look as “Canadian” as my friends, making Catholic high school in Edmonton difficult. Questions about my race and ethnicity followed me like a shadow. When I was minding my own business in biology class a white guy turned around and said, “You’d be more attractive with green eyes, Lebanese-like”; in Grade 12 math, a girlfriend looked at me and declared me a “brown Polish person” out of the blue; people would toss racial slurs targeting brownness my way (although I didn’t suffer this nearly as often as friends who are darker than me or not mixed). I was—and continue to be—asked where I’m from too often. So seeing Kim on not one, but several front pages sparked something like an internal revolution, especially when there are only about 11 million Armenians globally.",,
"The 'Bake Off' Celebrity Busts, From Cursed to Most Cursed","It’s good to know that even here, at the end of the world, there are spectacularly badly decorated cakes and the ability to televise them for a large audience to laugh at. After a short delay because of the pandemic, The Great British Bake Off returned last night, ready and willing to take our wearied heads into its giant and enveloping bosom, as if to say “I know you think my quality has worsened in recent times, and maybe haven’t watched the last couple of seasons, but I also know that it’s 2020 and there’s fuck all else on; besides, don’t you long for familiarity and the warm glow of some harmless rage provoked by Paul Hollywood’s general demeanour? Hush now, my child, hush.”

As such, the show delivered one of its best episodes in years, down in part to a genius Showstopper challenge, which instructed the bakers to create busts of their favourite celebrities out of cake. As a choice of task, it was utter internet pandering (remember “everything is cake”?), which is exactly what Bake Off should be doing, and yielded probably the funniest set of bakes ever done on the show. Here I have ranked these fine and noble creations from simply ‘cursed,’ to utterly nightmarish. Thank you to the bakers for what they have done for us all at such a challenging time, especially Marc, who made Ziggy Stardust look like Henry VIII at the end of his life.

This one is actually quite good – you can tell it’s Sir Dave at least; the shirt is very nicely done – and the only properly funny thing I have to add is the following picture of it momentarily falling over, which is just one of those things I will inevitably think about at inopportune moments in years to come, like when people tell me someone they know has died:

Mak’s Tribute to Bill Bryson

Again, pretty good! Not a huge amount to say here other than the fact that I just have this suspicion that this is not the first time someone has made a cake of Bill Bryson’s head. He just seems like the kind of man people make cake out of: I feel that it is not an irregular occurrence for Bill Bryson to turn up to a signing for whatever book he’s done about canals or trees (??) at a rural-ish Waterstones, and be presented with a likeness of himself made out of Victoria Sponge by an older lady called Ruth. Just has that vibe. Which is specific, I know.

You have to admire the skill here. Well put together; cleverly iced; nice painted-on decoration. But like. I dunno. There is something isn’t there, when you peer in a bit closer, look at it for a bit too long? Ah yes, that’s it. It looks like a sex doll, Peter.

I suppose this does resemble Louis Theroux in a way, but in a more serious and real way it also resembles an old man who would live next door to you and stare at you ominously over the garden fence every day for a calendar year until one day, he looks you directly in the eye and, in a remarkably clear voice, just says: “chebs.”

It is desperately funny to me that in amongst your David Attenboroughs and your Marie Antoinettes, someone decided to immortalise Tom Delonge – the man who wrote the lyric “Smoked a bong, killed a cat/Had my nuts attacked by rats,” among others – in cake bust form. Also, I never thought I’d see a flesh tunnel made out of cake, but here we are.

Behind the Scenes of 'TOWIE' with the Stars of the Show,"Amy Childs is feeling nostalgic today. It’s early evening, and she’s speaking to me from her car, a glossy, black Porsche 4X4 (number plate: WE11 J3L). On her way to collect her two young children after a day of shooting The Only Way Is Essex – the ITV reality show that made her famous, and which she recently rejoined for its 10th anniversary series – 30-year-old Childs has found time to reflect on her legacy.

Pitched by its creators as “Big Brother without walls” (other than MTV’s The Hills, a US production, Big Brother was the only frame of reference for proper reality TV that the programme makers had at the time), TOWIE represented the beginnings of an uncanny blend of reality and soap, which many initially found jarring. Ultimately, however, the combination of real emotion and structured storylines proved seductive – “How is it filmed? Is it fake? And why can’t we look away?” we asked collectively – as this new genre became the defining TV style of the 2010s, complemented by social media’s growing influence. After TOWIE, Made in Chelsea , Geordie Shore , and the current incarnation of Love Island all followed.

Childs was one of the original cast members of The Only Way Is Essex, or as it’s better known, TOWIE, appearing in the first two seasons of the programme in 2010 and 2011. A former beauty therapist, she’s right that she’s best remembered for her expertise in vajazzling (the precise art of applying crystal-shaped stickers to a client’s bikini line), which, as an indicator of an exaggeratedly glam “Essex lifestyle” depicted by the show, quickly became one of its hallmarks – along with spray tans, false eyelashes, and the sheer amount of head-exploding rage it drew from TV reviewers .

“I still get it now. People are like, ‘Oh my god Amy, do you still vajazzle ? You’re the vajazzle queen!’” she laughs. Hearing the word “vajazzle” coated in Childs’ recognisable Estuary twang is almost potent enough to transport me all the way back to 2010. “I’m so happy to be back on the show,” she carries on, bringing us back to the here and now. “It was something that everybody absolutely loved and still talks about now. For me to come back, it was honestly amazing. I feel like I’ve not left.”

But there was only one OG – and after a whole decade of parties and pettiness, plus the cultural proliferation of the phrase “I’m Gemma Collins, Ferne; I’m 34, I’ve earned my divaship,” TOWIE is still on air, for two seasons a year. So how has the show that changed everything managed to survive in such a saturated market? And seriously, how the fuck do they actually make it?

“They’ll just say to you, ‘Look, we’re rolling, you’re walking, you’re gonna bump into him and whatever happens happens,’” Sims explains. “For a TV show that can be quite tricky, because that could have been, like, a two second scene. But we ended up having a conversation, and therefore there is a scene for TOWIE. Had I decided to leave the scene and walk straight out, that would have been fine as well.”

“I think he was given the opportunity to reach out to me, and I was given an opportunity to reach out to him on camera. I refused, and I’m guessing he refused, because our first scene is a bump in,” Sims says. “On TOWIE, a bump in is when you just bump into someone that you’ve got confrontation with.”

As of the time of writing, 38-year-old mum-of-one Chloe Sims, a TOWIE cast member since 2011, has appeared on 282 episodes of the show, which is more than anyone else who has stepped through the Sugar Hut’s storied doors. She’s on set when she calls me at 8.30PM on a Friday, about to shoot a pivotal scene for her storyline this season, which centres around the real life fact that she and her best friend and co-star Pete Wicks haven’t spoken since before the UK went into lockdown in the midst of a global pandemic. Her first contact with Wicks only happened recently, when they’d filmed what TOWIE calls a “bump in”.

That the element of surprise is often so strong during the making of the show will probably be unexpected for some, because questions about whether or not TOWIE is scripted have hung over it since Denise Van Outen uttered the show’s famous disclaimer at the top of the first ever episode: “The tans you see might be fake, but the people are all real, although some of what they do has been set up purely for your entertainment,” it goes. For Sarah Tyekiff – TOWIE’s executive producer and the head of Unscripted TV at Lime Pictures, the company that makes the show – that statement is a bit of a bugbear. In fact, she says, it’s the one thing about TOWIE that she would change if she could do it all again.

Of course, scenes are set up and locations are booked – anyone who has seen the show knows this – but once the cameras are rolling, there is no input from the production in terms of how the cast members behave. “It is unscripted,” Tyekiff elaborates. “We don’t tell people what they’re going to say, and sometimes people walk into scenes and they don’t know they’re going to be there. It was quite hard to work out how much was scripted and how much was real until I got to Lime, and then I was pleasantly surprised that it was authentic. Actually, you watch the stuff and it’s so real because the cast are so brilliant, and give themselves to it so much.”

Ultimately, TOWIE’s cast are its lifeblood. From red wine swiller extraordinaire Lucy Mecklenburgh, to the inventor of “reem,” Joey Essex, via the GC herself (who was recently bestowed with TOWIE’s “Most Iconic” award in a 10 year anniversary special; she thanked viewers who voted for her in a pre-recorded video on a yacht), the personalities who have appeared on the show over the years make it what it is, in more ways than most probably realise.",,
A.G. Cook Is a Popstar Now,"Accompanying the Apple announcement was a video for the guitar-led single “Oh Yeah”. The clip features Cook – in a liquid-effect satin shirt, looking for all the world like a teen magician – performing deliberately in front of the camera. It was his first music video in his seven-year long career, and signalled the beginning of a new era: the era of A .G. Cook the artist.

On the 30th of July, Cook announced the release of 7G, a seven-disc, 49-track album that spans just over two-and-a-half hours. The record dropped quietly, in a midweek slot on the 12th of August, and on its own might have simply been seen as the move of a producer’s producer – 7G was Cook’s first full-length record under his own name, sure, but its long-form nature meant it could easily have been taken as the release of a bunch of historic material for the heads to pore over at their leisure. A week later, however, news came that Cook would be releasing another full-length, the much more concise Apple, on the 18th of September.

Since lockdown began, Cook has been living in the state of Montana – where his girlfriend, the musician Alaska Reid, grew up – quietly adding “outdoorsman” to his polymathic list of roles. So far, that list also includes record producer, “Creative Director” for artists like Charli XCX and Jónsi, founder of the once-notorious electronic label PC Music and, as of the last few months, actual popstar.

A. G. Cook recently got his fishing license. He’d be the first to tell you that he sucks at it, but let’s be realistic: how else are you going to spend your time when you’re quarantined in the American northwest during an international pandemic ?

As a Brit whose experience of the US is limited to New York City and Disney World Florida, I need some cues if I’m going to understand what Cook’s Montana-based lockdown has been like. Via a Zoom call (Friday night for me, Friday morning for him in LA, where he’s staying for a few days), he clutches for a reference.

“Yes,” I say, visualising the lush countryside and sweeping mountain ranges that I’ve seen on Kim Kardashian’s Instagram.

“It’s the other side of those mountains,” Cook explains, as his face – framed by dark curly hair and dominated by round glasses – bobs across the window. “It’s just above Wyoming. You have these small towns here and there. A lot of them used to be a gold rush or copper rush place. You have these weird settlements that are sometimes really elaborate, and, like, a railway. Tons of crazy mountains. You have to take bear spray if you go on a hike.” He pauses. “The bears are just out there.”

In between dodging bears and learning to fish, Cook has been working on his album rollouts against an enviable natural landscape. As the head of PC Music, he holds the process of releasing the music in almost as much regard as the material itself, and notes that he had always planned for his own music to come out around this time, even pre-coronavirus.

“Apple as an album was finished about a year ago,” Cook says. He explains that he wanted the record to be “tight and formal,” inspired by Charli XCX’s ten-track masterpiece Pop 2, which he executive produced in 2017. “I was kind of into that number, or even shorter. It puts a good weight onto the tracks that you’re with, and it’s a challenge to think about that. I wanted it to be quite a planned rollout.”

Apple, the album artwork for which looks like the front of a can of Monster Energy, essentially moves between two ends of a spectrum. On one side, there’s the expected smoke-‘n’-lasers, exemplified by tracks like recent single “Xxoplex,” which sounds like the dark underbelly of a foam party (only with a choral interlude, naturally). On the other, characterised by “Oh Yeah” and “Beautiful Superstar”, there’s more of a softness, which feels influenced by emo music, the Americana inherent to Cook’s current environment, and singer songwriters of the 1990s and 2000s (he cites Shania Twain and the “cheeky” style of her music’s production as a specific inspiration). As the record progresses, these elements merge together: ““Oh Yeah,” then “Xxoplex,” are the two poles of it, and then you hear hybrids of that as you go through. I think that’s something that a lot of people have done in a sense,” Cook says. “I’m just very transparent about it and push it a little bit further, but any album that’s good tends to have these really nice switch ups, otherwise it’s just annoying.”",,
We Went to the UK's First Socially Distanced Concert Venue,"It is the first Saturday in September and I am traipsing across a field in Newcastle, following yellow signs directing me towards the “ARENA”.

This is only the second time I have left London since March, when lockdown began, and the first time I have been to anything resembling a live music event.

For many reasons, it is weird to be here, in this park, in this city that I have only visited once before. It wasn’t so long ago, after all, that we were only let out of our homes to walk ourselves around parks for an hour per day, like dogs in ailing health, let alone allowed to travel around the country.

Another weird thing is the “ARENA” itself. Instead of your usual outdoor gig set-up (which generally goes something like: big stage, flanked by overcrowded bars and stalls selling “gourmet waffles”, with an open space in the middle where punters stand to watch the music), the place is full of what look like metal pig pens, only they’re for humans to watch concerts from.

Image by VICE

This is the Virgin Money Unity Arena, housed in Newcastle’s Gosforth Park. It’s the site of the biggest socially distanced concerts currently happening in the UK, and it is, necessarily, very odd. Over the past few weeks the site has hosted acts like Supergrass and Jimmy Carr, while later in September, Chase and Status, Boyzone’s own Ronan Keating and a number of various others performers will join the lineup.

A while ago, I got an email asking if I’d like to go there to see a concert, and I couldn’t figure out whether the invitation to the arena was one to witness the future of live music or the death of it. So I gathered up my face mask (to be worn in all communal areas throughout the venue, baby) and my esteemed colleague Hannah Ewens, and we went to decide for ourselves.

THE ARENA

Image by VICE

To allow for proper social distancing, the Virgin Money Unity Arena has 500 viewing platforms, for a maximum capacity of 2,500 people, which is about half of what Brixton Academy can hold. We booked in to see Maxïmo Park on the 5th of September, and they performed to a sold-out crowd.

When you arrive, you have your tickets scanned as you would at any outdoor concert, but before you actually enter the venue you’re handed a slip with a number on it. That number corresponds to what the arena niftily calls your “viewing platform”, i.e. the area that you and the other ticket holders in your “bubble” will watch the concert from, distanced from all of the other concert-goers. You can leave the platform to go to the bar if you wish, but only if you’re wearing a mask (you’re allowed to remove your mask on your platform).

Obviously, this isn’t an ideal way to facilitate the transcendent experiences that live music can produce; I don’t think anyone will be telling their grandchildren about the time they saw God during a concert where they were stood inside a mini-enclosure that looks so much like it was built for farm animals that it’s hard to think of any other way to describe it.

That said, while earlier in the evening I worried that there might be a bit of a sadness hanging over the whole thing, with the field steadily filled out to capacity – and in a sold-out crowd, listening to loud music under the lights – it was sort of like old times, if you squinted.

Image by VICE

It’s certainly not the same as it was – but for music fans, it’s a well-thought out way to revisit a much-loved hobby at a time when there’s no other choice but to be socially distant. I can attest to the fact that, if you were used to going to gigs, hearing live drums for the first time in months definitely gives you much more of a thrill than you’d probably expect.

THE FOOD AND DRINK

Looking back, the deeper we traversed into the 2010s, the more the Great British Festival became Coachellafied – AKA sponsored by Natwest, catered by Wahaca and as captured by influencers. Soon enough, everyone wanted more from their festi culinary experience than burger and chips three nights in a row.

These socially distanced outdoor gigs, though, are a return to the festivals of yesteryear, before the advent of vegan truffle mac-and-cheese and espresso martinis in plastic glasses. We’re talking pints of Carling and hot dogs. And that’s fine with me – maybe we needed to stop thinking about festivals as food industry trade events. Or maybe I’m just grateful to have live music back and want us all to be grateful.

THE SHOW

It’ll be a brand new skill for musicians to master for 2021: how to do banter with a small and ridiculously spaced-out crowd. The guys up there were trying, I think, but do you remember your first IRL conversations post-lockdown? It was like trying to speak Spanglish on holiday while having a caffeine-induced panic attack.

Overall, this gig was how I remembered shows from the Before Time, only everyone onstage looked like an alien doing their first show in human bodies. Also, I was an alien.

THE AMBIENCE

Image by VICE

Imagine a band playing just to you and your mates, but you’re half a field away from the band. It was something like that. The vibe was quite similar to being in a karaoke booth – consider it your own job to bring the hype. You’re in your little pen, like a group of sheep, and you’re aware that other people are having an alright time, but can you hear them and feel them? Not really, no.

Really, your enjoyment hinges on: a) how much you like the artist you’ve paid £70 to watch perform, and b) how good your mates are. No pressure, then, if you’re as fun as we are after six cans of Prosecco each.

THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE

Image by VICE

In general, the experience put me in mind of something like British Summer Time, the series of day festivals which take place in London’s Hyde Park every year, sponsored by Barclaycard. They’re fun, bombastic days out, where you usually see very popular artists play their music to a big audience.

The acts playing the Virgin Money Unity Arena have similar wide-scale appeal, because: a) this is one of the only chances people have to see live music at the minute, so the organisers obviously wanted to have a diverse and accessible spread of acts, and b) ultimately, the exercise is a business venture by a large corporation.

Much of the live music industry before the pandemic had corporate backing, so Virgin Money’s involvement isn’t anything new, and it doesn’t particularly take away from the fact that the concerts at the Unity Arena give people the chance to have a good time scratching an itch they haven’t been able to in some time. But what is a concern is that the first organisation able to mobilise a live music venue during COVID-time was a bank. Due to government inaction, many small venues – which provide the UK’s much-needed base for newer, weirder, more niche and emerging music acts – are either in massive financial precarity, or have already had to shut down.",,
Trump pulls out all the stops to attack Biden in Sunday Twitter barrage,"Sponsored Links

Go to a superspreader rally. Leave, tweet, repeat.

That’s Donald Trump’s modus operandi on the last weekend before election day.

Whether Trump’s statements about his opponent Joe Biden — whether in his tweets or in his rally speeches — contain even a shred of truth or not matters very little at this point.

If there still any undecided voters at this point it’s likely that they are a minuscule percentage of the overall populace and will be much more unlikely to change the balance of the election than spreading lies designed to encourage the president’s already committed supporters to actually make it to the polls in an atmosphere of voter intimidation and pandemic paranoia.

Nonetheless, Trump slathered his tweets with lies and accusations against the former Vice President that only served to remind the president’s most fervent detractors of his own multiple misdeeds since he tends to accuse his opponents of exactly that which he himself is most guilty.

Take this tweet from this afternoon and substitute Trump’s own name for Biden’s to get a true picture of reality for everyone except the Republican candidate and his followers.

He shows up every 4 years, and then goes back to D.C. and caters to his special interests. My only special interest is YOU. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2020

The idea that the notoriously self-serving Trump gives a whit about anyone except himself and those who could benefit him personally is laughable to anyone not blinded by the right-wing propaganda factories serving up his electoral lies undiluted by fact.

Despite the fact that Joe Biden is the most moderate of the Democrats who sought the presidential nomination this year, Trump continues to portray his agenda as that of a dangerous, God-less socialist in direct contradiction of Biden’s own words and the Democratic party platform.

Biden will terminate school choice, eliminate charter schools, defund religious schools, ban prayer in public schools, indoctrinate your children with Anti-American lies, and force you to subsidize extreme late-term abortion. We believe that every child is a Sacred Gift from God! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2020

Every accusation in that last tweet is an insult not only to Biden’s actual views but to the intelligence of anyone who reads it.

Parents, in particular, should know that not every child is a “Sacred Gift from God,” especially since the president himself was once a child — albeit a spoiled and privileged one — and his existence is surely more of a curse from any deity who was responsible for his creation.

Even more ludicrous was Trump’s characterization of the people who support him versus the people who have already decided to vote for Biden.

Joe Biden is the candidate of rioters, looters, arsonists, gun-grabbers, flag-burners, Marxists, lobbyists, and special interests. I am the candidate of farmers, factory workers, police officers, and hard-working, law-abiding patriots of every race, religion and creed! #MAGA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2020

Anyone truly law-abiding simply can’t wait to see Trump stripped of his presidential immunity so he can be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for his numerous floutings of the laws that he seems to think don’t apply to anything that he does.

One can only wonder how gullible Trump voters must be if they swallow this truckload of intentionally false claims, misrepresentations, and outright lies.

It’s hard to fault Trump for trying to continue to mislead his voters who have invested so much of their identities into his electoral success.

He knows that prison likely awaits him if he loses this election and has nothing more to lose by committing any additional fraud at this point.

Soon, however, the forces of good in this country will regain control, and scrolling through Twitter to see Trump’s latest posted atrocity will become a faint memory of these nightmare times.

Now go vote and make sure that a happy future can truly manifest itself.

Texas Supreme Court delivers a massive setback to the GOP in curbside voting decision,"Sponsored Links

The Republican party’s antipathy to the full exercise of every American citizen’s right to participate in our democracy has long been documented with suppression efforts ramping up since the Supreme Court invalidated the Voting Rights Act back in 2013.

Since that fateful decision, voter suppression efforts have taken many forms, from the purging of voter rolls — a significant factor in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election — to the elimination of polling places in historically Democratic districts to attempts to intimidate voters with threats of violence that have already been taking place in this current election to even a slow down of the U.S. Postal Service delivery to prevent ballots from arriving on time to be filled out or counted.

No attempt to disenfranchise voters who have already cast their ballots legally has been more blatant than the actions of the Texas Republicans who took their case trying to invalidate nearly 127,000 ballots — cast at drive-thru polling sites set up in order to make voting safe during the COVID-19 pandemic in the relatively blue bastion of Harris County which includes the city of Houston — to the Texas Supreme Court.

The GOP activists tried to argue that the drive-thru program was an expansion of curbside voting, and under state election law should only be available for voters with disabilities, despite the fact that drive-thru ballots account for about 10% of all in-person ballots cast during early voting in Harris County.

The rejection of these ballots could determine the outcome of an election in Texas that has turned much more competitive than any Republican could have imagined before Donald Trump’s disastrous handling of the coronavirus pandemic sent normally reliable GOP voters scrambling for an alternative and motivated Democratic-leaning voters to rejoin a political process they may have skipped in the last presidential election.

Any hopes that these anti-democracy forces in the GOP had having the Texas Supreme Court assist them in stealing the rights to have the drive-thru voters’ voices heard in this election were dashed today when the court denied their petition to have the ballots disallowed in a decision issued without a written opinion.

Local election officials in Harris County rejoiced at the news.

“We know that the law is on our side,” Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins told CNN after the Supreme Court issued its ruling. “We know that we should be protecting these votes, making sure that all of our residents here can have their voice heard, can have their say in our democracy.”

Add your name to tell Democrats to EXPAND THE COURT in 2021!

The citizens who have already submitted their ballots assuming that they were making valid votes are still not assured that their votes will be counted, however.

The Republican plaintiffs are still pursuing a similar lawsuit in federal court, hoping to get the votes thrown out by arguing that drive-thru voting violates the U.S. constitution.

It will be interesting to see how the originalists on the Supreme Court, including the recently installed Amy Coney Barrett, tackle this issue that was likely never contemplated in the horse and buggy days of our nation’s founding fathers.

Suffice it to say that any attempt to invalidate the ballots of legitimate voters — no matter how they cast their votes — simply demonstrates the fact that, despite their attempts at portraying themselves as the party of the educationally-challenged blue-collar class, the GOP is a party of elitists who are afraid to face true democracy and can only retain power for their oligarchical masters by cheating in any manner that they can and invalidating legitimate votes.

Let’s hope that they find no more success in the federal courts than they did in the Texas judicial system.

Trump spends sleepless night posting partisan attacks in extraordinary Twitter rage,"Sponsored Links

As the witching hour of election day draws near, Donald Trump mounted an early morning Twitter offensive today that, while presenting a brave and confident face, clearly indicated that the president is lying awake at night in sleepless concern about the record turnout in this contest so far.

He began his insomniac session at 3:26 AM with a warning shot to those conservative Republicans who may dislike Trump’s personality and performance but who have blocked their olfactory organs to tolerate the stench of corruption and incompetence because the president has reliably delivered them a bevy of extremist right-wing federal judges who will help enforce their vision of an America rooted in the disappearing values from before the middle of the 20th century.

People have long been voting but Joe Biden has still not released his Supreme Court List of Radical Left Judges that he would like to put on the Court. Also, is he going to Court Pack? He thinks he can bluff his way through these two important questions. Can only vote against!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2020

For the vast majority of Americans for whom the COVID-19 pandemic and its related financial concerns form the most pressing issues heading their worry lists, Biden’s judicial strategy is far from the top of their minds.

It seems as if, even in the last days before the final ballot is cast, Trump can’t move beyond trying to shore up his base of right-wing ideologues and at least attempting to appeal to a wider spectrum of voters.

Sponsored Links

It is hopefully a fatal mistake that will damn his re-election bid by limiting his appeal only to the minority who already support him, a diminishing percentage of Americans as the pandemic reaches new heights while Trump lies that the nation is “turning a corner” against the virus.

Trump continued his self-delusion in his next post, a mischaracterization of the national and state-level polls that could be repudiated by the tiniest bit of research by anyone who reads it.

Unless the president knows something about voter suppression plans yet to be executed, every public indication shows that it is his campaign that is headed for the chasm, not the coalition of progressive and moderate Democrats, independents, and revolted, repulsed straying Republicans that are aligned against him.

In his sleepless propaganda push, swing states weighed heavily on the president’s mind.

Trump needed to come up with something to advance his case in Michigan, a state he narrowly won in 2016 in part by making exorbitant promises about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state.

In his next post, he created a fairy tale version of his record in addressing the state’s manufacturing employment deficit that likely won’t fool anyone with direct experience of the state’s current economy.

…The place was a mess and would have lost much more business if I hadn’t come along. Many new plants are starting. Foreign countries and companies now treat the USA, and Michigan, with respect. Big jobs plans. Please remember this when you go to cast your very important vote! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2020

Who can know which countries Trump is referring to when he says that they are now treating the U.S. and Michigan with respect?

It certainly isn’t our former Europea allies who have snickered behind his back at his ignorant arrogance and incompetent diplomatic efforts.

His continual lies about Michigan’s economic reality aren’t likely to change their opinion of him, especially when the truth is that manufacturing jobs over the last three years have increased in Michigan by less than 2% — half the national average and that the state lost 5,300 manufacturing jobs last year, the first decline in manufacturing jobs in the state since 2009, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

Trump may have then tried to fit in a little shut-eye since he waited until nearly 5 AM to begin posting again, launching a series of false accusations against his Democratic opponent Joe Biden.

He started by trying to turn the African American youth vote away from their demonstrated support for the candidate who doesn’t spend his rallies spouting racist dog whistles.

Joe Biden called Black Youth SUPER PREDATORS. They will NEVER like him, or vote for him. They are voting for “TRUMP”. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2020

With nary a true word included in that last tweet, Trump delved even further into paranoid fear-mongering with his next post of COVID denialism, employing pandemic fatigue as a careless weapon against Biden in a move that may backfire considering the record explosion of cases — particularly in swing states — in the past week.

Biden wants to LOCKDOWN our Country, maybe for years. Crazy! There will be NO LOCKDOWNS. The great American Comeback is underway!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2020

Trump acts as if COVID-19 needed additional help in spreading itself across the country and he is providing a new Marshall plan to aid the disease in its deadly multiplication.

A couple of hours later, Trump again demonstrated that he still thinks he’s running against Hillary Clinton when he returned with a repeat of his lie that Biden called young Black men by a term once uttered by his former opponent, but never by his current one.

Joe Biden constantly used the term “Super Predator” when referring to young Black Men, according to my sources. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2020

The president continued to post his partisan attacks by spreading doubts about the accuracy of the polls showing him far behind his rival in the popular vote again, including this one to file in the “words to be eaten with pitiful hindsight” category.

Unless Congressman Jordan is privy to some secret polls or plans to disrupt the conduct of the election set for a record turnout, it’s difficult to see how his prediction was anything more than a Halloween whistling in the dark during the frightful leadup to election day.

With only two more days before we hopefully get the first indication of the margins that Trump will lose to Joe Biden by, the president’s last-minute attempts to turn back the political tide that will wash him and his administration out to sea are a likely futile move that will flounder in the rolling seas as he’s dragged under the crashing blue waves.

Trump openly muses about stealing the election in tweet attacking vote-counting,"Sponsored Links

Donald Trump isn’t hoping for a legitimate election. He knows that he’s lagging far behind Joe Biden in the polls and that he stands a strong likelihood of losing the presidency if every ballot is counted and the will of the American people enacted. It’s why he’s been trying to smear mail-in voting for months, alleging that it leads to rampant voter fraud despite the mountains of evidence to the contrary. This is a man who neither respects nor believes in American democracy.

Due to the already historic voter turnout this year and the spike in mail-in votes in response to the ongoing pandemic, there’s a nonzero chance that we won’t have a clear winner declared on election night and that it could take days or even weeks to count all of the ballots. In such a scenario, under normal circumstances, this would be cause for annoyance but not concern. The correct solution would be to simply continue counting votes until we have a full tally. Unfortunately, the would-be authoritarian in the White House is already attacking that basic idea.

Speaking to reporters this week, Trump claimed that it would be “very, very proper and very nice if a winner were declared on November 3rd instead of counting ballots for two weeks.” The implication here, of course, is that Trump thinks he might be ahead in the vote count the night of the election only to lose after more votes for Biden are tallied. He went on to call counting the votes past the 3rd “inappropriate” and erroneously claimed that it might even be against the law.

Add your name to demand Pence stop endangering lives to campaign as the virus spreads through his inner circle!

It cannot be stressed enough just how dangerous this kind of rhetoric is. Trump is laying the groundwork for his followers to declare the election in his favor even if he loses so long as he achieves some kind of lead in the early ballot count. Many of these supporters are heavily armed and hang on his every word, having long ago forsaken reality for the manufactured fantasy world peddled by their ignorant leader. By talking like this the president is opening the door to violence.

There’s also a distinct possibility that Trump will dispute the election and try to take it to the Supreme Court where, with its now incredibly conservative majority, it’s possible the will of the people might be annulled in favor of Republican minority rule.

Trump seems fixated on the idea and today he lashed out at the Supreme Court for making the decision that North Carolina should extend its acceptance of absentee ballots. The incredibly tame ruling says that mail-in ballots are valid and must be counted up to nine days after they’re received. The president called it “CRAZY” and “so bad for our Country.” He asked if his followers can “imagine what will happen during that nine day period,” implying that some kind of ballot trickery will occur. He ended with his nakedly partisan and utterly ridiculous claim that the election should be called on November 3rd, making it clear that he has no interest in the will of the American people.

That said, all of these concerns are moot points if Biden manages to achieve a blowout victory. The best strategy now is to hand him such an overwhelming win on election day that Trump has no choice but to accept it. Vote and make sure everyone you know does as well.

With Joe Biden narrowly ahead of Donald Trump in most polling in the swing state of Florida, the president brought his COVID superspreader tour to Tampa today to endanger the lives of his supporters in the state.

A mostly maskless crowd — packed in like sardines in an epidemiologist’s worst nightmare — was treated to an opening act of the First Lady Melania Trump shilling for her soon-to-be-unemployed husband by repeating his loathsome lies.

While Florida had seen a reprieve in new COVID-19 cases after a massive peak in July, in the past two weeks the coronavirus has resurged with a 47% increase in new cases during the past two weeks. Don’t expect that number to drop after the president’s reckless campaign strategy.

The denialism of science-backed lockdowns as an effective solution to help reduce the spread of the virus hardly indicates a focus on “destroying the virus and building back the economy” as Melania Trump claims her husband is doing.

The stock market gyrations of the past few days indicate that even Wall Street is realizing that without effective measures to control the spread of COVID, the American economy is unlikely to recover quickly.

How many of the people in the picture below will soon be the proud possessors of a pre-existing condition that the Trump administration is actively fighting to remove guaranteed coverage for in its attempts to repeal Obamacare in the courts?

Trump’s malicious ignorance of the scope and nature of a disease that he himself fell prey to was evident in his gross misestimation of the number of fatalities that the coronavirus has caused in this country.

America cannot afford to continue to let this president destroy our nation and its citizens’ health.

Get to the polls and vote Donald Trump and the Republican party out of office before it’s too late.

President Biden will implement a national plan to fight the disease and a Democratic Congress will pass a stimulus bill that will help ordinary Americans rather than just serve to further enrich wealthy corporate interests.

It may be too late for those Trump supporters who have risked their health by attending the president’s desperate last-minute rallies, but it’s the only way to ensure that our country combats the pandemic and gets back on the right track in every way.

Wisconsin’s GOP-stacked Supreme Court forces state to hold primary during pandemic,"Sponsored Links

It became just a little harder to disprove the theory that Republicans only care about themselves and aren’t the least bit concerned whether you live or die after the decision made today by the Wisconsin state Supreme Court.

Democratic Governor Tony Evers issued an executive order this morning postponing the state’s primary election scheduled for tomorrow over concerns that it would be impossible to hold a fair election — or even properly open a sufficient number of polling places and staff them properly in the midst of the social distancing guidelines due to the coronavirus outbreak.

“I cannot in good conscience allow any types of gathering that would further the spread of this disease and to put more lives at risk,” Evers told the press after he signed the order. “I have been advised by public health experts at the Department of Health Services that despite the heroic efforts and good work of our local election officials, poll workers, and national guard troops, there is not a sufficiently safe way to administer in-person voting tomorrow.”

After Evers’ sensible decision, Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled state legislature filed a motion with the court to issue an emergency restraining order reversing Evers’ potentially life-saving decree.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court — with at least two conservative justices appointed by Governor Evers’ right-wing predecessor Scott Walker still sitting on the bench — granted that restraining order this afternoon, forcing the state to hold a primary under the most dangerous conditions imaginable and taking GOP voter suppression tactics to a new low.

“The governor does not have constitutional or statutory authority to modify, suspend or otherwise alter the statutes. Nor does the governor have the constitutional or statutory authority to set the time, place and manner of elections,” Wisconsin Republican legislators wrote in their quickly-filed petition.

The ruling to overturn the Democratic governor’s life-saving emergency order may eventually backfire on the GOP legislators — particularly if anyone passionate enough about exercising their voting rights contracts the COVID-19 virus as a result of the Republicans’ venal political games — but the short-term effect will likely be a massively lower turnout in the only state primary scheduled for April that has not been postponed.

Sponsored Links

The Wisconsin Supreme Court’s ruling endangers not only the people who may decide to risk their safety and cast their ballots but, because of a lack of poll workers — 7,000 of whom have declined to work during the pandemic — National Guard members in the state will be called up to staff the election.

Sponsored Links

Ironically, because of the lack of staff, the number of polling places will be severely reduced meaning that those that do open will be more crowded — and dangerous for everyone who should be social distancing to avoid infection — and more difficult to reach.

Sponsored Links

With a bevy of local races for offices whose current occupants’ terms expire this month at stake — in addition to the presidential candidate preferences — postponing the elections was never an easy choice for Governor Evers to make. The state Supreme Court’s ruling is all the more controversial because a seat for that body is also up for grabs in tomorrow’s election, creating a powerful conflict of interest for the court in this matter.

As a Democratic governor with a Republican-controlled legislature that has done everything it can to strip him of powers that his predecessor was able to exercise easily, Evers had to make a difficult choice after his last-minute appeal to the legislature — which has the sole power to move the primary according to the state constitution — to convene in an emergency session today to vote to move the election was ignored without any action whatsoever from the GOP to try to protect both its citizens and their right to vote in a less than potentially deadly environment.

Evers has called on the legislature to meet again tomorrow to enact a measure postponing the ballot, but, as of now, it looks like the Wisconsin primary will be moving forward tomorrow, come rain or shiny new disease.

Hopefully, when the general election comes in November, Wisconsin voters will remember which party was concerned with their health and well-being and which was willing to let them risk infection and possibly even death as the price for exercising their constitutional rights.

Trump accuses “LameStream Media” of pushing virus safety to hurt his reelection,"Sponsored Links

Narcissism. Paranoia. Delusions.

These serious signs of mental illness require the invocation of the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump from the helm of an America that is quickly resembling The Titanic after hitting an iceberg that was in plain sight while the captain was trying to convince all the passengers on-board that the chunk of the broken-off glacier was merely a mirage.

Unfortunately, none of the Republican toadies in Trump’s cabinet who could take this necessary action have the intestinal fortitude to rise to the occasion, even in these most desperate of times.

Narcissism, paranoia, and delusion were all on full display this afternoon as the president launched into an unhinged rant against his favorite target: the media that reports the real, verifiable facts about what has been occurring and continues to happen in this country during the coronavirus pandemic that Trump failed to move quickly enough to minimize, rather than the alternative facts that seem to exist only inside the president’s disturbed and disordered mind.

The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2020

With a complete inability to see beyond his own interests in being reelected — and the possibility of losing the race including his likely indictment on a wide range of charges for which he’s been immune from prosecution as a sitting president overseeing the Department of Justice that maintains that dubious constitutional opinion — Trump is basically telling the American people to screw the sound judgment of medical experts to maintain a national quarantine for as long as is necessary to prevent the deaths of potentially millions of Americans unable to be saved by an overwhelmed, understaffed, and under-equipped healthcare system and get the hell back to work to ensure that the economy recovers enough to give him a strong argument for a second term.

“Real people ” may “want to get back to work ASAP,” but anyone with an ounce of intelligence and an instinct for self-preservation that is a mere fraction of the president’s own butt-covering reflexes would likely prefer to preserve their own lives and those of their families and friends than go out there and win one for the Gipper Grifter.

The type of person who follows Trump’s unconvincing “inspirational” call to return to work before anyone but the president — and his billionaire corporate cronies who’ve grown fabulously wealthy off the backs of American workers while refusing to guarantee their healthcare or pay taxes sufficient to provide social services — believes that it is safe to do so is likely to find themselves not “stronger than ever” but potentially dead or with permanently reduced lung capacity.

While many may think that anyone foolish enough to believe a president with a demonstrable record of compulsive fabulism over a doctor when it comes to dealing with a pandemic is just a form of social Darwinism that will reduce the pool of available voters who are also dumb enough to give Trump a second term, many of these people — with proper care and deprogramming of the years of right-wing propaganda fed to them by Trump and his right-wing media partners in crime — can return to productive roles in society…if they ignore the president and allow themselves the chance to stay uninfected and alive.

Trump may be playing a long game here and simply be protecting himself from post-presidential prosecution by establishing a bona fide insanity defense well in advance of any actual trials.

Let’s not fall prey to his machinations. If Trump tries to reopen America prematurely, simply ignore him and stay home as part of a general strike that should only end when every American has a guarantee of affordable universal healthcare and a living wage — all funded by taxes on the billionaires who have siphoned all the wealth from the disappearing middle class since the Reagan era.

"Trump defies doctors’ advice, says he wants everyone crowded into churches on Easter Sunday","Sponsored Links

Trump is counting on the Resurrection to give new life to the American economy and, by extension, to his now dwindling chances at remaining in the White House past Inauguration Day 2021 at a point when many people are wondering whether they will live long enough to see that auspicious day.

With Trump’s attention span shorter than the life of a particle generated by the Hadron supercollider, his patience with the nearly unanimous recommendations by healthcare experts — to keep everyone in the country not in an essential job on lockdown and away from their workplaces and schools to avoid the catastrophic rise in the number of infected Americans that would overwhelm the capacity of our healthcare systems — has worn thin.

Now the president is vowing to end quarantine restrictions and get people back to work — and in contagion range — by Easter Sunday.

He explained why in an interview with the one network that isn’t now cutting away from his uninformed coronavirus press briefings the minute that he starts spouting dangerous misinformation, Fox News.

(The clip is the second in the Twitter thread below.)

Trump’s insane idea to pack people crowded together into churches as the perfect coda to the social distancing that may have saved their lives to that point is akin to the plottings of an evil supervillain with a dastardly plan to cull the herd of gullible humans willing to pledge their fealty to a false messiah on a religious holiday that he twists for his own purposes.

It’s difficult to determine whether the stupidity of the president’s idea is outweighed by its malevolence and self-interest, but with all of these factors in play, suffice it to say that the American people need to simply ignore whatever Trump, their employers, or anyone else who urges them to prematurely end their period of social isolation may tell them and keep themselves and the rest of the population safe by staying away from other people until assured by bonafide medical experts that it is safe to do so.

Still, Trump’s apparent belief that he can order people to end their state and city imposed quarantines to magically resurrect the economy in time for Easter Sunday requires a level of faith in both his intelligence and his competence that he has not earned in any way, either during this health crisis or in the rest of his presidency preceding it.

And if Trump himself winds up catching the coronavirus that is already spreading through the nation’s capitol and infecting prominent politicians like Senator Rand Paul, you had better believe that not only will Trump be swearing that he was referring to Easter of 2021, but that his prayers for resurrection will be loud and plaintive.

Virus expert Dr. Fauci pleads with Trump team to not reopen economy early over the election,"Sponsored Links

A tiger can’t change its stripes, and Donald Trump can’t change his essential inability to chose the right decision no matter what situation he finds himself in.

Anyone hoping that the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic disaster would elicit some previously unfound depths of intelligence, rationality, and beneficence in the president was always certain to be disappointed when the same proudly uninformed, injudicious, and misanthropic Trump continued his self-absorbed obsessions with his own ego and managed the crisis more for his own benefit than in the public interest.

Trump’s behavior since the very beginnings of the coronavirus outbreak has been self-serving, starting with his initial downplaying of the dangers the pandemic posed and continuing through the supposed pivot to treating the crisis seriously wherein he has continued to spread false hope about untested cures while fretting more about how the economic catastrophe accompanying the medically required shutdown of most non-essential businesses in the country will affect his reelection chances (with the possibility of post-presidential prosecution potentially lingering in the back of his mind.)

It should come as no surprise then that the president tweeted out an all-caps cry of frustration at the extreme measures of social distancing and quarantine that have shut down much of the commerce in the nation and devastated both the stock market and Trump’s most important campaign marketing message, his claim of responsibility for the growing economy that he inherited from Barack Obama.

WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020

Trump’s tweet elicited paroxysms of horror from health officials — including the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci — who fear that Trump will arbitrarily end the extreme policies keeping people indoors and isolated from each other that — while economically difficult — are the only method to stop the spread of the vicious virus and prevent an increase in both the infection rate and the subsequent death toll.

Even normally reliable Trump boot-licker Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has urged the president against ignoring the advice of medical experts and listening to his economic advisors instead.

“It would be a major mistake to suggest any change of course when it comes to containment,” Graham told The Washington Post in an interview. “I just spoke with Dr. Fauci — he believes that if anything we should be more aggressive and do more. … You can’t have a functioning economy if you have hospitals overflowing. People aren’t going to go to work like that.”

Dr. Fauci has been doing his best to counter the misinformation about the pandemic and potential solutions disseminated by the president with actual facts but admitted in an interview with Science magazine on Sunday that he can only so so much.

“I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Fauci said, according to the interview . “OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time,” he continued.

Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, told the newspaper that Trump was on the wrong course if he advocates an early end to social restrictions.

“We haven’t yet even seen signs that the growth is slowing, much less reversing. Now is the time to tighten restrictions on contacts that could transmit the virus, not loosen them,” Lipsitch said. “If we let up now we can be virtually certain that health care will be overwhelmed in many if not all parts of the country. This is the view of every well-informed infectious epidemiologist I know of.”

While the president’s tweet brought plenty of blowback from medical professionals who pointed out that saving lives was a more important aim than salvaging his reelection bid, Trump doubled down on his outburst by retweeting it 12 hours later to make sure no one would miss his impatient deadline.

CNN‘s diligent fact-checker Daniel Dale proved that the direct pipeline between the Fox News airwaves and Trump’s brain was still fully operational by showing the likely origins of the president’s tweet in a Fox News broadcast last evening.

Fox News host Steve Hilton last night: “You know that famous phrase, ‘The cure is worse than the disease’?

Perhaps if we had a president who would get his information and make crucial decisions after reading detailed intelligence briefings summarizing the opinions of experts instead of parroting Fox News’ radical right-wing copywriters we wouldn’t be as far into the exponential spread of the coronavirus as we currently are and would actually have enough testing kits to determine the true extent of the contagion.

Alas, we don’t. We have Trump, at least for the time being, and we are paying for that foolish decision by a small minority of voters in a handful of swing states with the lives of Americans all across the country as a result.

Trump and Barr’s DOJ seeks power to detain prisoners without trial during national emergency,"Sponsored Links

National emergencies often require extraordinary measures that would be unthinkable in normal times as millions of people ordered to stay at home and shelter in place are now discovering.

Unfortunately with the current administration proving daily that it is prioritizing its own aims over the general health and safety of the American people as a whole, many people are asking themselves whether the emergency powers being requested by the administration as it struggles to make up for the time it lost while Donald Trump was downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis —despite having been briefed on the oncoming pandemic and the nation’s lack of preparedness for it — may give the president powers that he will twist for his own purposes to further push the nation towards authoritarian rule.

At least part of these types of fears stems from the request for emergency powers that Attorney General William Barr and the remnants of the once-respected Justice Department have been quietly discussing with Congress as the nation faces a crisis unlike any seen in the last century.

According to an article in Politico, Barr and the DOJ are looking for permission to void the constitutional right to a speedy trial by allowing them to request that judges hold people in detention for an indefinite and unlimited amount of time without trial during a declared emergency.

While the quarantine orders in place in much of the country will likely render the normal course of justice nearly impossible to continue as the difficulty of finding jurors to serve in criminal trials in crowded courtrooms that can turn into viral incubators if an unknowingly infected person enters their midst, those who remember the cavalier declaration of a national emergency that Trump made when Congress refused to allocate money to build the border wall that he promised Mexico would pay for realize that granting such powers to Trump’s executive branch of government would bring us halfway to the dictatorship of his dreams.

As Politico writes:

Sponsored Links

“The move has tapped into a broader fear among civil liberties advocates and Donald Trump’s critics — that the president will use a moment of crisis to push for controversial policy changes. Already, he has cited the pandemic as a reason for heightening border restrictions and restricting asylum claims. He has also pushed for further tax cuts as the economy withers, arguing that it would soften the financial blow to Americans. And even without policy changes, Trump has vast emergency powers that he could legally deploy right now to try and slow the coronavirus outbreak.”

The changes that Barr seeks would devastate the constitutional right of habeas corpus, the mandate that anyone arrested be swiftly brought before a judge and be able to present a plea and petition for their release.

Sponsored Links

The Justice Department is seeking the ability to keep people in detention “whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation” and would apply to “any statutes or rules of procedure otherwise affecting pre-arrest, post-arrest, pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures in criminal and juvenile proceedings and all civil process and proceedings,” as the draft legislative language reviewed by Politico read.

Norman L. Reimer, the executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers explained the problem that this presents to habeas corpus rights.

“Not only would it be a violation of that, but it says ‘affecting pre-arrest,’” Reimer said. “So that means you could be arrested and never brought before a judge until they decide that the emergency or the civil disobedience is over. I find it absolutely terrifying. Especially in a time of emergency, we should be very careful about granting new powers to the government.”

The Justice Department has also asked Congress to extend the statute of limitations for criminal investigations and civil proceedings during national emergencies, “and for one year following the end of the national emergency,” according to the draft legislative text seen by Politico. It has also asked for the ability to let court appearances take place by videoconference without the consent of the defendant, violating the time-honored rights of the accused to confront their accusers face to face.

While it is unlikely that any of the Justice Department’s requests can get past the scrutiny of a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, the very attempt to try to ram such an outrageous violation of civil liberties through Congress during a pandemic and to have those powers be available anytime the president arbitrarily declares a phony national emergency is indicative of the Trump administration’s totalitarian leanings and its contempt for America’s long tradition of civil liberties.

At least one progressive Democrat, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), has taken note of the Justice Department’s request and given the request a hard pass.

It’s likely that her Democratic colleagues will agree and prevent this particular power grab from taking place, but it shows the need for constant vigilance in the face of the Trump administration’s attempts to suspend parts of the U.S. Constitution that don’t fit its expansive visions of executive power.

One thing to note about the Justice Department’s request that could immediately lead to its withdrawal if pointed out to the president: the pausing of the statute of limitations for criminal investigations and civil proceedings during national emergencies would mean additional time to prosecute Donald Trump once he leaves office and the phony claimed immunity from prosecution that he enjoys as the sitting president.

Hopefully, we can then have a newly trustworthy Justice Department at the ready to reinstate the investigations of Trump’s malfeasance and prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law, and, unless Congress passes the DOJ’s current request, he’ll be able to petition the court for release on bail until his trial. With the wealthy former president posing a serious flight risk, that’s not a step that any intelligent judge would be likely to grant.

GOP Senator argues that coronavirus fears are overblown because only 11 million Americans may die,"Sponsored Links

Either some Republicans are really as heartless and uncompassionate as their reputation says they are, or Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) is just really bad at math and has no idea what he’s saying.

Neither conclusion is particularly heartening, especially when Senator Johnson and his Republican colleagues still control one of our nation’s two legislative bodies that America is counting on to come up with adequate solutions to the health care capacity issues and the onrushing major depression caused by Donald Trump’s refusal to take the COVID-19 pandemic seriously enough and quickly enough to prevent the widespread dissemination of the virus throughout all 50 states.

Senator Johnson was trying to paint a more optimistic picture of the current situation when he spoke to The New York Times and complained that the media was distorting the picture of the coronavirus’ effects by focusing on the extraordinarily high rate of fatalities caused by the virus in comparison to the ordinary flu that Trump was comparing it to just a few short days ago.

“One thing the press has not covered at all is the people who have really recovered,”Johnson, a reliable Trump ally, told The Times. “Right now all people are hearing about are the deaths. I’m sure the deaths are horrific, but the flip side of this is the vast majority of people who get coronavirus do survive.”

Senator Johnson’s sunny “look on the bright side” outlook provides cold comfort for anyone whose grandparent just passed away after catching the deadly respiratory virus.

If that was all Johnson said, one could chalk it up to an attempt to keep spirits up during this trying time, but he continued down a path that proved that his callousness exceeded his mathematical abilities in a followup interview with a home-state newspaper, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinal.

Sponsored Links

“I’m not denying what a nasty disease COVID-19 can be, and how it’s obviously devastating to somewhere between 1 and 3.4 percent of the population,” Senator Johnson said.

“But that means 97 to 99 percent will get through this and develop immunities and will be able to move beyond this. But we don’t shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways. It’s a risk we accept so we can move about. We don’t shut down our economies because tens of thousands of people die from the common flu,” he continued.

Craig Gilbert, the Journal Sentinal reporter speaking with Johnson, pushed the senator on his comparison of the coronavirus to the much less deadly common flu and got him to acknowledge that CODID-19 has a much higher death rate, but still, Johnson insisted that “getting coronavirus is not a death sentence except for maybe no more than 3.4 percent of our population (and) I think probably far less.”

A death rate of 3.4% sounds like a small fraction, but when you consider the current U.S. population is estimated to be around 327 million, the raw numbers a simple mathematical calculation produces helps you realize that Johnson is dismissing the deaths of 11 million Americans as a small price to pay to keep the U.S. economy humming along nicely for the GOP’s wealthy donors.

If Senator Johnson is so unconcerned about the potential deaths of 11 million Americans, one must ask the question of Wisconsin voters: Is this the man that you want to represent you and your families — including those elderly family members who will be overrepresented in the fatality tolls — as Congress addresses the pressing decisions that the coronavirus crisis presents?

Perhaps only a maximum of 3.4% of Senator Johnson’s constituents would agree that 11 million deaths is an acceptable toll to pay for a stable stock market, but we think it’s probably far less. Even in raw numbers that percentage should be small enough to elect someone new when his term is up in 2022.

Unless, of course, that 3.4% estimate of coronavirus fatalities includes his own death, which would only go to prove that COVID-19 at least has a sense of irony.

Idaho Republicans ignore coronavirus crisis to focus on bills keeping trans kids out of sports,"Sponsored Links

The coronavirus epidemic has increasingly halted business as usual from being conducted across nearly all of the United States in the last few days.

Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of a pandemic will stop right-wing Republican extremists from the swift completion of their appointed culture wars, however, as the Idaho legislature proved early this week.

As of yesterday, Idaho was under a state of emergency declared by GOP Governor Brad Little in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and school districts were beginning to close, but the Republican-controlled legislature was too busy passing bills harmful to its transgender citizens to get around to considering any emergency measures to address the effects of the epidemic in the state.

On Monday evening, the Idaho state Senate passed a bill that had already been approved by the state House of Representatives that prohibited the alteration of gender designations on birth certificates issued by the local government.

The bill will now go to Governor Little for his signature and — unless he decides to take the advice of the state’s attorney general and veto it to avoid the inevitable expensive federal court battles that will ensue and likely overturn it — will become the first of three anti-transgender proposals currently under consideration in Idaho.

Sponsored Links

The other two consist of a bill that would prohibit transgendered girls from participating in sports with those born as biological females and legislation that would make it a felony to treat gender-displaced youth for gender dysphoria.

Sponsored Links

While it’s condemnable enough that the Idaho legislature is fiddling with right-wing dog-whistle cultural issues rather than focusing on public health and safety during this crisis, the action on birth certificates is even more egregious considering the fact that a substantially similar previous measure has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court that also ordered the state to create a process free of “onerous burdens” to make changes to gender designations.

Sponsored Links

Idaho Deputy Attorney General Brian Kane believes that the new bill will face the same legal barriers as the previous legislation did, despite the attempt to bypass the court ruling by using a “biological basis” for sex designation on birth certificates, using the need for accurate record-keeping by the government as an excuse.

According to Kane, The legislation “appears to try to thread the rapidly shrinking constitutional eye of a needle.”

“This office cannot determine at this point whether that eye can be threaded with [the bill], but notes that based on the existent case law it will likely require the State to litigate this matter to the United States Supreme Court.”

Legal experts estimate it could cost the state $1 million to litigate the court challenges if it is signed into law, but at least one Idaho state Senator sees that as a useful way to spend taxpayer dollars.

“I think we all understand what the costs and what the risks are in making the decision to go forward,” Republican state Senator Jim Rice told NBC News.

While voters in Idaho are among the most conservative in the country, it is unlikely that at a time when the US economy is rushing into recession faster than a log flume ride at a water park that its fiscally conservative residents would approve of such a wasteful expenditure of money that could be used for so many more worthwhile purposes during the health and economic crisis that has arrived so suddenly.

The GOP credo of limited government is facing its biggest challenge ever as the public realizes the value of government institutions and, yes, socialism in this emergency situation. Yet, Idaho Republicans seem to think that the concept of limited government doesn’t apply when their cultural sensibilities are offended, despite all the “Don’t tread on me” and “Live free or die” bumper stickers they proudly display.

Hopefully, voters in Idaho will remember that their Republican elected representatives in the state fiddled with trivial political games while their state burned with virus-induced fevers when they go to the polls in November and elect more responsible leadership.

Trump crony David Clarke floats postponing 2020 election in coronavirus tweet meltdown,"Sponsored Links

You would think that even the most ardent Trump supporter would be beginning to have doubts about the qualifications of Donald Trump to continue hosting the reality show that his presidency has turned into after his jump-the-shark performance bungling the nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Instead, at least one devoted Trump acolyte is proposing postponing the 2020 presidential elections to ensure that the nation must suffer from a surfeit of incompetence in its leadership for an unearned and unelected additional four years.

David Clarke, the former sheriff of Milwaukee County in Wisconsin who has been a vocal supporter of the president, made the suggestion in an unhinged Twitter rant complaining about American society’s panicked reaction to a virus with a fatality rate much higher than the ordinary flu he foolishly compares it with.

Pause for a second and think about how we have responded to COVID19. We closed America, we crashed the economy not on the basis of factual information but out of panic, fear & hysteria. We call out the national guard. New viruses will appear in the future. Is this the new normal. — David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) March 15, 2020

When a LEFTY says they favor shutting down society for the rest of the year I say OK lets do it, that includes the 2020 Nov elections. It’s status quo then and @realDonaldTrump remains President until the next election in 2024. Wouldn’t want anybody catching the FLU at the polls. — David A.

Such moronic comments demonstrate the lengths to which Trump’s base will delude themselves to ignore his obvious failure to deal with the rapidly-spreading health crisis and its devastating economic fallout as they see his chances of reelection fading as quickly as the pulses of frail and elderly victims of the COVID-19 virus.

Sponsored Links

According to the watchdog group Right Wing Watch, Clarke’s rant was originally even worse.

They report that Twitter deleted three of the former sheriff’s posts for violating the platform’s policy against encouraging harmful behavior when Clarke tweeted this rallying call for virus-skeptical right-wingers.

“GO INTO THE STREETS FOLKS. Visit bars, restaurants, shopping malls, CHURCHES and demand that your schools re-open. NOW! If government doesn’t stop this foolishness…STAY IN THE STREETS. END GOVERNEMNT CONTROL OVER OUR LIVES. IF NOT NOW, WHEN? THIS IS AN EXPLOITATION OF A CRISIS.”

Twitter told me that it removed three of David Clarke's posts from yesterday for violating site policy against encouraging self-harm.https://t.co/yJxfNM3DZr — Jared Holt (@jaredlholt) March 16, 2020

The fact that the Twitter responses to Clarke’s post contained as many — or more — positive reactions to his statements as they did abject denunciations of his unthinkable proposals may have more to do with the fact that his social media following consists primarily of those who have watched his appearances on Fox News and other right-wing extremist media outlets than a more representative sampling of the American public.

Given Donald Trump’s own “joking”(?) references to trashing the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution that limits presidents to just two four-year terms, Clarke’s radical proposal — even if made only in satiric hyperbole in reaction to the hoarding of toilet paper — should inspire fear among those who are already concerned about whether Trump will leave the White House willingly if he loses the election in November.

As political Comedian Bill Maher has stated many times, he believes that Trump will declare the election rigged if he loses and will refuse to accept the results in a bid to retain power and avoid the almost certain prosecution that has been held in abeyance while he controls a Justice Department that maintains that a sitting president can not be indicted for any crimes.

If the coronavirus is still virulent in November, then mail-in ballots can dominate the polls.

Even better would be an even more radical proposal, an immediate plebiscite on whether Donald Trump should continue in office even another day as his incompetence drives the country to new lows, both medically and financially.

Trump threatens to pardon national security advisor who pled guilty of lying to FBI in Russia probe,"Sponsored Links

For once Donald Trump has used quotation marks properly in one of his tweets.

Unfortunately, the context of that he used them in was in highlighting the flimsiness of his excuse for “strongly considering a Full Pardon” for General Michael Flynn, his first National Security Advisor who has been trying to reverse his guilty plea after confessing to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russian diplomats during the transition to the Trump presidency.

So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has “lost” the records of General Michael Flynn. How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2020

Yes, the quotation marks around “lost” indicate that the supposedly missing records connected to the case are a complete mischaracterization of the legal dispute over FBI notes made while interviewing Flynn and compiling a report on his activities initiated by Flynn’s new legal team and that the president likely sourced from Fox News who have been pushing this deep state conspiracy theory.

Besides being another example of Trump focusing on politics and interfering in the normal course of justice to try to exonerate his 2016 campaign from the taint of Russian assistance in his election —interference that has been confirmed by every major US intelligence agency — Trump’s foreshadowing of yet another pardon of a corrupt associate after a spew of controversial pardons that include a NAVY Seal accused of war crimes and politically connected figures who have been convicted of many of the same types of crimes that the president himself has been accused of — former Arizona Sherrif Joe Arpaio (obstruction of justice), former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik (tax evasion), former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich (abuse of power and corruption), among others — adds insult to injury at a time when the nation expects the president’s full attention to be on the government response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Spokeswoman says it’s OK to ignore experts because Trump is “the best authority” on virus,"Sponsored Links

How brain dead do you have to be to buy the lies being peddled by surrogates for Donald Trump on our nation’s airwaves?

The president sent Kayleigh McEnany, the press secretary for his 2020 reelection campaign, to speak on his behalf to Stuart Varney on Fox Business today and inevitably the topic of the coronavirus pandemic that’s been roiling the global economy was front and center in their discussion.

Varney asked McEnany about the recommendation made by the federal government’s top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, that the public should avoid large gatherings of people, a recommendation that has resulted in the cancelation of conventions and music festivals across the country and the playing of NBA games to completely empty arenas.

It was a particularly pertinent question less than 24 hours after the president announced that he would proceed with another one of his ego-stroking campaign rallies in Milwaukee next week in the midst of a pandemic-induced national hysteria, but the press secretary treated it as just another opportunity to score political points against Trump’s leading Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.

“Look, we have the commander-in-chief, we have the best health experts,” McEnany gaslighted the audience. “We’re taking this day by day. We’re currently proceeding as normal. Joe Biden is suspending his rallies. He’s been dying to get off the campaign trail. He can only speak for seven minutes.”

A skeptical Varney interjected a dose of reality into McEnany’s political attack dog rant.

“You will immediately be accused of chaos in the White House,” Varney astutely pointed out. “The president goes ahead with holding his rallies. His top doctor — top medical guy — says don’t go with big crowds. I mean, you’re immediately going to be hit with this.”

It was the campaign press secretary’s next statement that caused mouthfuls of coffee to be propelled in astonished spit-takes across the nation in reaction to her North Korean-like unmitigated adoration of the “Dear Leader” she serves.

“Look, the president is the best authority on this issue,” McEnany responded obsequiously. “He takes into consult the words of everyone around him.” “So, I’ll leave it to the president,” she continued. “Joe Biden is looking for an excuse to get off the campaign trail. And let me just add, the media’s best hope is for Donald Trump to suspend his rallies. They’ve been wanting to stop this, his avenue to speak directly to the American people.”

Once the viewing audience picked their jaws up off the floor, they may have realized that Trump’s propensity to “speak directly to the American people” through the unmediated platforms of social media will, unfortunately, continue unabated whether he puts the health of thousands of his cult members at risk by herding them together in a crowded arena like cattle with hoof and mouth disease or not.

McEnany’s false confidence in the president’s command of the science behind the coronavirus pandemic ignores his clear disregard of expert advice in favor of his incessant need for the constant ego-gratification he needs as he feeds his vampire soul with the cheers of thousands of his MAGA-hatted deludables.

You can watch this astonishing display of destructive, dangerous, and thoughtless fealty in the video clip below, but if you sincerely believe that Donald Trump is “the best authority” on anything other than on P.T. Barnum style hucksterism and pernicious self-dealing con games, by all means, skip the video and go straight to the next Trump rally to prove your loyalty to the president in a game of viral roulette.

Trump joins the fray in Schumer and Roberts controversy with a series of savage tweets,"Sponsored Links

After an extraordinary exchange of outrage between Chief Justice John Roberts and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) earlier today, you knew it wouldn’t be long before Donald Trump inserted himself into the fray.

Sure enough, Trump’s tiny little Twitter fingers were typing out his own predictably partisan and constitutionally ignorant opinions on the accusations flying between the leader of the Supreme Court and the head Democrat in the senate over Schumer’s warning of political retribution from a furious public towards Trump’s conservative court picks if they limit women’s right to determine their own biological fates.

“I want to tell you, Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch, you have unleashed a whirlwind, and you will pay the price,” Schumer said to an activist crowd in front of the Supreme Court this morning. “You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.”

Chief Justice Roberts interpreted Senator Schumer’s words as a threat, and despite failing to step in when Trump himself attacked his more liberal colleagues, Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg, last week for a legal dissent that the president didn’t even understand, issued a condemnation of Schumer’s words.

“Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,” Roberts warned in a statement after hearing Schumer’s comments.

Senator Schumer’s office replied back quickly by issuing the following statement:

“For Justice Roberts to follow the right wing’s deliberate misinterpretation of what Sen. Schumer said, while remaining silent when President Trump attacked Justices Sotomayor and Ginsberg last week, shows Justice Roberts does not just call balls and strikes,” Schumer’s statement read.

At this point, Trump went off the deep end sending this unhinged tweet that seemed more suitable coming from a third-world dictator than an American president:

Trump fails to mention that after his shameful acquittal by a compliant majority of Republican Senators, the chances of any member of the GOP getting arrested or impeached or having any sort of repercussions for any potentially illegal actions is slim to none, particularly after his own demands that Justices Sotomayor and Ginsberg recuse themselves from any case involving his administration generated nary a peep from Roberts or any Republican legislators.

If only those were Trump’s last words on the subject. After a pause for a few more standard blasts of self-promotional propaganda, Trump returned to the topic with a second tweet.

There can be few things worse in a civilized, law abiding nation, than a United States Senator openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the Supreme Court or its Justices. This is what Chuck Schumer just did. He must pay a severe price for this! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 5, 2020

As a man who has spent more than his fair share of time attacking the fairness of judges and the U.S. judicial system, it’s difficult to see Trump’s attack on Schumer as anything but the most blatant example of politically-motivated hypocrisy he’s generated in hours, at least.

Take a look at a few examples of his own threats and accusations towards those who preside over the administration of justice.

There has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the Roger Stone case. Look at her background. She never revealed her hatred of “Trump” and Stone. She was totally biased, as is the judge.

Justice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster.

After reading this small sample of the president’s thoughts on the American judiciary, there can be only one response:

There can be few things worse in a civilized, law-abiding nation, than a United States President openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the Federal Courts or its Justices or a duly-elected U.S. Senator. This is what Donald Trump has repeatedly done and just did again. He must pay a severe price for this!

Since impeachment now seems off the table, the price will be at the ballot box in November and it is getting bigger every day he stays in office.

Trump’s crony in Homeland Security refuses to quit after judge rules he was illegally appointed,"Sponsored Links

After a federal judge ruled in a rare Sunday decision that Ken Cuccinelli — the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security — was illegally appointed to his position, the partisan Trump appointee has said that he will refuse to leave his post despite the court ruling.

U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss issued a 55-page decision yesterday that concluded that “Cuccinelli was not lawfully appointed to serve as the acting Director of USCIS” and, even more crucially, determined that the policies that the improperly appointed acting Director mandated regarding the treatment of asylum seekers “must be set aside.”

Judge Moss based his decision on the evidence that the appointment of the former Virginia Attorney General and failed candidate for governor of that state did not meet the requirements of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998.

Cuccinelli told Fox and Friends today that he would simply ignore the judge’s decision while appealing the ruling.

“The succession for the deputy secretary of homeland security ties back to my official position as the principal deputy at USCIS [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services], there’s not a problem with me at my current position,” Cuccinelli told the Fox News morning hosts today after initially chortling at the news. “The only issue in the case is related to being the acting director at USCIS. And this ruling is really something of an outlier. This is a methodology that has been used in the past. It’s been thought of as legal as — pretty broadly.” “You can expect to see those efficiently reissued … and that’s just as a precautionary measure as an appeal goes forward. It’ll be business as usual until it’s played all out,” Cuccinelli said.

For Cuccinelli, “business as usual” includes continuing to amend, create, or end immigration-related policies in his acting role, despite the explicit instructions by Judge Moss that all of the policies that he’s approved while working in his current position must be rescinded.

While the same methodology may have been used in the past to appoint people to an acting position, once a judge declares it illegal, it is, in fact, illegal, and a refusal to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court could result in contempt charges against the improperly-named acting deputy secretary and his illegally-issued anti-immigrant policy proclamations.

Sponsored Links

The challenge to the legality of Cuccinelli’s appointment was spearheaded by, among others, the Democracy Forward Foundation, a Washington-based legal services organization that sued over Cuccinelli-backed policies that the group claimed made it much more difficult or even impossible for some asylum seekers to have their claims considered at southern border crossings.

Cuccinelli’s bold rejection of a legally binding court decision sent shivers down the spines of those people who believe that no matter what the margin of the Democratic victory in the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump will declare that some unspecified irregularities should invalidate the results and will consequently refuse to vacate the White House while claiming a stolen election.

If public uproar over Cuccinelli’s blatant rejection of the rule of law doesn’t force him to comply with the judge’s order, then Judge Moss should follow the advice that the president always suggests when he accuses his political opponents of any type of wrongdoing even before a judge has ruled on the validity of the charges he’s leveled and lock up the illegitimate acting deputy secretary for contempt of court.

"Trump Sunday tweet roundup — Pandemics and politics, Fake News and FISAGATE dominate his mind","Sponsored Links

Whether it’s the fact that his body clock is still recovering from his recent trip to India and the reported sleepless journey home or that he’s just so consumed with applying hand sanitizer to ward off coronavirus that his tiny fingers are too slippery to type properly, Donald Trump’s social media post schedule has been thrown off-kilter from his typical pattern of a barrage early morning tweets.

While the president did wake up early enough today to post a cheap shot at Democratic presidential hopeful Mike Bloomberg, announce a new coronavirus screening procedure at U.S. airports, and advertise a MAGA-friendly taco shop, he took a mysterious five-hour break before resuming his addiction to oversharing his brain farts.

His first post naturally was one of self-praise as he cited a poll that he erroneously attributed to The New York Post but is actually a two-week-old Gallup survey that claims 77% of Americans have confidence in his administration’s ability to handle the coronavirus pandemic.

A Poll in today’s New York Post says that 77% of “U.S. adults have confidence in their government’s ability to handle the Coronavirus (Number One), compared to other health threats.” 64% for Zika, 58% for Ebola. Others way down on list. Our professionals are doing a great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2020

While for once Trump is accurately reporting the numbers contained in an opinion poll, he fails to mention that the survey was completed two weeks ago, before the disease began spreading extensively in this country, before the first death from the virus occurred here, and before the administration’s early missteps in handling the outbreak were publicly disclosed.

The president next moved on to his controversial re-nomination of Congressman John Ratcliffe (R-TX) to be his next Director of National Intelligence.

Sponsored Links

Trump had previously nominated Ratcliffe to the same position last summer, only to have the conservative Texas representative withdraw his name from consideration after opposition from the Senate over concerns by former intelligence officials that Ratcliffe might politicize intelligence and after media reports criticized his record in prosecuting terrorism and immigration cases.

Now that Trump has been acquitted by a compliant, Republican-controlled Senate of the impeachment charges he faced, he likely feels that he can get them to roll over at his command and confirm anyone he nominates, no matter how partisan and unqualified for the sensitive position that they may be as he attempts to install loyalists at the top of the intelligence community.

“Who better than @RepRatcliffe, who got to the bottom of the FISAGATE & RUSSIAGATE HOAX. It makes a lot of sense to put John Ratcliffe in there (DNI).The Senate should quickly approve him. @DevinNunes @MariaBartiromo John will do a great job for the American people! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2020

Apparently the primary qualification for a nomination to become the nation’s lead intelligence official is not actual intelligence or experience, but a willingness to buy into whatever paranoid lunatic conspiracy theory the president is peddling on any given day.

Of course, a day cannot pass in the Bizzaro World universe of Trump’s Twitter posts without an attack on the media as an unreliable source of information since it is only the words that come from the mouth of the president himself that contain the “real” truth about what’s happening in the world and how it should be interpreted.

People are disgusted and embarrassed by the Fake News Media, as headed by the @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @comcast & MSDNC, @ABC, @CBSNews and more. They no longer believe what they see and read, and for good reason. Fake News is, indeed, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2020

Trump lists the most credible news sources in America and proceeds to gaslight the nation by describing them with a term much more suited as a description of his own actions since taking office as so many of his policies have demonstrated — THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!

Perfectly fulfilling the mission of dividing and weakening America that Russian President Vladimir Putin so presciently predicted that Trump would be able to efficiently accomplish when he threw the support of his hackers and propaganda machine behind the Republican candidate in the last presidential election, Trump continues to try to erode public trust in any news source besides what appears on his Twitter feed or his defacto state media arm, Fox News.

The realization that we still have a president in office who is this ignorant, vindictive, and malicious is an extremely depressing thought that can often remind one of the lyrics of the late Canadian singer/songwriter and poet Leonard Cohen in his song “Dress Rehearsal Rag”:

“That’s right, it’s come to this,

Yes it’s come to this,

And wasn’t it a long way down,

Wasn’t it a strange way down?”

At times like this, music can provide some solace, but the sad truth of Cohen’s lyrics won’t erase the reality that we must face and change as soon as we can in our efforts to get America back to being the land of the free and the home of the brave instead of the dystopian nightmare that Trump has rendered it.

Court smacks down Trump’s appointment of acting immigration chief Ken Cuccinelli as illegal,"Sponsored Links

A federal judge just ruled that Donald Trump’s appointment of Ken Cuccinelli — the controversial former Virginia Attorney General with ties to an anti-immigrant hate group and a reputation as a promoter of white nationalist, anti-LGBTQ, and misogynistic beliefs — as his acting Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was illegal, in another defeat for the president’s misguided anti-immigrant crusade before the courts.

U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss issued a 55-page decision that concluded that “Cuccinelli was not lawfully appointed to serve as the acting Director of USCIS” and, even more crucially, determined that the policies that the improperly appointed acting Director mandated regarding the treatment of asylum seekers “must be set aside.”

With Trump now regularly avoiding the constitutional requirement that his senior administration officials be confirmed by the Senate — despite the fact that the upper chamber of Congress is controlled by his fellow Republicans who have already demonstrated that they are too fearful of his vengeful wrath and potential primary challenges to dare defy his will — by appointing “acting” heads in key positions, Judge Moss’ decision was a strong message to the president that the constitutional requirement of “advice and consent” is not something that he is allowed to ignore.

In his opinion, Judge Moss wrote that Senate confirmation of senior executive branch office holders is “more than a matter of ‘etiquette or protocol’; it is among the significant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme.”

Trump has been rightfully criticized for picking his recent appointees more for their personal loyalty to himself than for any particular competency for the jobs to which he assigns them, as this recent tweet from the acting director in question in this case demonstrates.

While it’s likely that the Trump administration will appeal the ruling and ask for an emergency stay of the Judge’s order to rescind the directives made during Cuccinelli’s tenure to date, it’s encouraging that there are still a few judges left outside of the raft of politically-motivated new judges that Trump has nominated to the federal judiciary who are willing to maintain the rule of law in the face of the president’s constant assaults on precedent, proper procedure, and the Constitution.

"Trump fans flood Boston, screaming “virus is a hoax”","Sponsored Links

The zombie apocalypse is here.

Or at least its closest approximation: a hoard of right-wing media-brainwashed Trump supporters gathering at statehouses across the country demanding that governments re-open so they have the right to spread deadly viruses to anyone that they encounter.

Of course, they don’t frame their protests in quite those words despite the fact that that is essentially the upshot of their demands.

Boston is the latest city to be beset by these mindless promoters of the freedom to prolong the COVID-19 pandemic by prematurely ending lockdown restrictions and business closures, as hundreds of proto-zombies surrounded the Massachusetts State House for a so-called “Liberty Rally” organized by local right-wing radio provocateur Jeffrey Kuhner and the organizers of last September’s controversial Straight Pride Parade.

As described by The Boston Globe: “Demonstrators brandished American flags and Trump 2020 signs, along with signs that read ‘end the shutdown,’ ‘all jobs are essential,’ and ‘media is the virus.'”

Add your name to reject Trump & Republicans’ vile idea of sacrificing seniors’ lives to save the stock market!

Risking their lives for those essentials-for-life like frosted tips, root touch-ups, and cool new tattoos, protestors demonstrated their complete abandonment of rationality and science for a denial of reality that is tragically insulting to those who have lost loved ones already to the pandemic on a day after even their feckless leader revised his death estimates from the initial projections of nearly zero cases to the six-figure revised estimate that he floated at his town hall last night.

“I’m not going to sugar coat this, America is committing national suicide,” Kuhner told the crowd. “I see churches closed, I see an economic collapse, thousands of businesses bankrupt and shuttered — all of this for a lousy virus? For a contagious flu at the absolute worse? This is not a pandemic.”

Anyone dumb enough to take medical advice from a two-bit radio talk show charlatan who denies scientific consensus deserves to be called a zombie, among many other choice words, particularly when a majority of them were refusing to wear face coverings for their own safety and more importantly those of the poor innocents who don’t share their delusions.

“We should be able to decide whether or not we want to work, social distance, or wear a mask,” said a 61-year-old biker who rode to tke protest from Cape Cod . “I think people are going to get hooked on government pay — it is government overreach.”

It’s a shame no one bothered to ask him his position on abortion restrictions.

With Republican-controlled states already relaxing restrictions on businesses before meeting CDC guidelines on when it will be safe to do so, we can expect social Darwinism to cull the ranks of some of these misguided protestors. Unfortunately, it won’t be without collateral damage to others around them and to the long term prospects for their precious economy which will continue to flounder as a likely second wave of infections sweeps across the nation from a disease that has no proven cure, no vaccine, and a high rate of contagion and fatalities.

In the words of the late, great Afrobeat star Fela Kuti:

“Zombie no go go, unless you tell ’em to go (zombie)

Zombie no go stop, unless you tell ’em to stop (zombie)

Zombie no go turn, unless you tell ’em to turn (zombie)

Zombie no go think, unless you tell ’em to think (zombie)”

Kuti wrote that song in reference to the blind obedience of the police in his native Nigeria, but it applies equally to the blindly sheep-like protestors who decry the “lies” of the mainstream media and scientific experts, all while swallowing whole the evil and dangerous propaganda fed to them by self-interested right-wing media.

Don’t be a zombie. Stay home. Stay safe. Wear a mask when you absolutely have to go out in public.

And let your legislators know that they should keep restrictions in place until the science says it’s safe to loosen them.

You can see some photos from the “Liberty Rally” in Boston in the tweets attached below.

Remember to check the COVID-19 statistics in Massachusetts in about 14 days to see the results of their maskless protests.
