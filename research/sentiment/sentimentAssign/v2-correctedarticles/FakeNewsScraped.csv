"VACCINE SLAUGHTER: An estimated 500,000 sharks will have to be killed and harvested to create a coronavirus vaccine","(Natural News) In the rush to create a vaccine for covid-19, scientists will need at least 500,000 dead sharks over the next six months. The sharks will be slaughtered to provide vaccine makers with an oil called squalene. The squalene is a byproduct produced in the liver of sharks. Smaller amounts of squalene can be found in olive oil, palm oil, wheat-germ oil, amaranth oil and rice bran oil, but these aren’t reliable sources for wide scale vaccine production.

In vaccine science, squalene is combined with surfactant chemicals to create an adjuvant which is used to augment an immune response in vaccine recipients. Based on its chemical properties, squalene is an emollient, allowing for vaccine antigens and other chemicals to more readily absorb deep into tissues and cells.

The more potent an adjuvant is, the greater the chances that the vaccine antigen (attenuated virus) penetrates the immune system, generating an antibody response in serum. As the potency of the adjuvant is increased, so is the risk of vaccine injury. As the potency of the adjuvant is decreased, the effectiveness of the vaccine wanes, requiring more doses to simulate an immune response.

Moreover, the human immune system is prone to produce antibodies to squalene — an under-studied autoimmune effect that could have lasting effects on humans. Even though squalene is a “cleaner” adjuvant than aluminum salts, it is part of scientific process that bypasses the innate immune system, including surveillance proteins, surveillance microbes, mucous membranes, etc.

As vaccine dependency increases, shark populations suffer

The mass slaughter of sharks is nothing new; certain types of influenza and malaria vaccines already depend upon squalene harvesting from sharks. As public health officials plan for wide-scale vaccination worldwide, the demand for dead sharks will grow exponentially.

The new covid-19 vaccines will not be effective after the first dose. The first experimental protocol requires two doses of the vaccine to simulate any sort of antibody response in humans. As this antibody response wanes, more doses will be needed in order to augment an immune response in humans. Some clinical trials suggest that five to six doses will be needed to keep human antibody levels up. This level of vaccine dependence could drastically affect the shark population.

Conservationist group, Shark Allies estimates that 250,000 sharks will need to be slaughtered in order for one vaccine dose to be distributed to the world’s population. If multiple doses are required, as evidenced by waning antibody responses in clinical trials, then millions of sharks would need to be slaughtered over the next three years.

Shark Allies founder Stefanie Brendl has launched a petition, demanding an end to the use of squalene in vaccines. She wrote: “Harvesting something from a wild animal is never going to be sustainable, especially if it’s a top predator that doesn’t reproduce in huge numbers. There’s so many unknowns of how big and how long this pandemic might go on, and then how many versions of it we have to go through, that if we continue using sharks, the numbers of sharks taken for this product could be really high, year after year after year.”

Vaccine production could ultimately endanger shark populations, only to make human immune systems dependent on vaccine science that wanes over time and puts additional pressure on the oceanic ecosystem.

"Moderna coronavirus vaccine causes side effects in over 50% of patients; antibodies disappear in 2-3 months, rendering the vaccine pointless","(Natural News) The widely-hyped Moderna coronavirus vaccine caused adverse events (side effects) in over 50% of clinical trial participants, including, “fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site.” While it generates antibodies in the short term, new studies indicate those antibodies fade very quickly, rendering the vaccine pointless in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

The side effects of the Moderna mRNA vaccine are documented in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a discredited, pro-pharma junk science rag that lies in favor of Big Pharma in every way possible. As published on Medicine.news, the NEJM was recently caught up with The Lancet in a junk science scheme that sought to discredit hydroxychloroquine through the use of fabricated data that was published in both journals (then was later retracted).

The new study is entitled, “An mRNA Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 — Preliminary Report.” It details the astonishing degree of side effects experienced by study subjects, revealing that over half of study participants reported at least one side effect. This chart, from the study, also shows that the side effects are dose dependent, meaning the higher the injection dose, the higher the reported side effects, further strengthening the causal ties between the vaccine and the side effects:

As you can see from the chart, 100% of study participants experienced side effects at the 100 ug or 250 ug injection volumes, during the second round of vaccination.

100% of study participants experienced side effects in the high-dose second round of vaccination

Notably, 100% of participants experienced headaches, local symptoms and systemic symptoms, while nearly 100% experienced chills, myalgia and fatigue, during the second injections.

This study reveals that the vaccine becomes increasingly toxic with subsequent injections, meaning even if the fist injection is relatively well handled by the body, the second injection can be significantly more dangerous.

Notably, with other studies now revealing that coronavirus antibodies fade quickly over the period of about 3 months, the mRNA vaccine from Moderna would have to be injected multiple times, perhaps as many as four times each year in order to maintain high levels of antibodies.

But with each injection, the vaccine becomes more toxic and produces more side effects. As the study authors conclude, “Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose…”

Even with side effects impacting all participants in the second round, study authors claim everything’s fine

Yet, to no one’s surprise, all these toxic effects of the vaccine that increase with subsequent vaccines are not called out as an item of concern. Given that the study authors are, of course, paid by Moderna to produce pro-vaccine propaganda in the name of “science,” they conclude that all the side effects are perfectly fine, stating: (emphasis added)

Across both vaccinations, solicited systemic and local adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Evaluation of safety clinical laboratory values of grade 2 or higher and unsolicited adverse events revealed no patterns of concern… These safety and immunogenicity findings support advancement of the mRNA-1273 vaccine to later-stage clinical trials.



Got that? The vaccine is increasingly toxic in higher doses and multiple injections, but it’s still awesome and should move toward production and widespread injections into potentially billions of human beings, despite no long-term safety studies being conducted whatsoever.

That’s the vaccine industry in 2020: Screw safety and science, just approve the damn thing and collect the hundreds of billions of dollars from governments buying your vaccine, even if it harms or kills millions of people.

Even when the vaccine invokes an antibody response, that’s not “immunity”

Note that the production of antibodies in the blood is not the same as “functional immunity.” There is zero evidence that this vaccine makes anyone immune to coronavirus infections.

And as Michael Snyder writes on EndOfTheAmericanDream.com, three studies have now found covid-19 antibodies disappear from the body very quickly, rendering antibody-producing vaccines practically worthless:

Scientific evidence continues to emerge that indicates that COVID-19 is going to be with us for a very long time to come. Yesterday, I reported on a recent study that was conducted in China and another recent study that was conducted in Spain that both showed that COVID-19 antibodies start to disappear very, very quickly. In fact, the study that was conducted in Spain discovered that some patients that originally tested positive for antibodies “no longer had antibodies weeks later”. Well, now we have a third study to add to the list. A study of COVID-19 patients that was conducted at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust in London found that “just 16.7 percent of the patients had a potent antibody response” after a couple of months had passed…

Researchers analyzed immune responses of patients and health care workers at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust in London and found that levels of antibodies that destroy the virus quickly declined after peaking several weeks after patients exhibited symptoms.

The study found that 60 percent of the patients had a “potent” antibody response at peak of their battle with the coronavirus. After about two months, however, just 16.7 percent of the patients had a potent antibody response.

As Snyder points out, this is a huge finding because it means that coronavirus vaccines will likely only work short-term. After perhaps 90 days or so, the vaccine “wears off” and the antibodies are no longer functional in the body. Even the presence of antibodies doesn’t automatically confer immunity, by the way. Again, from Snyder:

In addition, experts are telling us that even if a COVID-19 victim develops antibodies, that does not necessarily mean that individual has immunity. In an article that he authored for CNN, Dr. William Haseltine explained that “only 15% of those who test positive for antibodies make the neutralizing antibodies necessary to develop immunity”…

Not only do antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 fade, and perhaps fade quickly, studies have also shown that only 15% of those who test positive for antibodies make the neutralizing antibodies necessary to develop immunity in the first place. And not all of those who make neutralizing antibodies make them at high levels. Some of those infected make no antibodies at all.

In other words, even if the mRNA vaccine from Moderna produces antibodies, the whole exercise may be pointless for two reasons:

1) Antibodies alone don’t confer immunity.

2) Antibodies fade away in just a few weeks.

Thus, the Moderna vaccine — which the Big Pharma pimping mainstream media has been hyping up as the savior of humanity — is probably a massive medical hoax that will scam world governments out of hundreds of billions of dollars for a treatment that flat-out doesn’t work.

Worse than a hoax, this vaccine will clearly harm large numbers of people, given that 100% of study subjects are already experiencing adverse events in the high dose group, during the second round of injections. How toxic is this going to get during a third vaccine? Or a fourth? And is there any end to how many injections of the same vaccine will be mandated by a corrupt, criminal FDA, CDC and national media that makes all its editorial decisions based on the profit demands of the drug cartels?

Finally, keep in mind that globalists who also promote the depopulation agenda are demanding this vaccine be given to Black people first. So wait: Take a toxic vaccine that doesn’t work but that causes huge side effects, and line up all the Blacks to be human guinea pigs?

Sounds like globalists and the vaccine industry have a whole new plan for planet Earth beyond 2020, and it has nothing to do with halting the pandemic but everything to do with genocide.

Don’t you find it astonishing that while hundreds of U.S. corporations are lining up to claim “Black Lives Matter,” many of those very same corporations are the ones producing the vaccines that will no doubt destroy Black lives?",7/16/20 0:00,,0
RIGGED: Covid-19 testing kits were distributed years before pandemic was declared,"(Natural News) What motivated the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic at the time they did? How much of the pandemonium, governments’ lock downs and corporate control is an overreaction? How much of it was planned? Whose agendas do these lock downs and economic controls ultimately serve? Did you know that covid-19 testing kits were distributed before the pandemic was declared?

A group of 600 medical doctors gathered in Spain and called the covid-19 outbreak “a false pandemic” created for political purposes. Locking people down and convincing them they can spread infections they do not have is a tyrannical curse of oppression. These doctors urge other healthcare professionals, “the media and political authorities to stop this criminal operation, by spreading the truth.”

Why are human rights being challenged during a time of human need?

In September 2019, the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board released a report titled, ‘A World at Risk’ which detailed how the UN and WHO conduct system-wide training and simulation exercises, including one for covering the deliberate release of a “lethal respiratory pathogen.” Why did Dr. Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates go on record about an impending pandemic, long before one was declared? Why are both these men so adamant about vaccinating the world population?

Why are medical edicts being enacted with such punitive force and why is the public health response so focused on restricting personal liberty and controlling economic activity, in mere anticipation of infectious disease? Why is the state taking away personal rights, medical privacy and forcing PPE onto populations through fear and coercion? In October 2019, Bill Gates organized a coronavirus pandemic exercise in New York called Event201. The event focused on how everyone on the planet should be vaccinated. In order to achieve this goal, the population would have need to be conditioned to surrender their rights for the “good of all.”

Covid-19 testing kits distributed in 2017 and 2018

Are covid-19 testing kits strategically designed to produce false positives, to overstate the number of cases to justify government intervention and isolation of healthy people? The CDC owns not only the patent on the coronavirus but also a patent and exclusive rights to the testing methodology. Why are the covid-19 testing kits producing false positives in those who are not sick, producing false evidence to force quarantines on healthy people and to declare outbreaks that aren’t even real? Why is the medical fraud allowed to persist?

If covid-19 appeared in China late 2019, why were covid-19 test kits distributed worldwide, two years before the “pandemic?” The World Integrated Trade Solution database reveals that covid-19 test kits were sent to countries in 2017 and 2018.

After this trade information went viral, the World Integrated Trade Solution tried to relabel “covid-19” with an inconspicuous term, “Medical Test Kits.” In the world of trade, this level of vagueness is not permitted. Even though WITS tried to cover up the label, they cannot change the product code. “Medical Test Kits” has the same product code, HS 300215 and it stands for “Covid-19 test kits.”

Why has so much focus been put on faulty detection protocols while effective treatments for covid-19 respiratory illness is suppressed? Why are hospital systems so ill-equipped to help patient immune systems? Why are these questions not even allowed on social media, as Facebook unites with the scientific dictatorship known as the WHO and the CDC to control information?

Same adjuvant in swine flu vaccine that caused narcolepsy also being used in coronavirus vaccine,"(Natural News) Numerous drug giants, including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi, are busily working to develop new vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). And we have learned that an adjuvant created by GSK that was linked to causing narcolepsy during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic is also slated to be used in these upcoming Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines.

Known as ASO3, this adjuvant is part of a proprietary prophylactic technology developed by GSK in partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, that helps to make it easier for vaccine companies to roll out new vaccines in response to pandemics like the one currently said to be responsible for widespread lockdowns.

Back in February, CEPI announced that it had coordinated an agreement with The University of Queensland in Australia to begin incorporating GSK’s adjuvant technology into rapid vaccine production systems. And here we are almost six months later and that technology is about to be inserted into new Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines being developed by GSK and Sanofi, and potentially others.

“In theory, the adjuvant should cut the amount of antigen that is needed to create effective vaccines,” reported Fierce Biotech several months back. “That benefit, known as antigen sparing, is particularly sought after during pandemic outbreaks as it enables more people to be vaccinated using available antigen supplies.”

In other words, GSK’s adjuvant technology will allow technocrat eugenicists like Bill Gates the ability to rapidly roll out new vaccines much more quickly than normal, which is arriving just in time for President Donald Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” vaccine program for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

GSK says don’t worry about the safety and effectiveness of future coronavirus vaccines – it’s all good!

As for ASO3, this squalene-containing adjuvant, which also contains DL-?-tocopherol and polysorbate, was first used more than a decade ago in the swine flu vaccine to facilitate the rapid rollout of millions of new jabs. And before long, people who received the shot started to develop narcolepsy, sparking global concern about the vaccine’s safety.

Fast-forward to today and this vaccine, known as Pandemrix, is still the subject of considerable controversy over the untold number of lives that were harmed or killed by its use. While GSK claims that ASO3 is not to blame for these cases, the situation is still “unresolved,” according to reports.

“GSK, for its part, thinks the pros and cons support the use of the adjuvant, noting that assessments of Pandemrix gave it a positive risk-benefit profile and that there are reasons to think the risks are far lower with 2019-nCOV,” Fierce Pharma further reports.

“Though research remains ongoing, currently available scientific data suggests that the occurrence of narcolepsy in the context of the 2009/10 Flu pandemic was associated with a similarity between a protein in the wild type H1N1 virus and a human protein relevant in regulating the sleep cycle, an extremely rare coincidence. Because the similarity was specific to the wild type H1N1 Flu virus, it is unlikely to affect the potential development and use of future 2019-nCOV pandemic vaccine candidates,” a GSK spokesperson is quoted as saying.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that ASO3 was only used for the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and has not been used since. Should it end up appearing in the new Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, which appears probable, be on the lookout for a potential wave of deadly side effects, as well as deaths, stemming from its use.

Shocking numbers: Comparing COVID-19 deaths to abortion deaths,"(Natural News) I recently saw the headline from the New York Times about the deaths of over 200,000 Americans to COVID-19, and it got me thinking.

(Article by Katie Beatty republished from LifeSiteNews.com)

What does that number represent? How does this number relate to the number of abortions committed in the U.S. every year?

What I found was shocking, sobering, and heartbreaking.

My bachelor’s degree is in mathematics, so my automatic response was to begin crunching numbers. In 2018, a total of 2,839,205 resident deaths were registered in the United States according to the CDC website.

The current population of the United States is approximately 330,484,275 and climbing. One person is born every eight seconds, and one person dies every twelve seconds.[1] So what is the average number of deaths from COVID-19 following this model? As of the week of 10/17/2020, there were 208,633 deaths between February 1, 2020 and October 17, 2020 related to COVID. In order to get an accurate average, we have to take the total number of days. Adding up the total:

So then we have

Truly a tragedy and a sad loss of life.

But wait — what about the babies who are aborted and are not included in the 7,779 deaths per day figure?

The last recorded number that I could find for abortions is from 2016, where 623,471 abortions were reported in the United States. The estimation for the actual number of abortions in 2016 is 862,320.

That means that the number of babies who are aborted in the United States each day is almost triple the number of people who die daily with COVID-19.

Abortion has been legal, however, since the 1973 decisions of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, and COVID-19 has been around only since December. What do the other numbers look like? How many Americans have we lost already to this tragedy? How many empty seats are there at the dinner table because your son or daughter or brother or sister was aborted?

Currently, abortion in the United States is on a downward trend with the peak of the crises occurring in 1990. The number of live births is also trending downward. This does not mean that the number of daily abortions is insignificant. In 2017, 18% of pregnancies ended by abortion — in other words, 1 out of every 6 pregnancies.

But let’s look a little closer.

I compiled the number of registered births between 1973 and 2016, the reported number of abortions per year, and the number of estimated abortions provided by the Guttmacher institute.[2]

Total Number of Live Births Total Number of Reported Abortions Total Estimated Number of Abortions 169,287,799 45,269,156 57,368,870

169 million live births. 57 million abortions. An entire generation…gone.

Let’s find out what that actually means. Once numbers get into the millions, people start to get confused. Just looking at the congressional budget verifies that statement. In order to find the percentage, first, we need to figure out the potential number of live births. I found this number by adding the total number of estimated abortions to the total number of live births.

Next we find the percentage of abortions to that potential number of live births through division and multiplication.

Twenty-five percent of the population that was supposed to be born in the last 40 years has been aborted? Do you mean to tell me that for every three babies born alive, one was aborted?

This is madness. Insanity. This is wrong.

It doesn’t end there. The highest recorded number of deaths in one day because of the coronavirus was 2,909 people. The most abortions performed in the United States in one year occurred in 1990, when 1,609,000 children are estimated to have been aborted.

In abortion’s heyday, over 4,000 American children were aborted every day. That is one child every 20 seconds. Three children every minute. The COVID-19 peak comes from one single day, but this is 4,408 babies, every day, for 365 days.

It continues. In 1980, the ratio of estimated abortions to live births was 43%!

That’s almost half of all pregnancies! That is absolute craziness!

You can argue to me about fetal viability; your body, your choice; and how a majority of abortions performed are done through medication and in the first 12 weeks until you are blue in the face, but at the end of the day, you will still be wrong if you defend abortion. Every person has a unique genetic code from the moment of conception and is a unique person with rights, born or unborn.

Two hundred eight thousand six hundred thirty-three COVID deaths to 57,368,870 abortions is not even half a percentage point. So yes, our great nation is in a crisis. But the crisis is not COVID-19; it is abortion.

On this upcoming Election Day on November 3, remember what really matters. All of the people who have tragically lost their lives and their futures to abortion. All of the unique, unrepeatable gifts to society that will never be.

After all, there is a reason why the right to life comes first in the Declaration of Independence. If we do not have the right to life, all of our other rights don’t matter.

This Election Day, you cannot support Biden/Harris and the ticket of death who want to allow abortions up to the moment of birth because you will be complicit in the greatest injustice of our time. The loss of life that occurs each and every day because of abortion carries more weight than any other issue on the table and is truly the greatest tragedy of our time.

Finally, if you have had an abortion, there may be unresolved feelings. Please know that you are not alone. There are programs, like Project Rachel, all over the country that help women struggling with emotional problems after abortion.

NO SURPRISE: The five deadliest COVID districts in the U.S. are ‘represented’ by Democrats… and AOC’s is the WORST,"(Natural News) Democratic lawmakers and Democratic ‘leaders’ around the country have become the most vocal in criticizing President Donald Trump and his administration for the administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This virus has become the most politicized outbreak in the history of our country, and that is due in no small part to the garbage ‘mainstream’ media in our country — most of whom are nothing more than left-wing propagandists and hacks whose entire existence in the age of Trump is to destroy his presidency, no matter if the country goes down with him.

Because it’s become so politicized and because the media hasn’t reported on it honestly, Americans have no clue what to believe about it.

But here’s one thing that is absolutely true: Democrats are the most responsible for the proliferation of the virus and the resultant tanking of the economy because they are the ones keeping it down and keeping Americans in doubt about ‘the science’ surrounding the virus.

Oh, and one other thing: The party that most blames President Trump for the deaths as a result of the virus (the death toll has also been politicized, by the way) represents portions of the country where the most deaths have occurred. (Related: US reports first case of COVID-19 reinfection.)

The Western Journal reports:

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez likes criticizing Republicans, particularly President Donald Trump, over their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Oct. 6, for instance, AOC criticized Trump for advising Republicans to hold off on negotiating a COVID-19 relief package until after the presidential election, given House Leader Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats’ radical partisanship during stimulus negotiations.

“What an anti-everybody agenda looks like,” the New York Democrat tweeted Oct. 6.

What an anti-everybody agenda looks like: The President & GOP are walking away from getting ANY COVID stimulus relief done, effectively endangering millions, after *they* themselves got COVID & enjoyed free socialized healthcare, so they can push through an anti-ACA SCOTUS pick. https://t.co/zIidL1d6Rr — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 6, 2020

“The President & GOP are walking away from getting ANY COVID stimulus relief done, effectively endangering millions, after *they* themselves got COVID & enjoyed free socialized healthcare, so they can push through an anti-ACA SCOTUS pick.”

Yes, well…now, onto some facts.

According to Harvard University’s COVID-19 Metrics for United States Congressional Districts project, the districts with the highest number of coronavirus deaths as of the end of September all are represented by Democrats:

5. New York’s 5th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks (in office since 1998): 2.60 confirmed COVID deaths per 1,000 residents.

4. New York’s 9th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. Yvette Clark (in office since 2007): 2.63 confirmed COVID deaths per 1,000 people.

3. New York’s 6th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. Grace Meng (in office since 2013): 2.90 confirmed COVID deaths per 1,000 people.

2. New York’s 15th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. José Serrano (in office since 1991): 3.08 confirmed COVID deaths per 1,000 people.

1. New York’s 14th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (in office since 2019): 3.09 confirmed COVID deaths per 1,000 people.

Now, it should be said that U.S. representatives are elected by district residents to go to Washington, D.C., and be their voice in Congress. They don’t run the individual districts; elected local and state leaders do.

Therefore, it would be more appropriate to cast aspersions for the high death rate — the No. 1 rate — for her district on New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats.

Or no one because it’s a virus and viruses spread. They just do.

But still, it’s “ridiculous” for the New York freshman lawmaker “to be lobbing grenades at anyone else” over their response to the pandemic, said The Western Journal’s editor-in-chief George Upper.

“Just as I would say that I don’t think Donald Trump has a heck of a lot to do with how many people are dying from COVID,” Upper said last week on “WJ Live,” the Journal’s new podcast, “I wouldn’t hold a representative responsible for that.”

“For AOC to be lobbing grenades at anyone else when that’s what her home district looks like is just ridiculous,” he said.

“The narrative on the left is that politicians are responsible for it as long as the politicians are Donald Trump. That’s the narrative from the left. It’s ridiculous,” he added.

Fact check: True.

"BOMBSHELL: Covid-19 isn’t a pandemic plan, it’s an EXTERMINATION plan for humanity","(Natural News) About a year ago, I gave a live presentation in Branson, Missouri, that is only now being made fully public. The presentation, shown below via Brighteon.com, reveals that the real master plan which led to COVID is actually an extermination plan for humanity.

Population reduction has been the goal all along. But where the globalists have shown their true evil genius is in their choice of creating a biological weapon with high transmission rather than high fatality rates. The virus was never very deadly to people under the age of 50, but it was always highly contagious to people of all ages. And that contagiousness, it turns out, was enough to advance their nefarious plan against humanity.

The rapid spread of the virus allowed the globalist-controlled media to claim “cases” were skyrocketing, thereby justifying weaponized lockdowns and a global rolling out of medical fascism disguised as “public health” policies. Based entirely on the speed of the spread of the virus, cities, states and nations of the world were able to achieve three key goals that represent the necessary precursors to global human extermination:

Crushing the existing human economies of the world, including food production, ultimately leading to mass famine, homelessness and total dependence on government. Rolling out new, Orwellian medical fascism laws and edicts that set the precedent for mass arrests and forced relocation into “quarantine camps” for those who resist. These camps, of course, are actually death camps and processing facilities for eliminating human beings. Forcing compliance with global vaccine mandates which will of course be used to achieve global infertility and accelerated deaths from diseases and subsequent infections. Whereas a pathogen could not achieve a 90% death rate on its own, the engineered pathogen (the Wuhan coronavirus) was able to be used to drive people into mass vaccine compliance, during which they can be directly injected with toxic substances, vaccine compliance tracking nanotech (quantum dots) and biology-altering mRNA sequences that literally hijack the body’s cells and reprogram them to produce whatever protein sequences are engineered into the mRNA vaccines.

Thus, globalists have simultaneously built a global pandemic prison camp combined with a mandatory vaccine obedience system through which they can repeatedly spread more infectious disease and promote accelerated deaths or infertility.

The end goal, as globalists like Bill Gates openly support, is the elimination of billions of human beings living today. Ideally, globalists seek to reduce the world population to about 500 million people, which is roughly a 94% reduction in the current human population.

The world you once knew is never coming back, because the globalists who run the world have other plans

Each day, more and more people are coming to realize that there will be no restoration of the world we all once knew. Globalists have no intention of restoring human freedom, economic prosperity and global mobility. Now, human societies are being deliberately crushed — even in the face of contradictory scientific evidence that shows lockdowns don’t work — in order to cause mass destitution and collapse.

Only through this planned collapse can the billions of people in the world be forced into subservience to the globalist depopulation agenda.

A key element of this is the Universal Basic Income (UBI), which has already been rolled out across America for the last several months, under the approval of Republicans, Democrats and President Trump. The UBI provides basic sustenance income to allow people to purchase food and stay alive, while CDC mandates prohibit the eviction of renters who can no longer pay rent. Through the UBI, the eviction ban and the pumping up of the stock market with Fed money printing policies, America remains under the false appearance that the economy is rebounding. In truth, these are all temporary, makeshift tactics to prevent millions of homeless from spilling out into the streets right before an election.

The real plan — about to be rolled out — is to tie UBI benefits to vaccine compliance and speech compliance. Only the obedient will be granted government credits for food, and anyone who refuses to take the new vaccine will be cut off from government benefits. This is a deliberate “squeeze” to force the sheeple into mass vaccine suicide by making sure they cannot function in society (or receive government benefits) unless they go along with the vaccine mandates, which are of course a global extermination program disguised as a public health program.

How vaccines will be used to exterminate billions of humans while amplifying infectious disease on a global scale

The mass extermination via vaccines consists of two strategies:

Lacing the vaccines with new bioweapons viral strains to ensure the continuation of the “outbreak” narrative. Notably, this only requires less than one percent of administered vaccines to be laced. Engineering the vaccines to cause a very high fatality rate upon exposure to a secondary future infection, in a fatal reaction called a “cytokine storm,” which is a hyper-inflammation event that leads to rapid death.

Thus, people won’t be dropping dead right away after taking the vaccines. Instead, they will seem fine until the next major bioweapon pandemic hits them, at which point the fatality rate will be extremely high (perhaps as high as 75% averaged across all age groups).

The next strain to be released via the vaccines will be COVID-21, and the COVID-21 strain could be rightly considered the second half of a binary weapon system that will achieve extremely high kill rates for human beings across the globe.

Importantly, the mass die-offs will further justify government lockdowns, quarantines and medical authoritarianism that grants governments the power to forcefully inject people, kidnap people, imprison people and even exterminate people at will. The mass hysteria from the sudden wave of deaths will also feed directly into the justification of increased censorship by the tech giants, which will de-platform anyone who discusses the truth about how this entire scheme was planned from the start.

What ends up being created is a feedback loop of death, hysteria and tyranny. The more people die, the more hysteria the media spreads and the more tyranny is justified by the state. This, in turn, results in higher numbers of vaccine injections, which spread more weaponized viral strains, resulting in another wave of hysteria and so on. It’s the perfect scam of tyranny and depopulation: The very governments who are building the bioweapons are using them to exterminate the masses while using the infections to justify their own power to administer the extermination weapons (i.e. vaccines).

Government tyrants are giggling with joy with their newfound powers over life and death

YouTube has just recently confirmed it will ban all vaccine videos that don’t toe the line of Big Pharma and the China-run WHO. We’ve all witnessed the accelerating purges of so-called “anti-vax” channels and speakers across all the major tech platforms. It’s all part of the narrative control that will maintain information monopolies to keep pushing the vaccines, lockdowns and tyranny that’s killing human beings by the billions.

This is how they pull it off! It’s not the pandemic that’s really killing people; it’s the governments. And any who don’t surrender to the tyranny will be singled out as “threats” to public health, then silenced or forcibly removed.

Victoria, Australia has already beta tested these programs and has found a shocking degree of compliance among the population that’s targeted for extermination. New Zealand has also discovered shockingly high levels of compliance, and Canada is finding much the same thing. As it turns out, “progressive” societies are filled with eager-to-obey sheeple who maintain irrational faith and trust in government — the very same government that’s preparing them all to be terminated.

Resistance groups are growing all around the world, including in America where local economies (in conservative states) have fared relatively well by avoiding the punitive lockdowns that now characterize left-leaning cities and states.

This is the reason the globalists are working desperately to remove President Trump from power: Trump and his followers are the last remaining defenses for humanity, standing up against the anti-human forces of tyranny and destruction that built the coronavirus bioweapon in the first place (and released it on purpose, then lied about it). Thus, Trump must be removed from power at all costs, and his followers and supporters must be silenced, criminalized, smeared and eliminated at all costs as well. No pro-human voice that resists the COVID-21 tyranny scheme may be allowed to exist, or the entire plan could be placed in jeopardy because it requires broad voluntary compliance of the sheeple who are being culled. The minute the sheeple wake up and realize they are being led to the slaughter, they might not follow orders so easily.

How billions of humans will line up and beg to be “suicided” with vaccines

Rational people can process most of what I’ve described above, if they do the research and aren’t brain damaged from fluoride, pesticides, heavy metals and 5G. But now we bring in a topic where many people just can’t fathom the reality: Earth’s globalists are following orders from non-human entities.

Different people describe these non-human, non-Earth entities in different ways. To some people, they are demons of supernatural origin. To others, they are aliens of extraterrestrial origin. Still others say they are AI systems from advanced civilizations across the cosmos, and another explanation describes these influencing entities as interdimensional beings from a parallel universe. (Interesting note: CERN scientists have announced they are preparing to power up CERN to literally “make contact with a parallel universe,” according to mainstream media headlines.)

Whatever you call it, there exist non-human influences that seek to utterly eliminate the human race and cleanse planet Earth of humans. By some accounts, globalists have even been handed exotic technologies — such as genetic engineering tech, nanotech or anti-matter energy tech — to help achieve these goals in an efficient manner.

In essence, globalists have been commanded to eliminate most human beings in the most efficient manner possible, and it turns out that the most efficient way to achieve that is to convince humans to commit medical suicide. (i.e. line up and beg for vaccines). It’s actually much more work to try to exterminate human beings by force, because they will resist with force. But if you can roll out a global pandemic, crush the world’s economies, enslave the people while driving them all bankrupt and then demand their obedience to a medical police state, those very same people you are trying to eliminate will line up and beg to be “suicided” with vaccines.

And that’s precisely how this is being accomplished. Under the Trump administration, this program is called “Operation Warp Speed,” but Trump himself isn’t on board with the final solution, we believe. Rather, he’s playing along for other reasons, such as using the operation to strategically place military personnel in cities across America in preparation for a possible civil war uprising by Leftists.

But even the name “Operation Warp Speed” should be a red flag. Translated into the real goals of the globalists, it would be called Operation Fast Kill.

Why kill off human with vaccines when nuclear weapons would be so much faster? Answer: Organism specificity

You might wonder why the anti-human forces don’t simply nuke the planet and eliminate humans that way. The answer is because Earth’s ecosystem has value to all intelligent entities, and they do not seek the ruination of this planet; merely the elimination of the humans who inhabit it. Whatever weapon they use must be deployed with organism specificity so that it kills only humans, not apes, monkeys or other non-human primates, nor other mammals.

This is why genetically engineered vaccines are the ideal weapon for the extermination of humanity: They are very specific to human beings and pose essentially no risk of harm to the larger biosphere.

The point is to kill humans before humans kill the biosphere

In terms of motivations for all this, many believe this effort is also aligned with the idea that humans are in the process of destroying Earth’s biosphere — via pollution, radiation, microplastics, ecological destruction, etc. — and that if humans aren’t eliminated, the planet will reach a tipping point and find itself plunged into a mass extinction event which might require millions of years of recovery time.

This argument has nothing to do with the hoax of “climate change,” but rather centers on the mass chemical pollution and ecological destruction that humans continue to unleash across the planet, with complete disregard for the long-term effects of such actions.

From the point of view of non-humans, humans have become a cancer to Earth, and healing the Earth will require removing that cancer (i.e. human beings).

In summary so far:

Non-human entities have ordered globalists to engineer a scheme in which billions of humans can be eliminated without much of a fight.

The Wuhan coronavirus was engineered and released to stir up mass media hysteria in order to justify the deployment of medical police state policies around the globe.

Human economies were deliberately crushed in order to obliterate economic abundance and make most humans economic slaves (refugees) dependent on government, taking away their individual liberties or economic options.

Governments will only pay benefits to those who agree to line up and get vaccinated with the “kill switch” vaccines.

The deaths won’t occur immediately, but upon exposure to the next pathogen being released in the binary weapon depopulation scheme.

Once the great masses of human sheeple have been culled, the non-human entities can engage the remaining human resistance forces and eliminate them in a mop-up operation, preparing planet Earth for post-human colonization and other applications. Those human globalists who aided in the extermination agenda will of course be betrayed and eliminated themselves. Bill Gates, in other words, will eventually wind up with his own head on a stick, too.

Watch the Oblivion Agenda lecture series to get the full explanation in great detail

In the following 4-part lecture, I reveal why Earth has cosmic real estate value that’s recognized by all intelligent civilizations, and why Faster-Than-Light (FTL) travel technology is ubiquitous across the cosmos. Earth’s location in the Milky Way galaxy puts it right in the thick of traffic from other civilizations, who have obviously watched the rise of Homo Sapiens and have no doubt sounded alarm bells over the nuclear weapons testing that humans have been carrying out since 1945.

Setting off nukes on your own planet, by the way, is sort of a cosmic-scale way to announce to the universe, “We are here, and we are infinitely stupid. Someone please stop us before we destroy everything within reach.”

Even aliens, you see, can’t change the laws of physics. Radioisotopic half-lives are the same, everywhere in the cosmos, and they can’t be altered when anything short of nuclear fusion or fission reactors. Once you contaminate a planet with radiation, that planet is a biohazard for millennia, if not longer, and this holds true no matter what life form you might have in mind for occupying that planet.

Thus, with humanity’s mass pollution of the oceans due to microplastics, combined with the Fukushima disaster and the impending structural collapse of the Three Gorges Dam which will unleash a wave of nuclear accidents that poison most of the Northern Hemisphere, observers who have been watching Earth have reached what they see as the point of necessary interventions to save Earth from humanity. It appears they have made the decision to initiate the extermination of humans.

Biological weapons use human tissue to replicate the weapon itself, allow the weapon to be race-specific and to focus its second wave of binary death on the most highly-populated areas (cities). It is no coincidence that cities are where lockdowns and vaccine compliance programs are being most aggressively announced as well. This is where mass compliance can achieve the most efficient mass exterminations in the years ahead.

How political upheaval and civil war play right into the mass extermination agenda

Within this framework of the mass extermination of humans, any geopolitical wars or civil wars that can accelerate economic destruction and the collapse of public health are viewed as aiding the larger goal of global extermination. Notably, nuclear weapons will not be allowed to be deployed for the reasons stated above (i.e. the pollution is impossible to reverse). They can, instead, be decommissioned after launch via exotic non-Earth tech which has already been deployed against ICBM tests.

But conventional, kinetic wars between nations will be encouraged, as will domestic wars. Anything that promotes chaos, death, economic destruction and the collapse of health infrastructure is seen as accelerating the end goal of global depopulation.

Part of the mass mind control of humans is to keep people focused on small, tribal differences (Republicans vs. Democrats, Black vs. White or China vs. the USA) rather than realizing all humans have been targeted for extermination, and that we all share a common enemy which is not of this Earth.

In less than 10,000 years, humans went from innocent, indigenous dwellers to insane, destructive, technocrats who threaten not just Earth, but every planet we can reach. As we stand on the cusp of interplanetary travel and colonization, it seems that our cosmic neighbors have decided that humans are a threat to the cosmos and must not be allowed to continue to exist.

Ending humanity, they believe, is necessary to save Earth. And this is the plan you are seeing rolled out right now.

Last year, I called this cosmic plan the Oblivion Agenda. I’ve even posted more podcasts and videos about all this at the website OblivionAgenda.com.

Here are the videos from the Branson lecture in 2019, during which I presented this to the world. I held them back for the last six months or so, believing most of humanity wasn’t ready to handle this information. I’m hoping that now, after the covid-19 wake up call for humanity, the human race might be ready to learn the truth and hear this information.

"Major lawsuits coming for political tyrants who used coronavirus to steal freedom, destroy lives","(Natural News) With regards to the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), President Trump has repeatedly warned against a “cure” that is worse than the “disease.” And now that “cure” is the subject of new litigation that seeks justice against the political tyrants who told us all that we had to hole up at home in a mask in order to “flatten the curve.”

The Außerparlamentarischer Corona Untersuchungsausschuss (ACU), also known as the “Corona Extra-Parliamentary Inquiry Committee,” is a German group leading the charge to sue the pants off of every politician and government official out there who decided it would be a good idea to force everyone to stay home for months on end, which destroyed many small businesses while decimating the economy and ruining people’s lives.

An international class-action lawsuit, which is backed by more than 500-and-growing doctors and medical experts, aims to remedy the pain and suffering that tens of millions of innocent people have suffered at the hands of authoritarians who demanded “lockdowns” as the solution to the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).

Led by Dr. Reiner Fuellmich, one of the founders of the ACU, the lawsuit demands tens of billions of dollars in restitution for those who lost their jobs, developed mental problems, lost loved ones to suicide, or who otherwise suffered immensely due to the deadly “lockdowns” that were imposed on most of the West.

These government-ordered lockdowns “caused the loss of innumerable human lives, and have destroyed the economic existence of countless companies and individuals worldwide,” the suit explains.

Dr. Fuellmich specifically calls out the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) hysteria peddlers who induced “deliberate panic-mongering” in order to implement “fascist totalitarian models” of governance that were hatched by none other than communist China, the dictatorship responsible for unleashing the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).

Children everywhere, Dr. Fuellmich laments, have been “traumatized en masse” by the lockdowns and mask-wearing, “with the worst psychological consequences yet to be expected in the medium and long term.” And in Germany alone, as many as 800,000 small- and medium-sized businesses have closed due to the economic fallout of such restrictions.

Lockdowns and other draconian mandates represent “crimes against humanity”

All of this was predicated by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) declaration of a “pandemic” back in March, which was fraudulent to begin with considering the fact that the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) is hardly the universal death sentence that those with a horse in the race have long claimed it to be.

“This corona crisis, according to all we know today, must be renamed a corona scandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages,” Dr. Fuellmich explains in a video that, naturally, was banned by YouTube – you can still watch it here on Bitchute, though.

Dr. Fuellmich further warns that the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests being used to identify “cases” of the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) are fraudulent, as even the inventor of the test, Kary Mullis, admitted that “you can find almost anything in anybody” using a PCR test.

Mullis died just a few months before the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) started making headlines, but the fact of the matter is that the PCR test is not a reliable indicator of anything, and can easily be used to perpetrate massive fraud on the masses.

“Under the rules of civil tort law, all those who have been harmed by these PCR test-induced lockdowns are entitled to receive full compensation for their losses,” says Dr. Fuellmich who, by the way, has been incredibly successful with past litigation.

“In particular, there is a duty to compensate, i.e. a duty to pay damages for the loss of profits suffered by companies and self-employed persons as a result of the lockdowns and other measures,” he says.

"Coronavirus vaccine trial subjects report extreme exhaustion, shortness of breath, day-long headaches and shaking so violently that one of them cracked a tooth","(Natural News) Get ready for the depopulation kill shots that cause severe neurological damage and lobotomize anyone stupid enough to take them. Even mainstream media outlet CNBC.com is now reporting that vaccine trials conducted by Moderna and Pfizer are producing extreme side effects in trial subjects.

“High fever, body aches, headaches and exhaustion are some of the symptoms participants in Moderna and Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine trials say they felt after receiving the shots,” reports CNBC:

Luke Hutchison woke up in the middle of the night with chills and a fever after taking the Covid-19 booster shot in Moderna’s vaccine trial. Another coronavirus vaccine trial participant, testing Pfizer’s candidate, similarly woke up with chills, shaking so hard he cracked a tooth after taking the second dose.

High fever, body aches, bad headaches and exhaustion are just some of the symptoms five participants in two of the leading coronavirus vaccine trials say they felt after receiving the shots.

CNBC goes on to explain that the study participants then claimed all the pain, “was worth it.” Worth it for what? For a pandemic that’s already over for people under the age of 70?

These are all symptoms of neurological damage occurring in real time

Here’s a more detailed description of the side effects reported by a pro-science, pro-vaccine trial participant:

After getting the first shot on Aug. 18, he said he felt a little under the weather for several days with a low-grade fever. He got his second shot at a clinic on Sept. 15. Eight hours later, he said he was bed bound with a fever of over 101, shakes, chills, a pounding headache and shortness of breath. He said the pain in his arm, where he received the shot, felt like a “goose egg on my shoulder.” He hardly slept that night, recording that his temperature was higher than 100 degrees for five hours.

After 12 hours, Hutchison said he felt back to normal and his energy levels returned. Having signed a lengthy consent form, Hutchison was aware that he might experience symptoms. But he was still struck by the severity and duration, tweeting on Sept. 16 that he experienced “full on Covid-like symptoms.”

Does this sound like a “safe” vaccine to administer to hundreds of millions of people? Full-on Covid-like symptoms?

What CNBC isn’t saying, of course, is that all these symptoms — extreme exhaustion, long duration headaches and violent shaking — are signs of neurological damage happening in real time.

These are obvious signs that a kind of vaccine lobotomy is taking place, causing permanent, long-term neurological damage to the trial participants (who may already be brain damaged to begin with, as they volunteered for these medical experiments).

Fascinatingly, CNBC also explains that some people are dumb enough to raise their hands and actually volunteer to be used as human guinea pigs for these insane medical experiments:

Hutchison, a 44-year-old computational biologist in Utah, said he signed up for Moderna’s phase three trial because he’s healthy, physically fit and a big believer in vaccines. He specifically wanted to support Moderna’s effort, as he was intrigued by the company’s RNA-based approach.

CNBC says Luke Hutchison, “signed up to a coronavirus vaccine trial because he’s ‘pro science.'” It’s almost hilarious, if it weren’t so tragic. Little does he know that the vaccine cares nothing about science but everything about profits, which means rushing dangerous vaccines to market through the use of human medical experimentation that will no doubt kill some people along the way.

I doubt Hutchison will be feeling good about all this with his nervous system starts to disintegrate. But to each his own… People who think vaccines are rooted in “science” are in for a very rude awakening.

“Pro-science” vaccine trial participants may be covering up side effects to protect vaccine companies

It’s also clear that these trial participants are now being used as public relations puppets for the vaccine industry, and that’s a whole new, dangerous medical propaganda agenda that we haven’t seen before. When the trial participants enter the trials with a “pro-vaccine” cheerleading bias, they are likely to downplay the severity of the side effects they experience, and this causes the vaccine manufacturer to improperly assess the real adverse events associated with the vaccine.

In effect, the “pro-science” human guinea pigs rig the trials by covering up for the vaccine side effects, allowing the vaccine manufacturers to achieve FDA approval for dangerous, toxic vaccines that may go on to injure or kill far more people than the pandemic itself.

At some point, we all have to say, “If these people want to commit vaccine suicide, let them commit vaccine suicide,” because there’s nothing you can say to stop them. If they want to sacrifice their own lives in the name of “pro-science,” then that’s their free will choice.

After all, somebody has to be among the first pioneers to take the kill shots. Why not let people self-select for that and win the Darwin award for pro-science stupidity?

"OBEY OR ELSE: New England Journal of Medicine says people refusing MANDATORY coronavirus vaccines should be severely punished, locked in their homes and fired from their jobs","(Natural News) Welcome to the new medical fascism of 2020. The New England Journal of Medicine, the same fake science rag that committed total fraud to dishonestly smear hydroxychloroquine and protect the interests of vaccine companies, is now saying that all human beings must be forced to take mandatory vaccines. Those who refuse should face severe punishment, the NEJM insists, and insidious measures should be pursued to make sure no one can challenge the punishments in a court of law.

Source: Ensuring Uptake of Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, October 1, 2020, N Engl J Med 2020; 383:1296-1299

“[B]ecause of the infectiousness and dangerousness of the virus, relatively substantive penalties could be justified, including employment suspension or stay-at-home orders for persons in designated high-priority groups who refuse vaccination,” says the NEJM paper.

It also states that authoritarian medical personnel should bypass due process so that no one can challenge their orders in a court of law, stating, “Neither fines nor criminal penalties should be used, however… criminal penalties invite legal challenges on procedural due-process grounds [and] may stoke distrust.”

It goes on to explain that vaccine mandates should not be promoted as mandates. Instead, those who refuse vaccines should be harshly punished as a way to force the mandates without ever declaring it. “[S]tate mandates should not be structured as compulsory vaccination (absolute requirements); instead, noncompliance should incur a penalty,” the paper states.

And then, incredibly, the same paper goes on to claim that health authorities must “build public trust” through a “transparent and inclusive process,” even though the same paper openly claimed the public should be misled and coerced into vaccine mandates.

To its credit, the paper does argue that vaccine manufacturers should not be involved in crafting public policy or pushing mandates, since no one trusts the vaccine companies anymore. (Amazing how quickly that happened, isn’t it?)

So the bottom line here is as follows:

The health authoritarians are pushing for mandatory vaccines, but they won’t call them “mandates.”

Instead, they will PUNISH you for refusing to go along with their mandates, making your life miserable.

They are avoiding any mandates that could be challenged in a court of law in order to bypass due process.

They then claim this is how the vaccine industry can “build trust” with the public by pretending to be engaged in “transparency.”

Thanks to covid-19 tyrants, the whole idea of “informed consent” is now ancient history across the medical science establishment. Vaccine promoters believe they are the new “Judge Dredd” enforcers of society, and they believe that their experimental concoctions, no matter how risky or dangerous, should be forcibly injected into all human beings. Those who resist should be severely punished, they claim, and they will punish you in a way that you can’t challenge in a court of law.

And the fake news media is 100% behind all this and will shame you if you don’t go along.

Watch the warning from Dr. Carrie Madej in a new interview from just a few day ago:

In effect, they are rolling out a “vaccine social credit scoring” system that demands your compliance

What you’re watching here is a vaccine social credit scoring system being rolled out across America, right in front of our eyes.

Don’t want the vaccine shot? You’re fired from your job.

Still don’t want the shot? You’ll be prohibited from entering grocery stores and buying food.

Resisting the vaccine mandates? Health “authorities” will lock you in your own home, making you a prisoner without ever hauling you into court where you might be able to offer a defense against imprisonment.

This is the new covid-19 / vaccine authoritarian tyranny, and it’s being rolled out right this very minute, right in front of you, all across America. New York has just announced a second wave of lockdowns, and no one is resisting.

The sheeple will line up for the slaughter, and they will not speak out or resist as they are bled to death in the name of global population control. Anyone stupid enough to agree to be vaccinated is too stupid to represent the future of the human race. They will be systematically culled with the kill shot. How else will the globalists achieve their goal of exterminating over six billion humans, after all?

"BOMBSHELL: Former Pfizer executive says covid-19 “pandemic is over,” so-called “second wave” based on fraudulent testing","(Natural News) Despite claims by Anthony Fauci and others that Americans should brace for a “second wave” of the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19), former Pfizer Chief Science Officer Dr. Mike Yeadon says this is nothing but fear-mongering based on junk science and fraud.

A former vice president at the pharmaceutical giant, Dr. Yeadon claims that “almost all” of the tests being conducted for the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) are “false positives,” a phenomenon that has already been observed in Florida. Dr. Yeadon also says that “there is no science to suggest a second wave should happen.”

Any “second wave” that comes along is completely manufactured based on fake “new cases,” Dr. Yeadon is further quoted as saying, responding in the affirmative when asked if “we are basing a government policy, an economic policy, a civil liberties policy, in terms of limiting people to six persons in a meeting … all based on what may well be completely fake data.”

“Were it not for the test data that you get from the TV all the time, you would rightly conclude that the pandemic was over, as nothing much has happened,” Dr. Yeadon further stated, noting that more people will probably be admitted to hospitals for influenza in the coming months, but that these should not be mistaken as Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) admissions.

Be sure to check out the following video from Brighteon.com in which Dr. Yeadon talks to interviewer Julia Hartley-Brewer about the truth concerning the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) plandemic:

Dr. Yeadon published a paper suggesting that the “curve” was “flattened” months ago

Earlier this month, Dr. Yeadon and his colleagues published a paper they co-authored about the so-called “pandemic.” Entitled, “How Likely is a Second Wave?” this paper explains that most of the deaths associated with the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) occurred back in March and April, and quickly tapered off in the months that followed.

By April, most countries, including the U.S., had successfully “flattened the curve,” though increased testing, most of which is fraudulent, continues to report new “cases” that those in favor of continued pandemic restrictions are using as “evidence” to push for endless mask-wearing, physical distancing and in some cases, lockdowns.

“It has widely been observed that in all heavily infected countries in Europe and several of the U.S. states likewise, that the shape of the daily deaths vs. time curves is similar to ours in the U.K.,” this paper reveals. “Many of these curves are not just similar, but almost super imposable.”

This is further reflected in the latest survival figures, which since the month of May have risen to 99.8 percent of infections – meaning only 0.2 percent of people who test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) end up dying at some point after being “diagnosed.”

This 99.8 percent survival rate is significantly higher than the one proposed by Fauci back in March and April when he falsely claimed that upwards of 6 percent of Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) patients would die from the virus – meaning Fauci incorrectly claimed that the novel virus was 20 to 30 times more deadly than it actually is.

“The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) value accepted by Yeadon et al in the paper is .26%,” writes Ralph Lopez for HubPages. “The survival rate of a disease is 100% minus the IFR.”

Concerning the allegedly “novel” nature of the Wuhan coronavirus (covid-19), Dr. Yeadon claims that it is only novel in the sense that it is a new type of coronavirus. As it turns out, there are many other types of coronaviruses in existence, including four other strains that are freely circulating throughout the population as you read this.

“They all have striking sequence similarity to the new coronavirus,” Dr. Yeadon points out in his paper, offering a different perspective that is rarely, if ever, mentioned by the mainstream media.

Virologists documents biological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created as a bio-weapon and INTENTIONALLY released,"(Natural News) Li-Meng Yan, the Chinese virologist who was censored off various social media platforms, has published a second co-authored report warning that SARS-CoV-2 is an “unrestricted bio-weapon” that was not only created in a Wuhan lab, but was also released INTENTIONALLY by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Li-Meng Yan worked undercover at the University of Hong Kong and in a reference lab for the World Health Organization before coming clean about the scientific fraud behind China’s bio-weapon release. She and her colleagues discovered biological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created from a template virus (ZC45/ZXC21) and owned by military research laboratories that answer to the Chinese Communist Party.

Virologists warns that SARS-CoV-2 was created as a bio-weapon

The paper exposed how the template virus, owned by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), was engineered over a six-month time frame to become SARS-CoV2. The paper reveals that Wuhan virologists went beyond gain-of-function research to engineer the new bio-weapon, and even used data fabrications to cover up the origin of SARS-CoV2.

The report also takes a closer look at the RaTG13 virus, which was allegedly obtained from bat feces in 2013. The sequencing of this virus, published at GenBank, has been compared to SARS-CoV-2 and shown to be 96 percent identical. Because of RaTG13’s similarities with SARS-CoV-2, the Chinese Communist Party has alleged that both are naturally-occurring viruses. The CCP declared that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 must be naturally occurring because they are taken from a fecal sample. Fecal samples are typically 70-90 percent bacterial; but these sequences were only 1.7 percent fecal matter. Furthermore, RaTG13 contains segments of DNA not just from bats, but also from foxes, flying foxes, squirrels, and other animals.

Since no live virus or intact genome has ever been isolated or recovered in nature for RaTG13, the naturally-occurring theory is dis-proven. Therefore, these two viruses are part of an ongoing line of virus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.

According to the paper, the process for sequencing DNA itself “leaves room for potential fraud.” The RaTG13 genome “could easily be fabricated.” Its entry on GenBank proves the viral genomic sequences and its associated sequencing reads are assembled and do not offer definitive proof that the viral genome is correctly represented.

The paper details how the RNA viral genome can be fabricated on GenBank with careful execution. After the genomic sequence is created on a computer, segments of the genome can be synthesized based on the sequence. After amplifying each DNA segment through PCR, the researcher can send the PCR products for sequencing. These may contain sequencing samples from an alleged host that are mixed with genetic material from the host, which is ultimately (fraudulently) used to determine the sequence of the virus from these “raw sequencing reads” which are then published on GenBank. This laboratory concoction, fused with a host and amplified, can then be used as false evidence to declare the virus to be a “natural-occurring” version of the corresponding virus.

Furthermore, the researchers took a closer look at the spike genes of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13. They found no evidence of natural evolution when compared to sequences of naturally-evolving coronaviruses. The report finds that the RBM region of the S1/spike of the RaTG13 strain had be edited in order to retain the 96.2 percent sequence identity. The report also finds that “All fabricated coronaviruses share a 100% amino acid sequence identity on the E protein with ZC45 and ZXC21,” a process that served as a template for the creation of SARS-CoV-2.

We must stop China’s bio-weapon research now and hold them accountable for war crimes

Because the genomic sequence is readily manipulated, what if the tests for covid-19 are unable to locate the precise genomic sequence? What if the vaccines currently in development do not contain the correct strain? What if multiple bio-weapon strains already exist, with various degrees of infectivity? What if China’s bio-weapon research is already ten steps ahead of the public health hysteria, and the CCP is preparing to unleash even more lethal bio-weapons? If China’s scientific fraud and bio-weapon research is not halted, then what’s stopping the rogue communist regime from unleashing a new bio-weapon every six months to stealthily perpetuate outbreaks that can be engineered to subvert detection?

COVID-19 vaccine trial participant DIES… AstraZeneca downplays the death and continues the medical experiments on the remaining humans,"(Natural News) A person who volunteered for the medical experimentation on humans with the COVID-19 vaccine has died during clinical trials, reports The Epoch Times. The death was confirmed by government officials in Brazil, where the trial was taking place, and the company whose vaccine is being tested in the medical experiments — AstraZeneca — says it will continue its experiments on the remaining human survivors.

No deaths will stand in the way of vaccine profits, it seems.

“The volunteer died on Oct. 15,” reports The Epoch Times. “It’s not clear whether the volunteer received the placebo shot or the vaccine.”

Had this person died in any other context, their death would of course have been counted as a “covid-19 death,” but since they are involved in a vaccine trial, the scheming mainstream media will claim the person received a placebo, not a live vaccine. Such claims are complete fiction, given that no such patient data are allowed to be released on individual patients. As TET reports:

The health authority noted that “data on clinical research volunteers must be kept confidential, in accordance with the principles of confidentiality, human dignity, and protection of participants,” according to a news release.

Thus, any media outlet reporting the vaccine trial participant was part of the placebo group is lying. Then again, all they do is lie.

The human medical experiments continue, no matter how many die in the process

“We cannot comment on individual cases in an ongoing trial of the Oxford vaccine as we adhere strictly to medical confidentiality and clinical trial regulations, but we can confirm that all required review processes have been followed,” said AstraZeneca in a public statement.

This isn’t the first indication of dangerous side effects linked to coronavirus vaccines. “It came after AstraZeneca said on Sept. 8 that its vaccine trial was placed on hold due to an illness in a patient in the United Kingdom,” reports TET. “The Food and Drug Administration placed a late-stage clinical trial from AstraZeneca on hold in the United States.”

Just yesterday, Natural News reported how Johnson & Johnson was forced to halt another coronavirus vaccine trial after a trial participant experienced an “unexplained illness.” As that story explains:

Johnson & Johnson is pausing its Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine trial after a study participant fell ill. The halt comes just weeks after the company announced that they were in the final stage of the trials.

In its news release, Johnson & Johnson said that the trial was paused in compliance with regulatory standards after the unnamed participant developed an “unexplained illness.”

In related news, nine people have died in South Korea after receiving flu shots there, causing a nationwide panic over the “death vaccines” that are killing so many people so quickly. As Strange Sounds reports:

Nine people have died after getting flu shots in South Korea in the past week, raising concerns over the vaccine’s safety just as the seasonal inoculation programme is expanded to head off potential COVID-19 complications.

Health authorities there are saying the vaccines didn’t kill anyone, since the dead people had “underlying health conditions,” which is exactly what Natural News warned would be said about vaccine deaths as the body count started to accelerate. Notably, when people with underlying health conditions die with a coronavirus infection, they are said to have died from covid-19. But when they have underlying health conditions and are found dead after receiving a vaccine injection, health authorities claim the vaccine isn’t related to their death.

How convenient.

Operation Fast Kill

It all begs the question: If human volunteers are now starting to die during the carefully controlled trials that recruit extremely healthy individuals for testing, what’s going to happen when these risky, rushed vaccines are unleashed upon the wildly unhealthy general public?

Operation Warp Speed is about to become Operation Fast Kill, it seems.

Then again, there’s no faster way for globalists to exterminate people who are too stupid to realize the covid-19 agenda is actually an extermination agenda targeting the human race.

On the other hand, those who are intelligent enough to want to survive should be steering clear of all vaccines and vaccine industry medical experiments carried out on humans. Obviously.

"President Trump and First Lady both test “positive” for COVID-19… doesn’t that mean Joe Biden and Chris Wallace are now infected, too?","(Natural News) President Trump announced late last night that he and First Lady Melania Trump have both “tested positive” for covid-19. According to his tweet (below), “We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”

But does this test result mean anything? We already know from numerous media reports — including the NY Times — that the vast majority of “positive” test results are false.

Neither President Trump nor Melania Trump are showing any symptoms of sickness, so they don’t quality as being sickened by the coronavirus.

Furthermore, President Trump is likely still taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure, which means his real-world risk of ever showing symptoms of sickness is extremely low, despite his age of 74.

This diagnosis is probably meaningless. The tests currently being used to diagnose “positive” cases are extremely unreliable and can be triggered by almost any previous coronavirus infection, such as a common cold type coronavirus.

In fact, nearly all the global testing for covid-19 is scientifically meaningless. Since there’s no science-based confidence in either the accuracy or specificity of such tests, they offer no useful information to someone who either tests positive or negative.

Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2020

“Trump had rallies scheduled on Friday and Saturday in Florida and Wisconsin, respectively, but it is unlikely that those will go forward,” reports Breitbart.com. But it seems pointless to alter the president’s schedule based on a test result that isn’t reliable in the first place.

Some users at Brighteon.social are speculating that the covid-19 diagnosis may be a cover for Trump going into hiding while he activates a military response against left-wing insurrectionists and deep state traitors. That’s pure speculation at this point, but it does seem like America is headed into a civil war / uprising scenario where the president will need to take extraordinary measures to protect himself and his family members from a deep state coup attempt.

Watch for deranged Leftists to now publicly hope that Trump will die from the infection, because that’s the kind of “death wish” lunatics they are.

In truth, President Trump is extremely unlikely to be harmed by the virus, because most covid-19 deaths occur among elderly people who are killed by ventilators or who suffer from numerous severe health conditions such as high blood pressure or strokes.

The real question here is that if Trump is truly infected, then did Trump accidentally infect Joe Biden since both candidates were screaming and spitting at each other during the recent debate?

And is Fox News fake moderator Chris Wallace infected, too, since he was sitting right in front of them while wearing no mask? Wouldn’t that be the most ironic story of the year if President Trump infected Chris Wallace with the coronavirus while Wallace interrupted him 75 times in 90 minutes?

Finally, Joe Biden visually appears to be in far worse health than Trump, so if Biden gets infected, he would seemingly have a much higher risk of serious complications or death. Then again, if Joe Biden disappeared into a lockdown quarantine, nobody could tell the difference, since he almost never appears in public anyway.",10/2/20 0:00,,0
Irrefutable: The coronavirus was engineered by scientists in a lab using well documented genetic engineering vectors that leave behind a “fingerprint”,"(Natural News) Every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists. The proof is in the virus itself: The tools for genetic insertion are still present as remnants in the genetic code. Since these unique gene sequences don’t occur by random chance, they’re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab.

But the WHO and CDC are covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China and its biological weapons program, since no government wants the public to know the full truth about how frequently government-run labs experience outbreaks. Decades ago, for example, the U.S. Army ran an Ebola bioweapons lab in the United States, where a monkey infected one of the scientists there. The strain turned out to be infectious only in monkeys, not humans, so the world dodged a bullet, but the U.S. Army “nuked” the entire facility with chemical bombs, killing all the monkeys and wiping out any last remnant of the virus on U.S. soil.

You can read the full details of that incident in the book The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. We’ve also covered it at NaturalNews.com, where this book description is reprinted:

In 1989, Reston, VA — one of the most famous U.S. planned communities located about 10 miles from Washington DC — stood at the epicenter of a potential biological disaster. This well-known story was narrated by Richard Preston in a bone chilling account related to the recognition and containment of a devastating tropical filovirus at a monkey facility — the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit.

That outbreak occurred because Ebola was found to be spreading through the air ducts, confirming that Ebola can spread through the air. This simple fact was vigorously covered up by the entire medical establishment during the Ebola scare in the United States many years later, where the CDC transported an infected patient to a hospital in Dallas, subsequently infecting a nurse who was treated with highly toxic chemicals that caused permanent kidney damage (she later sued the hospital for the damage she suffered).

The reason this is relevant is because in order to understand the coronavirus situation in China, we must first realize that virology research labs routinely experience lapses in containment. Even the United States has failed to contain deadly viral strains when trying to study them. China’s BSL-4 labs have experienced multiple accidental releases of SARS strains, and this new coronavirus is now confirmed to be an engineered strain that was either used in bioweapons research or vaccine experiments.

The genomic coding in the virus is not natural, in other words. Just as you would never encounter a snake in the desert that’s writing a book containing words and grammatical structure, the genetic sequences now identified in the coronavirus strain are, without question, proof that human engineers have been tinkering with the strain.

How to genetically engineer viruses: the pShuttle vector

One of the tools used to accomplish this genetic engineering is called pShuttle. It’s a genetic tool set that can carry a payload of genes to be inserted into the target virus.

Researchers engaged in genetic engineering can purchase the pShuttle sequence from online retailers such as AddGenes.org, which sells the sequence for $75, shipped in “bacteria as agar stab.”

The following map outlines the complete gene sequence of the pShuttle tool:

The method for using pShuttle is described in a PubMed document entitled, “A simplified system for generating recombinant adenoviruses.”

The summary of the paper describes, “a strategy that simplifies the generation and production of such viruses.” Here’s how the process works to achieve genetic engineering of viruses:

A recombinant adenoviral plasmid is generated with a minimum of enzymatic manipulations, using homologous recombination in bacteria rather than in eukaryotic cells. After transfections of such plasmids into a mammalian packaging cell line, viral production is conveniently followed with the aid of green fluorescent protein, encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone. Homogeneous viruses can be obtained from this procedure without plaque purification.

The paper describes how this approach will, “expedite the process of generating and testing recombinant adenoviruses.”

During this process, of course, the pShuttle leaves behind unique code, a “fingerprint” of the genetic modification. It is this fingerprint that has now been identified in the coronavirus.

As revealed by genomics researcher James Lyons-Weiler in this bombshell analysis article, the pShuttle genetic code is found in the coronavirus that’s circulating in the wild.

This is proof that the virus has been engineered by human scientists.

“IPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378,” writes Lyons-Weiler for IPAK:

Another gene sequence also shows a 92% match with the Spike protein from the SARS coronavirus:

The process for achieving this was patented by Chinese researchers as shown in this patent link.

The pShuttle vector was used to insert SARS genes into the coronavirus, a process that makes it deadly to humans. “The very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials,” warns Lyons-Weiler:

The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.

He also warns about, “studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals – rats, ferrets, and monkeys – in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus.”

He concludes:

If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.

Another doctor from Beijing Medical University warns the virus appears to be genetically engineered

Lyons-Weiler is not alone in his assessment of the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus. Dr. Yuhong Dong, who holds a doctorate degree in infectious diseases from Beijing University, writes in The Epoch Times:

Based on recently published scientific papers, this new coronavirus has unprecedented virologic features that suggest genetic engineering may have been involved in its creation. The virus presents with severe clinical features, thus it poses a huge threat to humans. It is imperative for scientists, physicians, and people all over the world, including governments and public health authorities, to make every effort to investigate this mysterious and suspicious virus in order to elucidate its origin and to protect the ultimate future of the human race.



Dr. Yuhong reminds us that a Jan. 30 science paper published in The Lancet concludes that, “recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus.” In other words, this did not occur through natural mutations in the wild.

He also points to a Jan. 27th study by five Greek scientists who also concluded the coronavirus has no lineage to other viruses in the “family tree” that’s found in the wild. He writes:

A Jan. 27 2020, study by 5 Greek scientists analyzed the genetic relationships of 2019-nCoV and found that “the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus,” and has an unusual middle segment never seen before in any coronavirus. All this indicates that 2019-nCoV is a brand-new type of coronavirus. The study’s authors rejected the original hypothesis that 2019-nCoV originated from random natural mutations between different coronaviruses.

“No bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market”

Dr. Yuhong writes about The Lancet study by authors Roujian Lu et al., from the China Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, repeating a quote from that paper:

First, the outbreak was first reported in late December 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV.

In other words, it isn’t from bats.

That means the entire mainstream media is lying to us about the real origins of the coronavirus.

That same paper goes on to underscore the misinformation in the official explanation, stating, “Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases—27 of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another—were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere.”

Both Lu (in The Lancet paper linked above) and Lyons-Weiler point to the presence of a SARS binding protein sequence in the coronavirus that allows it to easily infect human cells. As explained in The Epoch Times:

…despite considerable genetics distance between the Wuhan CoV and the human-infecting SARS-CoV, and the overall low homology of the Wuhan CoV S-protein to that of SARS-CoV, the Wuhan CoV S-protein had several patches of sequences in the receptor binding (RBD) domain with a high homology to that of SARS-CoV. The residues at positions 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 in SARS-CoV S-protein were reported to be at receptor complex interface and considered critical for cross species and human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV. So to our surprise, despite replacing four out of five important interface amino acid residues, the Wuhan CoV S-protein was found to have a significant binding affinity to human ACE2. …The Wuhan CoV S-protein and SARS-CoV S-protein shared an almost identical 3-D structure in the RBD domain, thus maintaining similar van der Waals and electrostatic properties in the interaction interface. Thus the Wuhan CoV is still able to pose a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S protein–ACE2 binding pathway. (emphasis added)



As Dr. Yuhong asks, “How could this novel virus be so intelligent as to mutate precisely at selected sites while preserving its binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor? How did the virus change just four amino acids of the S-protein? Did the virus know how to use Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) to make sure this would happen?”

It couldn’t happen by chance, in other words. The coronavirus is not a random mutation in the wild. It was engineered.

Many other scientists around the world are now investigating the gene sequences found in the coronavirus, and they are increasingly concluding that elements of the virus have been engineered.

Many of those scientists are being threatened and censored. One paper has so far been forced to be withdrawn and revised, no doubt to remove the key conclusions that point to the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus, but the proof of its engineering cannot be denied forever.

Brighteon.com/0bddc3da-f590-445e-ac38-9a74e358a57c

Either the coronavirus was genetically engineered, or the science establishment is going to have to throw out the entire field of genomics research and claim it isn’t real

Eventually, the science establishment is either going to have to conclude that this coronavirus strain was engineered, or that all the laws of genetics science don’t work, and gene sequencing is imaginary (sort of like transgenderism by the “progressive” Left, which has already abandoned biological reality).

So far they’ve tried to bamboozle the public into believing this is all some sort of accident from Mother Nature, but that has only worked because most of the public doesn’t understand enough science to counter the official propaganda. However, there are more than enough independent scientists around the world to prove that this pandemic strain was engineered by humans. More evidence is coming out each day.

Interestingly, as this article is going to press, all the official numbers of infections and deaths from coronavirus have been frozen for about 14 hours and counting, almost as if every nation of the world has agreed to stop reporting new numbers. This may be a temporary situation that gets resolved in the next few hours, but it’s highly suspicious. For the last week, we’ve been getting new updates about every 12 hours or sooner, and we’ve never seen the count frozen for this long.

At the same time, an 11th case of coronavirus has now been confirmed by the CDC in the United States, revealing that infections are continuing to spread in the USA, despite the efforts of the CDC to contain the outbreak.

"Can 5G exposure alter the structure and function of hemoglobin, causing coronavirus patients to die from oxygen deprivation?","(Natural News) Is 5G to partially blame for coronavirus deaths? Can 5G cause the blood that’s circulating in your body to be unable to carry oxygen?

What’s especially horrifying about the critical care of coronavirus patients is that they aren’t suffering from “viral pneumonia,” but rather from an inability to absorb or carry oxygen in the blood.

This has been confirmed by NYC ICU emergency physician Cameron Kyle-Sidell, who has released several videos detailing how coronavirus is not a kind of viral pneumonia. “We’re treating the wrong disease,” he says. And the ventilators are damaging the lungs of patients. He explains:

COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one. Rather, it appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most resembling high altitude sickness. Is it as if tens of thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at 30,000 feet at the cabin pressure is slowly being let out. These patients are slowly being starved of oxygen.

Watch him explain how coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen starvation, not from a viral pneumonia lung infection:

What this emergency room physician makes clear is that coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen deprivation, not a classic scenario of viral pneumonia. The patients’ lungs work fine, in other words, and the ventilators are actually damaging their lungs by forcing excessive pressure into them.

How does blood transport oxygen in the first place?

How, exactly, can all these patients be starved of oxygen when their lungs are technically working just fine? To understand one possible answer, you have to first understand how the blood carries oxygen. It’s way more fascinating than you might have supposed.

When functioning normally, 1 molecule of hemoglobin binds with 4 molecules of oxygen, using iron (Fe2+), forming oxyhemoglobin. But this binding is only achieved because of something called “partial pressure” which means the concentration of oxygen in the lung tissues is higher than the concentration of oxygen on the hemoglobin molecule (roughly stated, this is simplified somewhat), so the oxygen “leaps” to the hemoglobin in order to equalize the partial pressures across the chasm.

But 5G radiation alters the porosity of cell membranes, allowing some molecules or ionic elements to move more easily across those members, displacing other molecules (or soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide) that might normally make that leap. For example, it is well documented that 5G radiation causes “Voltage Gated Ion Channels” (VGIC), specifically with calcium ions (VGCC), causing cellular toxicity due to too much calcium entering the cell walls and poisoning the cells.

The research on this was published in Environmental Research — here’s the link — and reveals that 5G exposure not only alters cell permeability (porosity), but also releases peroxinitrites in the body. These are inflammation-producing molecules that ravage other healthy molecules circulating in the blood.

As described by Natural News:

A thorough review of the available published science on wireless (WiFi) and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) exposure has identified at least seven different ways that WiFi and EMF microwave pollution actively harms the human body.

Published in the journal Environmental Research, the peer-reviewed paper explains that exposure to WiFi signals, which are everywhere these days, can lead to: oxidative stress, sperm and testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG (electroencephalogram) changes, apoptosis (programmed cell death), cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload.

Note that coronavirus patients are already being observed with neuropsychiatric effects, testicular damage and oxidative stress, three of the symptoms of 5G exposure.

We just created this simple chart to point out the similarities between 5G exposure and coronavirus symptoms. Feel free to share everywhere, and link back to this article if possible:

Mass insanity due to psychiatric effects of cellular poisoning

We also know that 5G radiation and its effects on the cells of the body can lead to symptoms of insanity, hallucinations and even powerful personality changes. Interestingly, CNN’s Chris Cuomo already described bouts of hallucinations as he was battling the coronavirus, living in a high-5G city (NYC). As I wrote on Natural News last December:

5G radiation causes “neuropsychiatric” effects through a mechanism described as ion potentiation poisoning of brain cells, according to research published in Environmental Research.

This results in behavioral changes and even personality changes among those who are routinely exposed, researchers found. In other words, 5G is a weapon system that doubles as a telecommunications infrastructure, but the real impact is to damage human brain function and destroy rationality, reason and civility, especially among those who live in high population cities where 5G towers are becoming ubiquitous. That’s why you may have noticed increased insanity and widespread mental derangement in those areas.

Part of this effect may also be due to the production of peroxynitrites, which are generated in the body’s cells upon exposure to the voltage emitted by 5G radiation, which is beamed at your body in a narrow cone of high-intensity energy. (5G antennae focus energy in a tight beam that follows you around.)

We are already observing the coronavirus causing psychiatric effects, including zombie-like violent, aggressive behavior such as deliberately spitting and coughing on people.

How 5G radiation exposure alters the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen

Getting back to the oxygen question, the answer to why 5G radiation exposure may alter the function of hemoglobin is found in understanding the protein structure of hemoglobin itself.

Hemoglobin relies on something called the “heme group” which is a complex molecule with iron (FE 2+) in its center. This is surrounded by something called a “porphyrin ring” which is a cluster of unique structures (made of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen) that has a special affinity for other oxygen atoms. The ability for oxygen to “leap” onto this molecule in the lungs depends entirely on the structure (which also implies the ionic charges) of these complex molecules.

One thing to note in all this is that without the presence of histidine, a special protein, this heme group would have higher affinity toward carbon monoxide than oxygen, meaning the entire heme group would be occupied by carbon monoxide, blocking the absorption of oxygen. Thus, the histidine presence is critical for allowing the heme group to bind with oxygen. If you mess with histidine, you end up forcing hemoglobin to carry CO instead of O2, effectively creating oxygen deprivation in the blood.

This heme group, by the way, has special affinity for carbon dioxide, which allows the same molecule to carry CO2 out of the body’s cells and transport CO2 back to the lungs. Remember: The same hemoglobin molecule must carry both CO2 and O2 but at different times, and it must attract and then release those molecules at opposite times in order to rid the body of CO2 and nourish the body with O2. This is all accomplished with a delicate balance of proteins and protein folding.

The hemoglobin molecule itself is a miracle of nanotechnology. It transmorphs into two different structural states based on whether it’s carrying oxygen or not. In what’s called the “R-state,” this molecule is like a magnet for oxygen. When four oxygen atoms are bound, it becomes a highly stable structure (and appears red). Technically, the binding of a single molecule of oxygen (O2) increases the affinity toward oxygen on the three other oxygen sites, making the hemoglobin “mop up” four oxygen molecules very quickly. When it lacks oxygen, it changes to a “T-state” and appears blue, which is why low-oxygen blood has a blue color.

The important thing to understand in all this is that any alteration of the delicate structure of hemoglobin will impair its ability to bind with oxygen.

Take a look at the hemoglobin molecule representation above, from APSUbiology.org, and note the heme groups which are positioned in four places across the molecule. The polypeptide chains are part of the transmorphing structure of the molecule that allows it to carry and release both CO2 and O2, depending on the partial pressures of the gasses at different locations in the body (lungs vs. other cells). Note carefully that any change in the structure of hemoglobin will cause it to stop functioning:

Increasing the permeability of the hemoglobin molecule — i.e. its affinity toward other soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide — will “occupy” the hemoglobin molecule with the wrong substances, making it unable to absorb oxygen because it is not presenting in its “R-state” by the time the heart pumps the blood back to the lungs.

Stated another way, anything that significantly alters the affinity of hemoglobin toward other soluble gasses (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or even ionic minerals in the blood) could “shut off” the ability of blood to carry oxygen by altering its atomic structure.

If you change the structure of the heme group, it no longer functions to transport oxygen. Because in the case of the heme group, the structure is the function. Perhaps this can only be appreciated by organic chemists, but this heme group is truly a miracle of nanotechnology.

Here’s a diagram of how iron, histidine, the heme group and O2 oxygen molecules interact with hemoglobin, which alters its structure depending on the “oxygenated” vs. “deoxygenated” forms: (via Biology.Kenyon.edu)

Can 5G exposure alter the structure of hemoglobin by increasing its affinity toward other molecules which are not O2?

The real question in all this is best phrased as I have asked it above. I doubt that we are dealing with a phenomenon where 5G radiation exposures blocks the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen, but rather occupies the hemoglobin molecule with other elements that alter its structure and therefore its function, inhibiting its ability to bind with oxygen.

This is very likely happening all across the world wherever 5G is currently functioning, it’s just that the coronavirus is now exacerbating the symptoms and conditions to the point where mass death is occurring.

In other words, the coronavirus pandemic would likely not be nearly as bad if 5G exposure / radiation pollution wasn’t already compromising the structure and function of hemoglobin cells in the bodies of people who live in 5G cities.

This doesn’t mean the coronavirus isn’t real, of course; just that these two attacks on the human body have a synergistic effect of toxicity and mortality.

Conclusion: Humanity is committing suicide with 5G

While I strongly disagree with those who are claiming there’s no such thing as a virus or that the coronavirus is a hoax, I do agree that the widespread deployment of 5G antennas is a kind of suicide pact for the world.

Just as the Romans built their aqueducts out of lead linings and thereby poisoned their own citizens, driving them insane with load poisoning, the modern world of Big Tech and telecommunications is mass poisoning humanity with electropollution.

Right now, a lot of people are talking about the book, “The Invisible Rainbow” by John Kaminski, who believes coronavirus is an “electrical disease” and that 5G alone is causing all the mass deaths, not the virus. He writes things like, “The flu is not contagious” and “the quarantine is all a terrible hoax.”

Surely he is wrong on those claims, but he may not be wrong at all about the toxicity of electropollution and how 5G is actually a kind of “suicide system” that’s destroying humanity.

This all deserves a tremendous amount of additional study, but because we live in a world where Big Tech controls all the narratives and censors all those who question the safety of 5G, it now seems impossible for humanity to extricate itself from this mass suicide mission that has already been unleashed.

And that doesn’t even cover the topic of vaccines. What if Bill Gates’ vaccines are being deliberately engineered to contain toxic substances that 5G exposure will push into the cells, causing widespread death from “binary” exposure and subsequent cell toxicity?

It sure would be a simple way for Bill Gates to achieve his global depopulation dreams, all while administering a global IQ test that finds out which people are stupid enough to line up and be injected with a euthanasia weapon system.

"BREAKING: Researchers claim 100 percent cure rate vs. covid-19 in 100+ patient trial conducted in Ecuador, using intravenous chlorine dioxide","(Natural News) Preliminary data from a clinical trial involving more than 100 covid-19 patients in Ecuador has resulted in a claimed 100 cure rate within four days, according to Andreas Kalcker who is closely following the results of the effort. The tests were carried out by the Asociacion Ecuatoriana de Medicos Expertos en Medicina Integrativa, a group of integrative medicine practitioners.

Ecuador has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus, and the current “standard of care” promoted by Western medicine — largely based on the use of ventilators — has been killing the vast majority of critical patients while utterly failing to address the real root of the problem.

Covid-19 isn’t an Acute Respiratory Disease (ARD), it turns out. Rather, it often presents as an inflammation and blood clotting condition (see The Lancet research, below) which causes the blood to be unable to carry oxygen, resulting in patient hypoxia and eventual asphyxiation.

This is why intravenous chlorine dioxide — which immediately delivers a high dose of oxygen to blood cells — is believed to work so effectively against covid-19. It reportedly restores the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and clears the clotting in the lungs, all while destroying pathogens.

Chlorine dioxide researcher and advocate Andreas Kalcker has posted a video (in Spanish) where he explains the findings. That video, entitled, “Mas de 100 Casos de Covid-19 recuperados con CDS por medicos de Aememi,” is found at this link on Lbry.tv.

A video embed is offered here:

In the video, Andreas explains that researchers were able to achieve a complete cure in just four days through the use of intravenous chlorine dioxide (ClO2). Here’s a photo of some of the researchers holding syringes of chlorine dioxide, which is then infused into the patients’ blood, where it releases a wave of oxygen that researchers believe saturates the blood with O2 while killing pathogens:

Another clinical trial involving chlorine dioxide is currently under way, documented by the US National Library of Medicine at ClinicalTrials.gov. The study uses oral chlorine dioxide (rather than intravenous) and is entitled, “Determination of the Effectiveness of Oral Chlorine Dioxide in the Treatment of COVID 19.” The trial is being conducted by the Genesis Foundation and involves 20 patients.

The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for that trial is NCT04343742.

Andreas Kalcker explains in his video that chlorine dioxide is a powerful disinfectant that destroys viruses and bacteria. The substance has long been used in water purification processes and is approved by various US government agencies for as a water treatment and purification agent.

This video frame shows blood cells being flooded with oxygen from ClO2, instantly reducing clotting / coagulation:

Covid-19 is not an acute respiratory disease

In another bombshell science paper published May 7, 2020, in The Lancet, researchers Dennis McGonagle and others determined that covid-19 is not a respiratory disease but rather “diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy,” a kind of blood clotting that presents in lung tissue.

This explains why patients with covid-19 are dying from hypoxia (lack of oxygen) and are frequently killed by the use of ventilators. As an ICU doctor from New York warned months ago, doctors are treating the wrong disease. (That doctor’s YouTube channel was deleted and all his videos were censored, of course. No one is allowed to question medical orthodoxy in the medical police state known as the United States of America.)

Study authors also found the inflammation triggers a worsening of the condition, which implies that anti-inflammatory interventions might be the key to saving lives and ending the pandemic. From the study:

The immune mechanism underlying diffuse alveolar and pulmonary interstitial inflammation in COVID-19 involves a MAS-like state that triggers extensive immunothrombosis…

MAS stands for Macrophage Activation Syndrome, and it is an inflammatory response stemming from an over-reactive immune response, similar to the “cytokine storm” that’s being widely discussed (which vitamin C helps prevent, according to published research). As the study explains:

The severity of systemic inflammation in response to human coronavirus family members has features reminiscent of a cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), also known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH).

Figure 1 from the study:

To simplify these findings, covid-19 is not acute viral pneumonia impacting the respiratory system but rather an inflammation-based immunological response that leads to thrombosis (clotting in the lungs) which kills the patient. The use of ventilators only makes the problem worse, which is why previous observational studies have found that 88% of patients put on ventilators end up dying. They are dying because the ventilator treatment is the wrong treatment.

Chlorine dioxide is reportedly saving 100 percent of the patients studied so far because chlorine dioxide floods the blood with instantly usable oxygen while killing the pathogens responsible for clotting. There is also anecdotal evidence that some people are beating covid-19 infections with high doses of aspirin, a blood thinner, although this information should not be taken as advice for treatment, and far more research is needed on blood thinners and anti-inflammatory interventions.

This may also help explain why turmeric and vitamin D are associated with strong reductions in inflammation in the body, which may prove useful in balancing the immune response and preventing the kind of imbalance that can lead to immune system overreactions.

The criminal medical cartels are censoring all treatments and cures that work to save lives

Notably, the criminal Big Pharma cartels and corrupt government regulators (like the FDA, FTC, CDC) are going out of their way to try to criminalize or suppress any non-vaccine, non-pharma solutions that might save lives. Over the last month, we’ve all witnessed an astonishing level of aggression and mafia-style tactics used by the FDA and FTC against pioneering researchers offering a variety of possible solutions, from colloidal silver to chlorine dioxide and even intravenous vitamin C.

They’ve even declared war on hydroxychloroquine and the medical establishment has been engineering clinical trials which are designed to fail from the start in order to discredit the off-patent, affordable drug.

There is no doubt that Big Pharma’s obedient government lackeys are at war with truth and are desperately trying to suppress information about natural cures and integrative treatments that might eliminate covid-19 before vaccines can be made available.

The techno-fascist tech giants like Facebook, Google, Vimeo, YouTube and Twitter are all-in with Big Pharma, going out of their way to censor and destroy all information that criticizes vaccines or offers wisdom about natural treatments or integrative medicine interventions. This criminal cabal of Big Tech and Big Pharma is the enemy of humanity, as they are deliberately working to worsen the pandemic, increase suffering and death and extend the punishing lockdowns for as long as possible in order to cause several economic damage while preparing the masses for mandatory vaccines.

We are all witnessing a powerful criminal gang of corporations and regulators who are deliberately seeking to destroy human society as we know it today, and they are the gatekeepers of information on the ‘net (and in the news). This is why we are repeating our call for the CEOs of all the top tech giants to be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity, then prosecuted in a court of law. Over the weekend, a member of Italy’s Parliament gave a rousing speech in which she labeled Bill Gates a “vaccine criminal” and demanded he be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity.

Such efforts should not be limited to Bill Gates, however. They must include the criminals of other tech giants as well as the corrupt, anti-human criminals running the FDA, FTC and CDC, among others. Their crimes against humanity must not go unanswered, and they must be held accountable in a court of law.

The destructive, anti-human agendas of Big Pharma and Big Tech are incompatible with human freedom and a sustainable human civilization. These anti-human institutions must be permanently dismantled, and humanity must rise up against this threat in the same way we once awakened against the Third Reich and the rise of Nazi fascism and the Holocaust.

Right now, Big Pharma, Big Tech, the FDA and the CDC are plotting to kill billions of human beings with an engineered bioweapon, a risky vaccine, and high-fatality prescription drugs that make people more vulnerable to covid-19. These enemies of humanity must be stopped, and the truth about chlorine dioxide must be set free so that human beings can be saved from suffering and death.

To learn more about the establishment’s war on truth (and war on humanity), watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits, who has also been subjected to extreme censorship for raising the alarm about how vaccines are spreading infectious disease.

CONFIRMED: CoVid-19 coronavirus found to contain unique “gain-of-function” property “for efficient spreading in the human population” … exact quote from science paper just published in Antiviral Resea,"(Natural News) We now have bombshell, smoking gun evidence that the CoVid-19 “Wuhan” coronavirus was specifically engineered as an offensive biological warfare weapon, designed to target to exterminate human beings.

A new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Antiviral Research (Vol. 16, April 2020) is entitled, “The spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade.”

It reveals that the CoVid-19 coronavirus contains unique features that allow it to function as a more efficient weapon system for human-to-human transmission, which helps explain why the virus has been impossible to contain (even under “quarantine” conditions, which have universally failed in China, Japan, Korea and elsewhere).

As the science authors of the paper explain in the full text, “This furin-like cleavage site… may provide a gain-of-function to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population.” (Emphasis added)

Further, the science paper finds that there is no known viral ancestry to the CoVid-19 coronavirus, meaning it did not evolve from nature. It was engineered, and the science paper authors also state that the virus contains elements from MERS, stating, “Before the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, this important feature was not observed in the lineage b of betacoronaviruses.”

The abstract and full PDF (paid) of the study are available through this link at ScienceDirect.com:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220300528

The “smoking gun” aspects of this research were brought to light earlier today by Prof. Frances Boyle who appeared on the Alex Jones Show (2nd broadcast hour, Feb. 19th, 2020, InfoWars.com) to reveal his findings that confirm the Wuhan coronavirus was an engineered biological weapon.

Tomorrow we will publish the full transcript from that interview, containing stunning new details about the origin of the viral weapon. You can watch the full 47-minute segment here, via Brighteon.com. The full interview is also available on Banned.video.

Brighteon.com/b4e196ff-d85f-45c4-b4e0-8bc1bea6dc09

The following graphic from the published study shows some of the S-protein sequences found in the CoVid-19 “Wuhan” coronavirus which share a nearly identical pattern with MERS-CoV, but not with any previous ancestry of “lineage b” type coronavirus:

The new feature engineered into the Wuhan coronavirus has, “the potential to cleave specifically viral envelope glycoproteins, thereby enhancing viral fusion with host cell membranes,” conclude study authors.

This feature results in, “higher pathogenicity, pronounced neural symptoms and neurotropism in infected chickens,” according to the paper. That means, essentially, it kills more easily and causes nervous system damage while infecting nerve cells. Note that many of the human victims in China appear to suffer seizures and a total, almost instantaneous nervous system shutdown, literally collapsing in seconds.

Furthermore, this enhanced property of the virus results in, “a widening of the cell tropism of the virus,” meaning it allows the virus to live and thrive in a much wider variety of human cells, including respiratory system cells. This means the virus lives in both respiratory cells and nerve cells.

Interestingly, the study further confirms that “ACE2” receptors are the vector of opportunity for the virus to infect human beings, stating, “ACE2 is also the receptor of the newly emerged nCoV.”

Additionally, the study finds that another element of the CoVid-19 virus appears to have been assembled from the SARS coronavirus, further confirming Frances Boyle’s claim that the engineered weapon is a “chimera” of multiple strains of biological weapons, including SARS, MERS and HIV. From the study: “Notably, the IFPs of the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are identical, displaying characteristics of viral fusion peptides (Fig. 2).”

Engineered to attack the human respiratory system, but there may be a defense… (you won’t like it)

The CoVid-19 coronavirus is specifically engineered to exploit the biology of the human respiratory system. Again, from the paper text:

Since furin is highly expressed in lungs, an enveloped virus that infects the respiratory tract may successfully exploit this convertase to activate its surface glycoprotein (Bassi et al., 2017; Mbikay et al., 1997). Before the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, this important feature was not observed in the lineage b of betacoronaviruses.

Finally, study authors explain that people who have already been exposed to other viral infections may have enhanced immunity against the coronavirus. From the study:

…it was recently shown that in an effort to limit viral infections, host cells that are infected by a number of viruses provoke an interferon response to inhibit the enzymatic activity of furin-like enzymes.

Although we caution that this supposition is just theory (so far), it may turn out that one way to boost defenses against the coronavirus could be to get infected with a weaker respiratory virus first. Stated another way, people who routinely interact with the public and are exposed to a wide variety of in-the-wild circulating viruses may be automatically building improved defenses by overcoming other viral infections first.

This finding has huge implications for individuals who take vaccines, given that vaccines expose the human body to weakened viral strains that often fail to provoke the full response of “in-the-wild” viruses such as seasonal influenza. Although the research did not focus on this point, it might also turn out that people who routinely take seasonal flu shots could theoretically demonstrate a weakened immune response against the coronavirus, while those who avoid flu shots and allow their own bodies to naturally fight the flu each year will show enhanced immunity against CoVid-19 coronavirus.

Or, arguably, it might work the other way around, where people who routinely take more vaccines and are exposed to a wider variety of weaker strains therefore have more capacity to produce an “interferon response.” It’s too early to tell, but it certainly seems to be the case that people who are rarely or never exposed to other viral pathogens may be far more vulnerable to this one.

Refer to the “Hygiene Hypothesis” for more ideas on the ramifications of this research.

There’s more research yet to come, and tomorrow we post the full transcript of the interview with Frances Boyle on the Alex Jones Show.

What if the cure for the coronavirus were as simple as taking zinc?,"(Natural News) It’s now looking increasingly clear that zinc may truly be the “silver bullet” for stopping coronavirus infections and ending this global pandemic. This mineral is incredibly affordable, safe and widely available, yet no one in government or media is recommending that people take zinc, since it can’t generate the billions in profits found in prescription drugs and vaccines.

This article isn’t a self-serving promotion, by the way. We don’t have any zinc products to sell. Rather, this article is about helping save lives using nutritional solutions that are available right now. While nothing is yet clinically proven to cure coronavirus — although chloroquine seems promising in several small trials — zinc now appears to be the most promising nutritional substance that could help end this global pandemic and get people back to work so that the economic collapse can be halted.

Chloroquine works hand in hand with zinc, driving zinc into cells

The combination of chloroquine and zinc appears to be especially potent. A study published in PLoS ONE is entitled, “Chloroquine is a Zinc Ionophore,” and it describes how chloroquine drives zinc into cancer cells, making those cells highly vulnerable to apoptosis (cell death of cancer cells). From the study:

Chloroquine enhanced zinc uptake by A2780 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as assayed using a fluorescent zinc probe. This enhancement was attenuated by TPEN, a high affinity metal-binding compound, indicating the specificity of the zinc uptake.

Although that study was focused on cancer cells, we also know that zinc blocks coronavirus RNA polymerase activity, which is what the coronavirus uses to replicate. This paper, published in another PLoS journal, specifically talks about “zinc ionophores” blocking the replication of coronavirus in cell cultures: “Zn(2+) inhibits coronavirus and arterivirus RNA polymerase activity in vitro and zinc ionophores block the replication of these viruses in cell culture.”

From the abstract of that study:

Increasing the intracellular Zn(2+) concentration with zinc-ionophores like pyrithione (PT) can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including poliovirus and influenza virus. For some viruses this effect has been attributed to interference with viral polyprotein processing. In this study we demonstrate that the combination of Zn(2+) and PT at low concentrations (2 µM Zn(2+) and 2 µM PT) inhibits the replication of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) in cell culture.

More specifically, Zn(2+) was found to block the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis, whereas in the case of the SARS-CoV RdRp elongation was inhibited and template binding reduced. By chelating Zn(2+) with MgEDTA, the inhibitory effect of the divalent cation could be reversed, which provides a novel experimental tool for in vitro studies of the molecular details of nidovirus replication and transcription.

So we know that chloroquine + zinc drives the zinc into cells, blocking coronavirus replication. This is published science, not just a random theory.

It is very likely, in our estimation, that most of the people dying from coronavirus are zinc deficient. We need to be testing the zinc levels in blood serum of coronavirus patients so we can gather all relevant data and confirm this pattern.

Symptoms of coronavirus infections almost perfectly mirror symptoms of zinc deficiency

Writing for LewRockwell.com, Bill Sardi writes that all the most prominent signs of COVID-19 almost perfectly mirror symptoms of zinc deficiency. From his article:

…[M]odern medicine is so steeped in its pharmacy of prescription drugs, with its blinders toward nutritional medicine, that it can’t see the obvious evidences of a trace mineral deficiency that results in the same signs and symptoms produced by COVID-19 coronavirus.

He publishes this list of COVID-19 symptoms vs. symptoms of zinc deficiency:

He further writes:

Dr. James Robb, a pathologist who performed early experiments with coronaviruses back in the 1970s, claims that zinc lozenges are the “silver bullet against coronavirus.”

Zinc is required to maintain thymus gland function to produce life-long antibodies from T-memory cells.

Zinc supplementation in the elderly, the high-risk group of coronavirus Infections, lowers illness markedly. Modern medicine needs to emphasize zinc therapy, especially during epidemics.

In summary, it looks like zinc might be the single most important preventive measure, possibly in combination with chloroquine, to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and get the economies of the world back to work.

And that’s why the tech giants (Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) as well as the corporate-run media will continue to censor all truth about zinc and chloroquine, because they actively hope to spread this pandemic and collapse the global economy.

The best forms of zinc to consume as a dietary supplement are zinc gluconate, picolinate and acetate, by the way. Avoid zinc oxide, as it’s almost impossible to absorb.

Beyond manufacturing medical masks and ventilators, we believe President Trump should order emergency production of zinc supplementation, making it widely available (perhaps at zero cost) to the entire population. This could substantially slow the spread of the virus and potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives in the USA alone.

United Airlines preparing to segregate passengers who do not submit to rapid covid-19 testing,"(Natural News) United Airlines is getting ready to enact mandatory covid-19 testing for some of their airlines, to see how far they can push passengers into giving up their civil liberties. With this authoritarian move, the airline industry is participating in medical fascism, forcing medical decisions on passengers and stealing away human consent.

The covid-19 testing kits have proven to be ineffective, providing both false negatives and false positives. The false negatives lead to a false sense of security, and the false positives allow authorities to suspend the civil liberties of healthy individuals only to bloat covid-19 statistics and report false outbreaks. This well-documented medical fraud is not relevant to health authorities because their power and authority is derived from compliance, not accurate data and scientific integrity. Compliance is all that matters when appeasing the hysterical fear that healthy people are spreading infections they do not have.

People who don’t consent to rapid covid-19 test will be segregated, treated as lesser human beings

From November 16 to December 11, United Airlines will require all crew members and passengers over two years of age to submit to rapid covid-19 tests for United Flight 14 leaving out of Newark Liberty International Airport and traveling to London Heathrow. (EWR to LHR), departing at 7:15 p.m., Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

The tests will be free of charge. Anyone who does not consent to the testing requirement will be segregated from the rest of the passengers and put on a separate flight, as if they are “dangerous” vectors of disease.

“We believe the ability to provide fast, same-day COVID-19 testing will play a vital role in safely reopening travel around the world and navigating quarantines and travel restrictions, particularly to key international destinations like London,” said Toby Enqvist, chief customer officer for United.

Enqvist continued: “Through this pilot program, we’ll guarantee that everyone* onboard has tested negative for COVID-19, adding another element to our layered approach to safety. United will continue to lead on testing, while at the same time exploring new solutions that contribute to the safest travel experience possible.”

United Airlines is trying to see how far the industry can push passengers into giving up their civil liberties, body autonomy and medical privacy before the airline industry goes all in with CommonPass.

United Airlines negotiating with governments to give them more control over individual body requirements

CommonPass is a digital, medical fascist passport that will soon be required for travel. This digital passport, scanned at the terminal, gives governments the power to force travelers to submit to bodily requirements so public health authorities can monitor an individual’s covid-19 testing status and compliance to vaccines and other medical edicts.

United Airlines is in the negotiating process with governments around the world to lift travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines. Both of these overzealous, authoritarian measures are being used improperly, not on sick individuals, but instead to suspend the liberties of healthy travelers who have no sign of infection.

In order to get their liberties back, travelers will be coerced to comply with medical requirements pre-departure, and be forced to submit to all the bodily requirements put forth by each government, which will be monitored and scanned using the CommonPass digital passport. But because covid-19 tests are designed to always produce false positives, this stripping of human rights and body autonomy will continue, until all people are forced to take vaccines in order to make airlines “safe.” It’s all part of a plan, which Natural News reported on this past June 2020: Airline industry pushing for medical testing, thermal screening, digital IDs and vaccination passports.

United Airlines is stripping human beings of informed consent and claiming ownership over their bodies. It started with mask mandates and it’s moving forward with faulty medical swabs – only to end with mandatory injections of experimental vaccines. Human beings are being turned into slaves of a totalitarian scientific dictatorship which continues to inflict mental, social and emotional trauma while coercing human compliance to bodily harm.

China is using the coronavirus pandemic to speed up its plans for global DOMINATION,"(Natural News) A U.K. minister of parliament party warning that the Chinese Communist Party will achieve global dominance sooner thanks to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). This warning was written by Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader of the Conservative Party.

In an op-ed in The Telegraph regarding China’s rising prominence, Duncan Smith lamented the fact that, while China was supposedly on the road to recovery, the U.K. was getting ready to reimpose strict lockdowns across swathes of their country.

The MP further noted that the U.K. isn’t alone in this regard. The coronavirus continues to wreak havoc across most of the developed world, particularly in Europe and the United States.

China has been a notable exception to this rule. If their official pronouncements are to be believed, they haven’t had to deal with a large-scale resurgence of the coronavirus in a very long time. (Related: Beijing using the coronavirus pandemic to expand internet surveillance apparatus.)

In fact, as many economies in the Western world are going through a recession, China just announced that its GDP grew by 4.9 percent in the third quarter, and analysts expect the country’s economy to grow by 7.6 percent in 2021.

“There is a deep sense of irony here,” wrote Duncan Smith. “The country from which coronavirus came, and which did so little in the early days to help the rest of the world escape its spread, is now bouncing back by selling us the equipment we need to combat that very virus.”

China set to dominate the world through trade

Despite predictions that the coronavirus pandemic – coupled with the ongoing trade war with the United States – would finally shatter China’s economy, the communist regime is still standing strong.

In the first two months of 2020, Chinese exports contracted by an astonishing 17.1 percent. However, As the coronavirus pandemic started spreading across the world and demand for medical equipment, personal protective gear and appliances for people to start working from home such as computers and smartphones increased, Chinese exports received an enormous boost.

Duncan Smith points out that the pandemic has given China a trade surplus of $58.93 billion. The country’s exports have been increasing since June, and the yuan – China’s currency – hit an 18-month high before the communist government intervened to keep it more stable.

Many investors in the West are once again lining up and give the communist regime more of their money. In the United States, investors just gave the regime $27 billion in China’s first U.S. direct investment bond. Foreign Direct Investment inflows now amount to around $103 billion.

“China’s export performance during the crisis is indeed proof of its solid status as the world’s factory,” said Yao Wei, a Chinese economist for French investment bank Societe Generale. “It is reliable, as the quick and effective containment of the outbreak in China allowed its manufacturing sector to resume operations way ahead of others.”

Economic warfare is not the only way China is achieving its global dominance. Within its own borders, Uighurs are being forced into reeducation camps to have their cultural identities extinguished, Tibetans are being forced into labor camps, Mongolians are being barred from learning their own language, and its democracy-loving subjects in Hong Kong are facing persecution.

Outside its borders, it is currently engaged in a tense struggle with India over their borders in the Himalayas region, and it continues to solidify its grip over the resource-rich South China Sea. All this is not even considering the military threats it makes against democratic Taiwan.

The Free World can still fight back against China’s rise

There is a chance for the rest of the Free World to catch up. China has lost much of its early trade advantage as soon as lockdowns started getting rolled back in its rival trading partners. Chi Lo, a Greater China economist for BNP Paribas, believes that China’s export growth can fade as soon as world production goes back up to normal levels.

The strength of its growth is already being challenged by geopolitical tensions. When the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co., the country had to increase its imports from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.

For China’s emerging global dominance to be properly counteracted, however, Duncan Smith says the Western world needs to act quickly. To do that, it needs to stop pouring money into the country. If countries like the U.K. and the U.S. continue to do so, they may one day find themselves “ever more dependent on this authoritarian regime.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping has a clear vision for the future of his country, said Duncan Smith. They plan to be the world’s leading superpower in terms of economic and military might by 2049 – at the centennial anniversary of the country’s founding.

“All the while, President Xi Jinping’s ambition grows and grows. While coronavirus has turned life upside down for people across the West, for China the most significant effect is that it will achieve global dominance even earlier than its communist rules had planned,” said Duncan Smith at the conclusion of his opinion piece. “The only remaining question – when will the West wake up?”

"WHO: Lockdowns not the primary method for fighting COVID-19, governments must develop “better systems” against pandemic","(Natural News) An increasing number of doctors and other health professionals and experts, including members of the World Health Organization (WHO), are joining the call to warn policymakers against reimposing restrictive lockdowns. These medical professionals argue that the lockdowns do more harm than good in the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

During an interview with The Spectator aired on Oct. 9, WHO doctor and special envoy on COVID-19 David Nabarro said that the WHO no longer advocates using lockdowns as a primary means of keeping the coronavirus under control.

WATCH: Dr David Nabarro, the WHO's Special Envoy on Covid-19, tells Andrew Neil: 'We really do appeal to all world leaders: stop using lockdown as your primary control method'. Watch the full interview here: https://t.co/XLdaedsKVS #SpectatorTV @afneil | @davidnabarro pic.twitter.com/1M4xf3VnXQ — The Spectator (@spectator) October 9, 2020

“The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted,” said Nabarro during the online interview. “But by and large, we’d rather not do it.”

In an appeal to world leaders, Nabarro said that they need to stop using coronavirus lockdowns as their primary method of controlling the pandemic. “Develop better systems for [controlling the virus],” he said. “Work together and learn from each other. But remember – lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer.” (Related: No, “coronavirus” hasn’t thrown 100 million into extreme poverty… virus LOCKDOWNS did that.)

“I want to say it again: We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means of controlling this virus.”

Nabarro: War on COVID-19 will not be won by controlling people

In a different interview, this time with BBC 4, Nabarro warned the U.K. government against imposing another strict coronavirus lockdown. The WHO doctor argued that for the lockdown to work, the restrictions on social and economic activity cannot be forced upon the British people. These policies need to be popularly supported.

“This war – and I think it’s reasonable to call it a war – against the virus, which is going to go on for the foreseeable future, is not going to be won by creating tougher rules that attempt to control people’s behavior,” said Nabarro. “The only way that we will come out ahead of this virus is if we’re all able to do the right thing in the right place at the right time because we choose to do it.”

Nabarro believes that, without making it mandatory, people will one day come together and realize the importance of social distancing, the wearing of face masks, personal hygiene and quarantining when they get flu-like symptoms.

Nabarro’s current position on coronavirus lockdowns represents a radical shift from his previous statements. He has previously advocated for lockdowns. However, by September, he had moved to a more neutral position, arguing in front of the British parliament that the world was still at the beginning stages of the pandemic and that it will still take some time for health experts to properly understand how to fight it. By this point, he was arguing that lockdowns should not be discounted as a tactic.

However, in recent weeks, he said he has become “more and more convinced” that, despite the possible benefits to defeating the spread of the coronavirus, the economic and social consequences were too much for the world to bear.

Watch this episode of Brighteon Conversations with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he talks to Dr. Sherri Tenpenny as they both sound off against the stupidity of making the wearing of face masks mandatory.

There are alternatives to continual lockdowns

To understand the right way to fight back against the coronavirus, Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, says leaders should look to the example of countries that have successfully defeated it, such as Vietnam, Taiwan and New Zealand.

In Taiwan and New Zealand, sporting events are being held without any restrictions. In Vietnam, people can enter packed cafes and restaurants without fear.

In Vietnam and New Zealand, coronavirus lockdowns were decisive and quick. In Taiwan, a large-scale lockdown was never imposed upon the people. Yet, between these three countries, only 67 people have died from the coronavirus so far.

Sridhar has identified three key policies that governments need to put in place.

First, there needs to be an effective system for testing, tracing and isolating. Test results need to be returned within 24 hours to minimize the damage one person can do. There must be a proper system for contact tracing, with the goal of reaching at least 80 percent of a positive person’s recent contacts. People who test positive must also be isolated for at least 14 days, either at their own homes or at designated shelters.

Second, national health authorities need to act rationally and communicate their policies clearly, emphasizing encouraging personal hygiene and the wearing of face masks (without mandating it) and avoiding leaving the house as much as possible.

Lastly, governments need strict border protection. The coronavirus can be imported from overseas, and only strong border policies will be able to prevent that.

Top 5 Ways to HEIGHTEN your chances of catching Covid-19,"(Natural News) The science is in, and if you’re not already pretty much dying from cancer, diabetes or heart disease, then you probably aren’t going to die if you catch Covid-19. If you subtract all the deaths that were labeled Covid-caused that were not caused by Covid, what you’re left with is another viral flu, that went viral all around the world, killing off the already sick and dying. There’s no number we’ll ever see statistically that’s accurate, but many people who were labeled Covid death victims really died from MRSA, pneumonia, the flu, cancer, diabetes, heart attacks, strokes and of course, suicide. Yes, you can blame the fake news press for those. Wait, there’s more.

Besides all of those victims and non-victims of Covid, we are all told to think of the others, to be safe and wear a homemade bandana mask everywhere, maintain social distance of exactly 6 feet at all times, and only gather together if rioting in the streets to declare our hatred of Donald J. Trump. Otherwise, stay home, go broke and beg (vote) for a government that gives you everything for free, while removing forever all of your Constitutional rights.

It’s rather ironic that there’s “no cure” for a virus that can be killed by hand sanitizer and regular soap. In this rush to return to “normal” we should all consider very carefully what parts of normal we’re rushing back to. Nobody anywhere seems to have any common sense whatsoever. They’re acting like they’re being totally safe on one end, and on the other, the virus is having a free-for-all, penetrating the magical force field everyone thinks they’ve got erected. Like, don’t bring your own bag to the grocery store, but then the clerk touches every single item you just touched to put in the cart.

Think about this for a minute. There are 200 million Americans who get the flu shot every year, and get juiced up accordingly with deadly, brain-numbing mercury all the while. That’s just the beginning of why most people have zero common sense. Then, they eat what they see advertised on TV and the internet, with no regard to actual nutritional content or food that’s free from chemical herbicides and insecticides (plus GMOs). We’re talking about weed killer and bug killer chemicals that eviscerate the human immune system, repeatedly every single meal, snack and soda.

After a few years of that, they’re bound for their M.D.’s office, where they’re carefully and so thoughtfully prescribed chemical medications that solve nothing, except to quell the symptoms of a deep-rooted disease that’s festering in the gut, soon to travel through the lymph fluid to everywhere vital in the body. Those laboratory-concocted medications often come in the form of antibiotics, that wipe out all gut bacteria (good and bad), setting up the patient for death from a viral infection, like Covid, the flu, or certain kinds of MRSA staph-bacteria that are totally immune to antibiotics.

And, there’s more.

Filthy, bacteria-laden Covid masks are bad, bad news

The Covid masks everybody wears become filthy after a few days, trapping bacteria from the mouth and lungs in the body and in the material of the mask. Who’s washing these bacteria nets regularly, and who even realizes that the Covid virus is only 2 microns in size, where the holes in most masks are 3 to 5 microns. That’s like throwing a tennis ball through a basketball hoop. The masks don’t even work, in fact, they’re just delivering a cozy-safe feeling that enables more people to expose themselves even more. Oops.

In fact, according to a recent, in-depth study of Covid mask effectiveness, the penetration of cloth masks by particles was above 96 percent, compared to 44 percent with medical masks. That means not even medical masks are all that safe, let alone these crappy home-made, double-ply cut up sheets, scarves and ‘neck gaiters’ people are all wearing. And then they touch the mask repeatedly every minute to adjust it, rendering it not just useless, but now dangerous as well. There goes that safety net. It’s now a bacteria net.

The whole social distancing thing is a sham too. Also ironic is the fact that every vaccine pusher and fanatic has screamed for decades about herd immunity and how we should all stick together to help build immunity, but now everyone’s on lock down, where they don’t even get fresh air and exposure to bacteria they need to build immunity. It’s all backwards and inside out, just like the Democrats want it (yes, it’s political too, mainly actually).

The worst part of the whole mental “pandemic” is that the 200 million idiots who get a flu shot every year don’t know a darned thing about supplements, herbs, tinctures, superfoods, clean food or highly effective indigenous medicine. Their quack M.D.s warn them about natural remedies. They discourage them. It’s all about slash and burn allopathic nightmares that only stave off the inevitable. Surgery, tests, more tests, then chemotherapy and radiation. It’s “your best chance,” they say. At what? Dying from Covid?

Without further adieu, here are the Top 5 Ways to literally INCREASE your chances of catching Covid-19

#1. If you’re dumb enough to get a flu shot (or any CDC-recommended dirty vaccines for that matter)

#2. If you’re dumb enough to eat genetically modified food most meals (and processed sugar/canola oil)

#3. If your doctor cons you into taking antibiotic prescriptions for a viral infection

#4. If you think wearing is mask and social distancing is valid protection

#5. If you don’t supplement with vitamin D, vitamin C and zinc, especially as cold weather arrives

Airlines and transport officials CLASH with CDC over quarantines for airline passengers,"(Natural News) Airline companies and U.S. transport officials are clashing with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding whether people who test negative for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) should still be forced to quarantine after they arrive in the U.S.

Currently, official guidelines state that U.S. residents returning from Europe are advised – but not forced – to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return to the United States. European travelers are generally denied entry. Alternatively, Americans are barred from traveling to most European countries, with the notable exception being the United Kingdom, which forces them to quarantine for 14 days upon their arrival.

These guidelines are now being questioned as airlines, industry groups and senior transport officials look to strike deals with other nations and airline companies to establish what is known as a “safe-travel corridor.” This would involve two connected locations where people can fly to and from without needing to quarantine upon arrival.

CDC wants to maintain quarantines, but shorten their length

The CDC s arguing that, even if a safe-travel corridor was established between two cities, people should still be required to quarantine. That said, they’ve relented somewhat, and now only want to mandate that travelers be quarantined for between five to seven days, rather than 14. After the self-isolation period, however, the CDC still wants these travelers to take another coronavirus test.

Industry groups and senior transport officials, on the other hand, are pushing back on the need for further quarantining and testing.

“Quarantines don’t help achieve the goal of safe travel,” said industry group Airlines for America in a statement. “Rather, quarantines simply stop people from traveling or are not complied with.” (Related: In order to travel, you’ll soon be forced to carry a digital certificate that provides proof of medical checkups, screenings, DNA swabs, vaccinations.)

Airlines and other industry groups are pushing for an alternative system where travelers will be tested for the coronavirus before departure and will be signed up for a contact tracing system. One airline trade group is supportive of a 24-hour isolation period.

Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC’s division of global migration and quarantine, is one of the loudest voices calling for a one-week quarantine upon arrival. This, Cetron argues, would give the U.S. a 90 percent assurance that travelers will be coronavirus-free.

Despite his opposition to more relaxed rules for travelers, Cetron has nonetheless voiced his support for the establishment of a safe-travel corridor. He believes that it may one day contribute “to a safe, responsible and healthy global air travel experience, in addition to testing before and after travel and following public health recommendations on self-quarantine after travel.”

Discussions with the CDC are ongoing, and senior transport officials are attempting to mediate the dispute and find a common ground between the two parties.

Transport officials are hoping to resolve the disagreement very soon, as both the United States and the United Kingdom are currently in talks to establish a safe-travel corridor between London and New York. Officials from the Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security hope to open the corridor by the winter holidays.

Study suggests flying safer than grocery shopping or dining in restaurants

The CDC’s apprehensions with allowing the establishment of safe-travel corridors may be unfounded. A study released on Tuesday by the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health strongly suggests that flying may be safer than grocery shopping or dining indoors.

Researchers created computer models to simulate airflow in airliner cabins. According to them, the specialized onboard ventilation systems – known as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters – are able to filter out 99 percent of airborne particles, including those bearing viruses.

The researchers argued that, even if an airplane’s ventilation systems sucked in particles with COVID-19, the fact that they go through HEPA filters and because of the “downward direction” of airflow makes it unlikely a passenger will infect others.

“This ventilation effectively counters the proximity travelers are subject to during flights,” wrote the researchers in their report.

That said, the report also says that ventilation systems alone cannot guarantee a 99 percent reduction in risk. Effective air ventilation needs to be coupled with the wearing of face masks, regular disinfection and passenger screening for COVID-19 symptoms.

This “layered approach” makes flying safer than other routine activities, such as dining indoors in restaurants and grocery shopping.

The airline industry is already interpreting the study as a sign of relief, as they continue to face devastating losses from the pandemic and the lockdowns around the world making air travel impossible. Executives from United Airlines have already called the pandemic “the worst crisis in the history of aviation.”

The study is in line with another study conducted by the Department of Defense, who put particle detection equipment and mannequins wearing face masks on Boeing 767 and 777 aircraft. They found little risk of transmission, thanks in no small part to the efficient ventilation of air in the planes.

Big Tech now censoring all posts that question face coverings,"(Natural News) At the request of Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), the three major tech platforms – Facebook, Google and Twitter – will now be censoring all posts and content that questions the safety and effectiveness of the almighty face mask.

A full-fledged believer in the power of face masks to cure the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), Duckworth wants Big Tech to “counter domestic disinformation that spreads the dangerous lies such as ‘masks don’t work’” by preventing it from being shared online.

In other words, face masks are so safe and effective, according to Duckworth, that people cannot be allowed to express any free speech to the contrary because it might deter people from putting their faith in the religion of COVID-19.

Duckworth’s attack on the First Amendment comes as Silicon Valley faces yet another meaningless grilling from Congress over the immunity protections it still maintains under Section 230 of the antiquated Communications Decency Act (CDA).

Congress continues to pretend as though it will eventually do something to curb Big Tech from infringing people’s rights, but so far it has been all talk and no action, also known as business as usual, from the political overlords.

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Ill.) put on a lively show, however, as he sparred with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey concerning the platform’s unfair treatment of conservatives. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) also joined in on the fun by yelling at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.

“Who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear?” Cruz bellowed during the virtual hearing over Zoom.

“We don’t have a general policy around misleading information and misinformation,” Dorsey responded. “We rely upon people calling that speech out.”

In other words, Twitter does not actually have a standardized set of rules for what it censors, but rather relies on mob rule to make censorship decisions.

Is it really realistic to expect that Congress will ever put an end to Big Tech censorship?

President Donald Trump is also riling up his base about the topic by tweeting about it, ironically. Trump wrote in an Oct. 28 tweet that the media and Big Tech “are not covering Biden Corruption.

Trump added that the United States no longer has “Freedom of the Press,” but rather “Suppression of the Story, or just plain Fake News.”

“So much has been learned in the last two weeks about how corrupt our Media is, and now Big Tech, maybe [sic] even worse. Repeal Section 230!”

Again, we will believe it when we see it because this has been getting talked about for years by Republicans, which have collectively and individually done a whole lot of nothing to punish the tech giants for violating the First Amendment.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) did recently file an antitrust lawsuit against Google, however, the subject of that suit is monopolistic, anticompetitive behavior as opposed to censorship.

When asked during the hearing if he plans to censor content on Facebook post-election that encourages violence, Mark Zuckerberg made the claim that “there are no exceptions” to its censorship rules, even if politicians break them.

“The three witnesses we have before this committee collectively pose, I believe, the single greatest threat to free speech in America and the greatest threat we have to free and fair elections,” Cruz went on to declare during the circus event.

Dorsey reluctantly responded to Cruz’s statements by suggesting that Twitter does “need to earn more trust” from the public, adding that “more accountability is needed” to create the illusion that Twitter supports free speech.

Those who call the coronavirus a “hoax” are making a huge mistake: These twelve questions reveal the TRUTH that no one dare utter,"(Natural News) There’s no question that elements of the coronavirus pandemic are being wildly exaggerated by mostly left-leaning mayors, governors and media pundits in order to punish America with economically destructive lockdowns (all in the hope of removing Trump from office, it turns out). We’ve even documented one of the most egregious deception efforts involving the Florida Dept. of Health, which has been rigging lab reports to claim 100% of those tested are “positive” for covid-19.

But it’s a mistake to leap to the conclusion that because left-wing operators hope to exaggerate the infections, hospitalizations and deaths that therefore the entire pandemic is a complete hoax and no one is dying from the coronavirus. That’s where the thinking is dangerously misguided and is already leading to complacency. Yet the idea that the entire coronavirus pandemic might be a hoax is a seductive one, especially on alternative platforms or conservative media, where it’s convenient to explain away all the economic damage as stemming from an elaborate hoax rather than to understand the complexities of a real pandemic augmented by fake news from the Left.

From Brighteon.com videos to InfoWars broadcasts, we repeatedly hear many people in independent media claiming the coronavirus is a “hoax.” There is no virus, they say, and all the infections, hospitalizations and deaths have all been faked, they claim. It’s all a grand, global theatrical production involving hundreds of thousands of nurses, doctors and coroners, all to trick the world into lockdowns that have no real justification, they tell us. This has become the dominant narrative in alt media.

But if that’s true, then how can there be a media cover-up regarding hydroxychloroquine, an off-patent, low-cost drug that successfully treats and cures coronavirus patients? If there’s no coronavirus, then what is hydroxychloroquine treating?

It’s easy to find reports of deaths being improperly attributed to covid-19, or even stories of false positives incorrectly flagging people with covid-19 when they really don’t have it. But the logic leap that many in the alternative media have taken is assuming that since some deaths were faked, therefore ALL deaths must have been faked.

Many of the same independent media sources that are reporting the coronavirus to be a “hoax” also reported on how Obama’s NIH, under Dr. Fauci, directed millions of dollars to the Wuhan virology lab to fund “gain-of-function” research. If the coronavirus is a hoax, and there is no coronavirus, then isn’t the Obama / Fauci / NIH story also completely bogus?

In fact, there are at least a dozen serious questions or contradictions that those who claim the coronavirus is a hoax can’t answer. Much of their reporting has been self-contradicting to the point where believing their news requires that you alternatively embrace the existence of the virus or denounce the virus as fake… depending on the day of the week.

But the coronavirus can’t be real on Monday, fake on Tuesday, real again on Wednesday and so on. Any explanation of coronavirus-related observations must, above all, deliver consistency. Unless, of course, you believe in transviralism, where viruses can magically pop into existence as easily as a biological man claiming he’s a woman so he can compete on the women’s college wrestling team.

For the record, we have consistently understood the coronavirus to be a very real threat, and we haven’t wavered from day one. While we acknowledge that much of the coronavirus testing is highly inaccurate — and hundreds of testing facilities seem to be deliberately finding all test to be “positive” in their results — even all that fraud doesn’t mean the coronavirus isn’t really impacting other people.

These questions and contradictions must be addressed by anyone who wants to be taken seriously

In watching the coverage of this issue by others, we’ve noticed twelve questions or contradictions that have repeatedly surfaced. See the full list below, and ask yourself this important question as you read through the list: Do logic and reason still apply in our universe?

Just as the radical Left claims biological sex doesn’t exist and a man can become a woman at any moment by making a wish, much of the conservative, independent media has an eerily similar view about the coronavirus, alternately claiming it’s either real or fake depending on what story they want to cover on that particular day.

Obviously, men can’t become women, and men can’t have babies. In the same way, the coronavirus can’t be both real and fake at the same time. So which is it?

Read the questions and decide for yourself:

Twelve questions for those who claim the coronavirus is a hoax

Question #1) Many in the alternative media reported on the New York City nurse who filmed undercover video and blew the whistle on how NYC hospitals were killing patients by rooming non-infected patients with coronavirus-infected patients, allowing transmission to occur. But how can non-infected patients be killed by the coronavirus if the coronavirus is a hoax?

Question #2) Alternative media outlets that are currently reporting the coronavirus to be a “hoax” are also reporting on how the mainstream media lied and covered up the story of how hydroxychloroquine can effectively and affordably treat coronavirus patients. If the coronavirus is a hoax, then what exactly is hydroxychloroquine treating, then?

Question #3) Many in the independent media are now pushing “mask hysteria” and claiming that wearing a mask causes death by asphyxiation or carbon dioxide poisoning. Yet Asian cultures — Taiwan, Japan, China, Korea, Singapore, etc. — have been wearing masks in public for decades, without a single recorded event of someone dying from wearing a mask. Surgeons wear masks during surgery without passing out, and masks are routinely worn by construction workers to filter particular matter such as sawdust, drywall dust and paint. If these masks have been safe and effective for more than fifty years, how did masks suddenly and magically become deadly and toxic in the last three months? Did the laws of physics change?

Question #4) Coronavirus pandemic skeptics claim all the infections and deaths are faked. But if all the deaths are faked, then why did those who are faking the deaths decide to keep dropping the daily death numbers from mid April through the end of June? If they’re faking all the deaths, then wouldn’t they want to keep faking more and more of them to make the pandemic look worse and worse? Why would they fake fewer deaths over time?

Question #5) Many independent media outlets that originally reported the coronavirus was a “genetically engineered biological weapon” designed to depopulate the planet are now reporting it’s all a hoax. But then they simultaneously report that Obama’s NIH, under Dr. Fauci, directed money to the Wuhan virology lab that built the weapon in the first place. If the coronavirus is a hoax, then there’s no story about Obama and Fauci funding a biological weapon “gain of function” program in China. How can both be true?

Question #6) In June, it was widely reported across the independent media that coronavirus infections caused the body’s cells to “sprout tentacles” that allowed the virus to attack adjacent cells and infect them. This was widely reported as more evidence that the virus was a genetically engineered biological weapon. As an example of the coverage, Zero Hedge reported:

“There are long strings that poke holes in other cells and the virus passes through the tube from cell to cell,” said UCSF’s Director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute, Professor Nevan Krogan. “Our hypothesis is that these speed up infection.”

So how can the coronavirus sprout “tentacles” if it doesn’t exist and is a total hoax?

Question #7: As Gary Heaven recently wrote in a Natural News article about coronavirus treatments that work, the common inhaler anti-inflammatory drug budesonide works extremely well to treat and cure covid-19 infections. A well-known doctor, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has been actively promoting the treatment as an alternative to expensive Big Pharma drugs and vaccines, proving that he’s not a pawn of the drug cartels:

If budesonide successfully treats patients who have covid-19, curing them and allowing them to leave the hospital and return to normal life, then what is budesonide treating if the coronavirus is a hoax? How can anyone simultaneously claim the coronavirus is a hoax and also claim the media is suppressing cures that work to treat it?

Question #8) Coronavirus skeptics explain that coronavirus deaths are faked in the United States because hospitals receive extra funding for every death that’s considered coronavirus-related. Thus, people who die from other causes are said to have died from coronavirus so that hospitals can receive extra funds from Medicare. But Medicare doesn’t pay hospitals in Italy, Brazil, Mexico or Russia, and the same financial incentives don’t exist in most countries. So how do you explain all the dead bodies in Guayaquil, Ecuador? Or the skyrocketing death rates in Brazil? Or the massive die-offs in Italy, where it would have been impossible to recruit thousands of doctors and nurses to participate in a grand false flag theatrical production?

Question #9) If the initial lockdowns didn’t work, then why did coronavirus daily deaths plummet soon after the lockdowns went into effect? And why are coronavirus deaths now beginning to surge back a few weeks after the lockdowns were relaxed? If the doctors, nurses, hospitals and coroners wanted to fake all the deaths, wouldn’t they want to keep faking more deaths, not fewer deaths?

Question #10) For months, we’ve been told by the independent media that “fear” is the problem, and that those talking about coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths were “pushing fear.” They said things like, “We need to flatten the fear curve,” and urged complete calm for everyone. Not long after, they turned around the told everybody you should be terrified of masks. So if “fear” is the enemy here, then why push fear about masks? Will all these same media pundits also tell us that children shouldn’t wear masks this Halloween and claim that children will drop dead all across America if they put on masks?

Question #11) If the coronavirus isn’t real, then why are many publishers who claim the pandemic is a “hoax” also telling people to take vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc and anti-viral supplements? Obviously, if the pandemic is fake, there’s no need to protect yourself from it. So why recommend immune-boosting supplements in the first place?

Question #12) If masks are so dangerous and kill people, then why are so many pro-liberty people perfectly fine with wearing Guy Fawkes masks? What about Halloween masks?

If we are to deal with the very real coronavirus pandemic — which was deliberately set into motion by China, using a genetically engineered virus that was clearly weaponized to kill human beings — we must have the critical thinking skills to filter out the fake news exaggerations without succumbing to an emotional knee-jerk reaction of declaring the entire thing doesn’t exist.

Daily deaths in the United States are now on the upswing, with Texas achieving an all-time record high in daily deaths just yesterday. Even if the infection testing is obviously bogus, how do you account for the sharp increase in deaths? And if your answer is that “all the deaths are being faked,” then you have to ask yourself why Texas wasn’t faking just as many deaths in April, May and June. Why suddenly in the middle of July? Texas isn’t a “pro-lockdown” state, either.

Then again, the result of the complacency wasn’t difficult to see coming. Back in April, I publicly predicted that June and July would be “complacency” months, followed by a second wave in August if people didn’t take this pandemic seriously.

Even though the Case Fatality Rate appears to be slowly dropping, rising complacency is exposing so many people to the infections that daily deaths are on track to continue rising for quite some time.

It now looks like August and September and on track to see a sharp surge in hospitalizations and deaths, even as mostly conservative publishers continue to claim the coronavirus isn’t even real.

Refrigerated trucks brought into Texas and Arizona to deal with all the dead bodies

“Texas and Arizona are bringing in refrigerated trucks to expand morgue capacity in several counties across each state, after the number of coronavirus fatalities shattered records this week,” reports Fox News. “Reuters reported that San Antonio and Bexar County each received five refrigerated trailers to store up to 180 bodies as some hospital morgues and funeral homes have reached capacity.”

Is this all staged, too? Does anyone seriously believe counties and cities in Texas are faking refrigerated trucks as some sort of elaborate theater to make a grand hoax more convincing?

And if the number of deaths occurring in these places were simply “normal,” then the morgues wouldn’t be overrun in the first place. So no, this isn’t just people dying from regular causes magically being switched and labeled as “covid-19 deaths.”

Clearly, more people are dying than usual. Via Fox News:

The Office of the Medical Examiner said it is currently at 63 percent morgue capacity but has brought in 14 cold storage containers– eight being held at the County facility and six more in reserve– that would allow an additional 294 decedents by the end of next week “if necessary,” Fields Moseley, a spokesperson for Maricopa County, told Fox News.

“We know some funeral homes are already at capacity in their morgues, so we want to be prepared in case we have to keep bodies for a longer period of time,” Moseley said.

Anyone calling the coronavirus a hoax is a fool, and this is about to become increasingly apparent over the next 3-4 months as the path of the coronavirus continues to follow almost exactly what I publicly predicted in April. It also means that you can expect a wave of lockdowns to continue to spread across America as hospitalizations and deaths accelerate.

We could have stopped this entire thing with zinc, vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine and wearing masks in public places. But instead, America has become so stupid and irrational that, instead, we are going to endure a devastating second wave of deaths and lockdowns that will probably devastate our economy and end in the total collapse of the United States of America.

Hybrid virus developed by scientists claims to make coronavirus research “safer”,"(Natural News) Studying the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) has been difficult due to how infectious the virus is and the need to keep researchers safe. To work around this, scientists have developed a virus that acts just like the coronavirus but doesn’t cause severe disease.

Currently, any laboratory research of SARS-CoV-2 – the pathogen behind COVID-19 – requires a high level of biosafety. Researchers work inside laboratories with multiple containment levels and specialized ventilation systems, all while wearing bulky full-body biohazard suits with pressurized respirators.

While necessary, these safety measures limit who can research the coronavirus to those labs that can afford the necessary equipment. This slows down efforts to find medicines and cures for the virus.

“Hybrid” virus created to make research safer

To allow researchers and institutions who don’t have access to the necessary biosafety equipment to contribute to the fight against the coronavirus, researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have created a new “hybrid” virus that infects cells and interacts with antibodies just like how the SARS-CoV-2 does. Unlike the latter, however, this new virus does not cause any severe illness.

The researchers used another virus, called a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as a base for the new hybrid virus. VSV is a workhorse in virology labs since it’s easy to manipulate genetically while, at the same time, being fairly innocuous. The virus primarily infects animals such as horses, cattle and pigs. When it does occasionally infect people, it only causes a mild, flu-like illness that lasts from three to five days.

Aside from being less deadly, one of the main differences between VSV and SARS-CoV-2 is how they infect cells. While viruses in general use proteins on their surface to attack cells, the latter uses what scientists have dubbed a “spike” protein.

To create the hybrid virus then, the scientists removed VSV’s surface protein gene and replaced it with the one from SARS-CoV-2. The resulting hybrid, dubbed VSV-SARS-CoV-2, has the coronavirus’ spike protein, allowing it to target cells in the same manner, but lacks the genes needed to cause severe illness.

Once they had the new virus, they tested it against antibodies from COVID-19 survivors. The test shows that the antibodies reacted to the hybrid virus in the same way that they did against the real SARS-CoV-2 virus. At the same time, antibodies that worked against the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 also worked against SARS-CoV-2. (Related: Most coronavirus patients develop “neutralizing antibodies” after recovery, but are they enough to head off another infection?)

“Humans certainly develop antibodies against other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but it’s the antibodies against spike that seem to be most important for protection,” said co-senior author Dr. Sean Whelan. “So as long as a virus has the spike protein, it looks to the human immune system like SARS-CoV-2, for all intents and purposes.”

New virus will supposedly accelerate the development of treatments

According to the team, this new hybrid virus could help more scientists evaluate a range of preventative treatments for COVID-19 that are based on neutralizing antibodies.

“One of the problems in evaluating neutralizing antibodies is that a lot of these tests require a BSL-3 facility, and most clinical labs and companies don’t have BSL-3 facilities,” explained Dr. Michael S. Diamond, co-senior author of the study.

“With this surrogate virus, you can take serum, plasma or antibodies and do high-throughput analyses at BSL-2 levels, which every lab has, without a risk of getting infected. And we know that it correlates almost perfectly with the data we get from bona fide infectious SARS-CoV-2,” he added.

According to Diamond, the hybrid virus could be used to test to see where or not an experimental vaccine triggers the creation of neutralizing antibodies, to measure whether a COVID-19 survivor carries enough of these antibodies to donate plasma to other COVID-19 patients or even identify if any antibodies have the potential to be developed into antiviral medicines.

In addition to being useful for expanding research on SARS-CoV-2, the fact that the hybrid virus has the same spike protein as the latter and triggers the same antibodies means that it could possibly also be used as a vaccine. According to Diamond, he and his colleagues are already conducting animal studies to evaluate the possibility.

Whether or not the hybrid VSV-SARS-CoV-2 virus can be effective as a vaccine is another matter altogether.

Vaccines work by using a virus, or something similar to it, to trigger the immune system to the production of antibodies against it. Studies have shown, however, that antibodies the body produces to fight SARS-CoV-2 tend to fade after just a few months. This means that the immunity provided by any COVID-19 vaccine – not just that based on the hybrid virus – will likely not last for long.

"UK study shows COVID-19 antibodies fade quickly, rendering vaccines pointless","(Natural News) COVID-19 has proven time and time again that it’s unlike any other illness society has faced, and a new study shows that preventing the disease is going to be incredibly challenging, as infections do not give people long-term immunity to the disease as many had hoped.

This is according to a study that was recently carried out by London’s Guy’s and St. Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust. The researchers studied the immune response in patients with the disease and found that the antibodies they developed decreased within a few weeks after the onset of symptoms. This means that people could well become reinfected after recovering from the illness.

According to the study, 23 days after the symptoms first appeared in patients, 60 percent experienced a potent antibody response; 65 days later, just 16.7 percent had this response. Antibodies are the proteins your body makes to fight off an infection. If there is any silver lining here, it’s the fact that those who had a more severe infection enjoyed an antibody response that was stronger and lasted longer.

The study looked at 59 patients who had tested positive for the disease, the majority of whom were men. Researchers collected sequential serum samples from the patients from one day to 94 days after their symptoms first appeared. They also looked at 31 healthcare workers who volunteered to undergo regular antibody tests.

The researchers noted that the antibody response to COVID-19 that they found was similar to that seen in other types of human coronaviruses, such seasonal coronaviruses linked to the common cold and SARS. In these viruses, a person’s antibody response tends to fade for a period of time that can be as little as 12 weeks or as long as 34 months after infection.

This study isn’t just bad news for those who have suffered from the disease and are hoping to avoid a repeat; it also indicates that coming up with a vaccine could be complicated, if not impossible. Even those with severe infections who enjoyed longer antibody responses still saw those effects fading within just a few months. That could mean, at the very least, that if a vaccine is developed, it will need to be administered frequently.

Dr. Mala Maini, a virus expert from University College London, told CNN that the study “suggests vaccines will need to be better at inducing high levels of longer-lasting antibodies than the natural infection or that doses may need to be repeated to maintain immunity.”

Other studies show similar antibody issues

The U.K. study is just the latest evidence that getting infected with COVID-19 doesn’t mean people can let their guard down. A study from Spain found that just five percent of the population there had coronavirus antibodies despite experiencing a significant outbreak this spring. Moreover, their immunity to the disease faded after just a few weeks. This means that 95 percent of the country’s population is still susceptible to the virus.

The study, which took place from April to June, encompassed more than 61,000 participants, making it the largest study of its kind to date in Europe.

The study also concluded that the antibodies in Spain’s population were not sufficient to provide herd immunity, which occurs when a population is allowed a certain amount of exposure to the virus to build up immunity among the general population.

Meanwhile, a study out of China that compared the antibody responses of 37 symptomatic patients with 37 asymptomatic people found that those who did not have symptoms experienced a weaker antibody response than those who did have symptoms.

Many people have already expressed concerns about the potential side effects of a rushed COVID-19 vaccine, but that may be a moot point if the vaccine is incapable of providing people with immunity to the disease in the first place.

Another study shows how quickly COVID-19 antibodies disappear,"(Natural News) When the coronavirus crisis first began, there was a lot of hope that at least those who survive the disease will develop immunity to it and won’t have to worry about catching it again. However, it has become painfully apparent that it doesn’t work that way at all. In fact, a trio of studies that have been released recently illustrate just how fleeting the immunity offered by coronavirus antibodies truly is.

The newest study comes out of London, where COVID-19 patients’ immune responses were analyzed. The researchers discovered that the levels of antibodies that could kill the virus dropped quickly after peaking a few weeks after the patients first exhibited symptoms. At the peak of their battle against the disease, 60 percent of the patients had a “potent” antibody response; two months later, however, only 16.7 percent of them had such a response.

For some patients, the antibody response against the virus went on to become undetectable. The study’s lead author, Katie Doores, said that although people are producing reasonable antibody responses to the virus, that response is fading quickly.

Meanwhile, a large study carried out in Spain showed that antibodies disappear just weeks after people test positive for the disease, deflating hopes for the possibility of attaining herd immunity. Herd immunity occurs when enough of the population becomes immune to a certain disease, either by already getting sick or through vaccines, to make it unlikely to spread throughout the community. The study, which was published in the journal Lancet, found that 14 percent of those who tested positive for antibodies did not have any antibodies just weeks later.

The study involved more than 60,000 participants, who answered questionnaires about symptoms and were given antibody and blood tests.

The report stated: “At present, herd immunity is difficult to achieve without accepting the collateral damage of many deaths in the susceptible population and overburdening of health systems.”

A different study, this one from China, found that antibodies faded quickly in people with COVID-19 symptoms and asymptomatic patients alike. The scientists found that more than 90 percent of people in both groups experienced deep declines in their antibody levels two to three months after the onset of their infection. Among the asymptomatic group, 40 percent tested negative for antibodies just eight weeks after being released from isolation.

Vaccines aren’t the answer

Of course, it goes without saying that if antibodies do disappear this quickly, any vaccine that is developed would have to be administered repeatedly throughout the year if people wanted to gain any amount of protection whatsoever. Most people don’t want to get even one vaccine, much less various shots throughout the year.

Making matters even more complicated is the fact that even if a coronavirus patient does develop antibodies, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they will have any immunity at all. Writing for CNN, Dr. William Haseltine said: “Only 15 percent of those who test positive for antibodies make the neutralizing antibodies necessary to develop immunity.”

Unfortunately, it looks like COVID-19 is much like many other types of coronavirus. The antibodies for other common coronaviruses generally disappear completely within somewhere between four months and a year, which is why people can catch the same one every year.

Vaccines may not offer much protection from the disease after all, and their long-term effects will be largely untested as they are rushed to the market. These studies underscore the importance of preventing the disease naturally. Wear a mask when you’ll be around others, and don’t forget that washing your hands frequently remains essential. One of the best lines of defense is keeping your immune system up. Eat a healthy and well-balanced diet, and make sure you get plenty of Vitamin C, zinc, and Vitamin D from the sun.

Doubts raised on effectiveness of coronavirus antibody testing in the UK,"(Natural News) Rapid antibody tests have been hailed as an effective way to check for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection for anyone who needs immediate results. Experts in the U.K., however, have warned that antibody tests are not reliable enough while questioning the use of wide-scale testing to influence public behavior.

According to a review of studies conducted by Cochrane, a U.K.-based network that assesses health research to help direct policy, roughly one in 10 antibody tests will miss cases of COVID-19. This could lead to people making harmful decisions delaying treatment or even traveling.

“There is no decision [patients] should be making based on the results of a test,” stated the review’s lead author Jon Deeks, a professor of biostatistics at Birmingham University in England. “We have to ask: Is this doing more harm than good?”

Review of studies raises doubts on antibody tests’ accuracy

Cochrane’s review took a look at 54 studies, the majority of which took place in China. In addition, it also looked at over 11,000 patient records and focused on 25 commercially available tests. Antibody test kits from Roche and Abbott Laboratories – those acquired by the British government – were not included in the review.

In reviewing the studies, the researchers outlined several concerns about their quality. This included the small size of some of the studies, as well as the inclusion of multiple samples from the same patients.

“Methodological limitations raise questions about how trustworthy these figures are,” said Deeks.

In one of the studies reviewed – a British one at that – the biomarker manufacturers did not approve the identification of the tests that had been evaluated. According to Deeks, this raised “moral issues.”

The review did find that that the tests, which rely on either a finger prick or blood being drawn from a vein, were much better at detecting the coronavirus in people at least two weeks after the onset of symptoms.

Tests conducted up to seven days after symptoms manifested picked up only 30 percent of coronavirus cases, the study found. From eight to 14 days after the onset, the tests found 70 percent; 15 to 35 days afterward, the tests detected more than 90 percent.

“The clearest result we have is that: Timing is critical,” said Deeks.

The researchers, however, said that they have no data on how well the tests work more than five weeks after symptoms manifest. In addition, they also state that the test’s accuracy may be much lower outside a healthcare setting – most of the studies evaluated the accuracy in hospitalized patients. As such, it is unclear whether they can detect antibody levels associated with milder and asymptomatic cases.

Based on their findings, the researchers said that the U.K. government’s antibody program should only be carried out for population-wide research purposes as scientists can adjust for accuracy limitations when looking at large datasets. The antibody tests should not, however, be used to inform individual decision-making.

Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University, who was not involved in the review, said that the review’s findings “make it very clear that most, if not all, commercially available tests are not sufficiently accurate to warrant their use outside of the healthcare setting.”

Immunity passports in doubt

The Cochrane review deals a serious blow to efforts to create “immunity passports” based on antibody testing, allowing people to go about their lives without fear of catching the COVID-19. (Related: The Bill Gates global nightmare is coming true with COVI-PASS Immunity Passports.)

Back in March, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed that the tests would be a “total game-changer” and that they would be “as simple as a pregnancy test” – neither of which has been the case.

While the test kits used by the British government – supplied by Roche and Abbott Laboratories – were not part of the review, issues have been raised about them as well.

In May, Deeks called into question the effectivity of these test kits. He pointed out how, in a review of Roche’s own evidence, their test kit failed to pick up 15 known coronavirus antibody-positive samples out of 93. The Abbott test, on the other hand, was more sensitive, picking up 90 out of 96 positive samples.

Despite all the concerns raised, however, U.K. officials remain adamant about antibody testing, with the Department of Health and Social Care stating that “antibody testing will improve our understanding of how coronavirus is spreading across the country, which will be vital for future decisions about controlling the virus.”

The coronavirus may actually be a vascular – and not a respiratory – disease,"(Natural News) The symptoms of COVID-19 may very well be eldritch horrors. In most cases, it can appear as cough, fever, chills and headache. But in severe cases, it can cause acute kidney failure and multiple organ damage – strange symptoms for what’s known as mainly a respiratory infection.

How COVID-19 causes the latter, in particular, was the focus of a recent paper by a team from University Hospital Zurich. In their report, senior author Frank Ruschitzka examined COVID-19 patients who exhibited severe symptoms. After the first body was autopsied, it showed tiny clots and dead cells within the capillaries of the lungs, as well as distended blood vessels in every organ in the body – a sign of severe inflammation.

This also showed why patients with severe COVID-19 are more likely to have strokes, blood clots and even heart attacks: The virus had targeted their blood vessels.

“[COVID-19] is a vascular problem,” added Ruschitzka, who published his team’s findings in the Lancet. “The lung is the main battlefield, but it’s a disease of the blood vessels.”

A blood vessel disease?

Months into the pandemic and with over 8 million cases and counting, medical experts are now looking into the possibility that COVID-19 is a vascular disease.

According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, patients who died from COVID-19 had nine times as many clots in their lungs as those who died of the H1N1 flu. Other studies have similar results, from inflammatory symptoms in children to strokes in adults with no history of the condition.

A study from Belgium looked at the findings of this study, as well as the Zurich study, and found that damage in the endothelial cells that line blood vessels in the lungs can predict if a COVID-19 patient will slip into the fatal “second phase” of the disease. In the report, senior author Peter Carmeliet explained that an infection can cause blood vessels to leak and clot in some patients. This, in turn, triggers inflammation in the body, as well as gives rise to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) – the complication responsible for most COVID-19 deaths.

“It’s a vicious cycle,” explained Nilam Mangalmurti, a lung expert at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

Blood vessels link chronic disease and COVID-19

The Belgian study, published in Nature Reviews Immunology, can shine a light on why COVID-19 is life-threatening for people with chronic illnesses like diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease, as the cells lining their blood vessels are already compromised.

Endothelial cells do more than line blood vessels and tissues. They also control the flow of substances and fluid into and out of a tissue, regulate blood pressure, prevent inflammation and inhibit clots. When these are injured, the cells signal immune cells and clotting factors to help repair the site of injury, as well as warn other cells of potential invaders.

Based on autopsy reports detailed in the Zurich study, researchers of the Belgian study believe that SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen behind COVID-19, can cause this response to go out of control. (Related: Coronavirus hijacks immune cells to create cytokine storms, says new study.)

Aside from exploring the possibility of COVID-19 being a vascular disease, researchers are also looking into the idea of using existing anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting treatments for the disease. In the U.S. and Europe, clinical trials that use drugs are already in progress. In China, the government has taken a more natural route, promoting the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine in treating COVID-19.

Scientists warn: Antibodies your body makes to fight the coronavirus don’t last long,"(Natural News) Antibodies that can supposedly grant immunity from COVID-19 have been the linchpin of many strategies to fight the ongoing pandemic. A new study, however, looks to put a damper on those plans.

Published on the journal Nature Medicine, this new study suggests that antibodies that the immune system produces against the coronavirus may last only two to three months.

Antibodies don’t last that long

Antibodies that can fight other coronaviruses, such as those that cause SARS and MERS, are thought to last for about a year. Based on this, scientists were hoping that antibodies against the Wuhan coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) would last at least as long.

Chinese researchers looked at 37 asymptomatic people and compared them to an equal number of people who had symptoms from the Wanzhou District in central China.

Several studies have shown that people who are most visibly ill with COVID-19 develop antibodies against the disease. This new study, however, is the first to look at the immune response of asymptomatic people.

The researchers found that the asymptomatic people did produce antibodies; however, their immune response was weaker than in those who developed symptoms.

More importantly, the antibody levels fell to undetectable levels in 40 percent of asymptomatic people, compared to just 13 percent of those who had symptoms.

Other experts question the study

While the study shows that antibody levels dropped quickly, especially in asymptomatic people, several experts cautioned that this doesn’t necessarily mean that people can get infected a second time.

These experts pointed out that the researchers did not into account the protection offered by immune cells that may fight the coronavirus on their own or produce new antibodies when they detect the virus.

Studies have already shown that the coronavirus triggers a cellular immune response, that is both robust and protective.

“Most people are generally not aware of T cell immunity, and so much of the conversation has focused on antibody levels,” said Columbia University virologist Angela Rasmussen.

Aside from virus-killing T cells, infected people also make so-called memory B cells, which can rapidly ramp up antibody production should they detect the coronavirus again.

Current immunity strategies may need rethinking

The results of the study cast doubt on the proposal for “immunity passports” that many experts, including those in the World Health Organization (WHO), have proposed.

With “immunity passports,” people who have been confirmed to have immunity against the coronavirus, either through antibody testing or because they’ve recovered from the disease, will be allowed to return to normal life.

The idea is that this would allow businesses to return to normal and economies to recover without having to risk a second wave of the disease — everyone who’s up and about should theoretically already be immune.

Another idea that the study shoots down is that of “herd immunity.” This concept relies on having a large enough portion of the general populace be immune to SARS-CoV-2, that it’s unable to spread to those who don’t have immunity.

Based on the study, however, these ideas won’t work since it implies that people don’t retain their immunity for very long.

Other studies do show that the immune systems of people who’ve recovered may be able to fight off the virus through other means; however, it would be reckless to just rely on these, especially as scientists still have much to learn about the disease.

Perhaps, a more responsible approach to the ongoing pandemic would be to focus on protecting people from catching the disease in the first place, providing people with protective equipment while testing and isolating those who’ve already caught it.

"People with mild symptoms can develop immunity against coronavirus, says research","(Natural News) French researchers have found that even mild cases of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) can produce antibodies in almost all patients. In addition, they reveal that the patient’s defenses against the virus increase as he starts recovery.

The report, which is posted on the medRxiv server, adds evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 could acquire some degree of immunity. But it’s still unclear how long recovered patients carry immunity or to what degree.

The issue of whether a person develops immunity against the coronavirus is something that continues to baffle scientists and policymakers alike. Currently, even scientists are divided on the idea that people with COVID-19 develop an immunity to it, and many public health policies are hinged on people developing immunity from the disease, or herd immunity.

Based on initial reports, patients who have mild COVID-19 symptoms either lack or have a limited presence of antibodies.

Most patients with mild symptoms develop antibodies

In the current study, researchers from the Pasteur Institute in Paris took samples from over 160 health workers from the CHU de Strasbourg Hospital in France. The health workers all tested positive for COVID-19 after a “super-spreader” event – a five-day prayer and fasting gathering at an evangelical church in eastern France. While the health workers who participated in the study had the coronavirus, they weren’t ill enough to be admitted to hospital.

The team noted that most COVID-19 studies on immunity looked at patients who were hospitalized following severe illness and then recovered. Their study, in contrast, focused on mild cases, which make up for around 80 percent of all infections.

The researchers used two assay tests to determine if the participants had developed antibodies – a commercially available test kit, and a test designed by the team to identify if antibodies were produced and if they have the ability to neutralize the virus. From the results of the second test, 99.4 percent of the participants produced antibodies – only one participant, a 58-year-old man, had no antibodies detected.

The team also noted that a person’s antibody response grew stronger as he recovered. The antibodies were also effective in fighting off the virus. (Related: Coronavirus hijacks immune cells to create cytokine storms, says new study.)

“The [neutralizing] activity is present much later than the appearance of antibodies and this is encouraging,” senior author Olivier Schwartz told Le Monde newspaper. He also added that his team is looking forward to studying the participants further to see how long the antibodies stay in their system.

The researchers also noted that the ability of antibodies to neutralize the virus becomes stronger over time. In particular, the neutralization activity of the antibodies was at 97 percent four weeks after the onset of symptoms. This could mean that most individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms develop antibodies within a month after exhibiting symptoms.

“Although not yet demonstrated, several lines of evidence suggest that the presence of [neutralizing] antibodies may be associated with protective immunity for Sars-CoV-2 infection,” the researchers concluded in their report. They added that patients who recovered from SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, had antibodies that persisted for at least two years after the infection.

Meanwhile, a separate study from the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported a case of a monoclonal antibody from a recovering COVID-19 patient. In the report, which was published in Nature, the team noted that the antibody exhibited a strong ability to kill the virus when it was used in treatment, as well as prevent the increase in viral load during preventive treatment.

"Pro-life group warns about COVID vaccines made from aborted babies, vaccine mandates","(Natural News) A pro-life group has called attention to some of the ethical issues surrounding vaccines and the coronavirus vaccine in particular, especially when it comes to the vaccines being made using the cells of aborted babies and the possibility of mandatory vaccination.

The Personhood Alliance issued 10 key points outlining the group’s official position on the ethics of vaccines. They are based on the principle of “the rights of born persons not to be forced to violate their own bodily integrity and/or moral conscience and the rights of pre-born persons not to be trafficked, commodified, and/or experimented upon without their consent.”

Many of the Big Pharma companies that make vaccines use cells from aborted babies to produce them. This is considered unethical by the alliance, who called on vaccine makers to do more to produce more ethical varieties, particularly in cases where taxpayer funding is being used.

They added that Christians should be demanding that pharmaceutical companies put a stop to the commodification and trafficking of humans at all stages of life and avoid practices that “perpetuate and encourage the relationship between abortion, biomedical science, and human trafficking, no matter when that connection was initiated or how long a practice has been socially accepted.”

Tyler, Texas Bishop Joseph Strickland has been vocal about this topic. In April, he tweeted that if the only way to get a vaccine for this virus is by using the body parts of aborted children, he will refuse it. He added: “I will not kill children to live.”

Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano and a group of other Cardinals issued a public letter in May reminding Catholics that it is morally unacceptable to use a vaccine that is derived from aborted fetuses. They added that people should be given the chance to refuse these vaccines without facing any penalties. It was signed by 22 priests as well as journalists, lawyers, doctors and academics. It has already collected more than 57,000 signatures.

Vaccine mandates “unethical and intrusive”

Their document also addresses the topic of mandatory vaccines, calling such policies “unethical and intrusive.” They said that people’s rights to refuse medical treatment on religious, health or moral grounds should be preserved and protected by law and that this should extend to decisions about vaccination. They added that forcing vaccines on people is a “violation of their biblical personhood.”

Bishop Athanasius Schneider of Astana, Kazakhstan, had harsh words for the practice, calling mandatory vaccines in an interview “the last step of Satanism.” Pope Francis, meanwhile, recently called for vaccinations to be “universal and for all.”

In May, President Trump confirmed that coronavirus vaccines will not be forced on people who do not want them at the federal level, acknowledging that not everyone will be willing to subject their bodies to these shots. However, individual governments could still require mandatory COVID vaccines at the state level.

Even without federal or state mandates, some employers could end up demanding that their workforce be vaccinated, even against their will. This could be much like what happens in the medical field now with doctors and nurses, who can lose their jobs for refusing to get a flu shot.

It isn’t a stretch to imagine certain types of workers being pushed out of their jobs for non-compliance, especially people working in hospitality or education, for example.

There are far too many ways that people could be coerced into getting the COVID shot, and the fact that many of the front-runner vaccines in development contain the cells of aborted babies adds an even more horrifying element to an already highly disturbing prospect.

Johnson & Johnson’s aborted baby Covid-19 vaccine harms trial participant,"(Natural News) Things are going exceptionally poorly for Big Pharma in its quest to release “warp speed” vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19). The latest casualty is Johnson & Johnson, which halted its trial due to an “unexplained illness” in one of its participants.

Similar to what happened with AztraZeneca’s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine trial, J&J observed a participant suffer from a serious adverse event, prompting the company to put an immediate stop to its Phase 3 operations.

This means that all trials involving J&J’s vaccine candidate, including a large-scale one launched on Sept. 22 by Janssen with an anticipated enrollment of 60,000 volunteers at 215 research sites, are now on hold while the pharma giant investigates what happened.

In cooperation with an “independent Data Safety Monitoring Board,” J&J is reportedly evaluating the participant, whose illness has not yet been publicly released. J&J’s “internal clinical and safety physicians” are also involved in the investigation.

According to the company, adverse events “are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies.” As a result, there are “prespecified guidelines” for how to proceed when a “serious adverse event” occurs.

More stories like this one can be found at Pandemic.news.

Injecting aborted babies into your body is never a good idea

Having received $1.5 billion from the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to produce a vaccine, J&J, along with AstraZeneca and several others that also received taxpayer funding, are rushing at “warp speed” to get a Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine to market as quickly as possible.

In J&J’s case, its vaccine contains a human fetal cell line known as PER.C6 that was taken from the retinal tissue of an 18-week-old baby boy who was aborted in The Netherlands back in 1985 and turned into a fetal cell line 10 years later.

AstraZeneca’s jab, which reportedly caused transverse myelitis in a participant, is similarly derived from an aborted baby cell line known as HEK 293. Like J&J, AstraZeneca halted its Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine trial when its aborted baby jab caused harm in a participant.

“I isolated retina from a fetus, from a healthy fetus as far as could be seen, of 18 weeks old,” stated Dr. Alex van der Eb, who developed the PER.C6 aborted baby cell line used in J&J’s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine.

“There was nothing special with a family history or the pregnancy was completely normal up to the 18 weeks, and it turned out to be a socially indicated abortus – abortus provocatus, and that was simply because the woman wanted to get rid of the fetus … what was written down was unknown father, and that was, in fact, the reason why the abortion was requested.”

It is no wonder that participants are suffering serious adverse events, as foreign DNA from aborted babies is not supposed to be injected into other human beings to “cure” them from alleged viruses, which is exactly what is now happening under Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” mass vaccination program.

Thanks to Trump’s large cash infusion into J&J, the company is expected to very soon deliver 100 million doses of its aborted baby vaccine, with the option already in place to deliver many more should the government request them.

“The volunteers for these vaccine trials are probably the insane screeching Karens that have an aneurysm whenever they spot someone without a mask at 100 yards,” wrote one LifeSiteNews commenter about the situation.

“There is a horrifying, fatal illness that attacks the brain – which only cannibals get,” noted another, the suggestion being that the aborted fetal cell component of these Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines is akin to cannibalism.

“This is the same thing on a lesser scale. No doubt God created certain inherent protections to natural law. Regardless what the scientists and know-it-alls may think or desire.”

"Universal vaccination passport has been in development since 2018, requires absolute compliance with endless list of vaccines","(Natural News) As the current pandemic rages on, people around the world are being ordered to do things for the “greater good.” Governments are requiring specific things from people in order to protect the “public health.”

Long before the current pandemic, the European Union had been in the planning stages of developing a “common vaccination card/passport.” This universal vaccination passport is also designed for the “greater good” and will be implemented as a requirement to protect the “public health.”

How might your liberty and livelihood be restricted if you do not succumb to all the vaccines required for the universal passport?

Populations around the world are currently being conditioned to socially distance themselves from one another, in the expectation that everyone they meet is a biological source of contamination — innately guilty of spreading disease. Showing no authorization of immunity, every person is to be considered a filthy vector of disease and is to be avoided at all costs. The vaccination passport will be presented as the solution to quell these disease fears. By showing electronic proof of vaccination, people will be able to “return to normal” – a term used by authorities to coerce people to believe that biologics (vaccines) are the passport to prove absolute immunization. The commercialization of social distancing will continue until all citizens can prove they have received the authorized injections.

The European Union has been working on global vaccine passport since 2018

The planning stages began in 2018 when the European Union released a survey comparing public confidence/skepticism toward vaccines. The survey, titled “2018 State of Vaccine Confidence” was presented to the European Commission. The report immediately criticized “vaccine hesitancy” and praised “vaccine confidence,” in an attempt to build public trust in the effectiveness and safety of vaccines. The report immediately blames “vaccine delays and refusals” as the sole reason why outbreaks occur, why people are dying. One of the ways these central vaccine planners can eliminate “vaccine delays and refusals” is to blame people for diseases they don’t have. The next step is to socially isolate anyone who refuses vaccines by restricting their liberties.

A “common vaccine passport” achieves these goals. This passport is blatant coercion, a violation of informed consent in medicine, an attack on personal choice, and ultimately sets the stage for segregation of healthy, unvaccinated people from society.

The central vaccine planners do not care how they ultimately coerce or manipulate people into submission. Soon after this coercive report was published, the EU commissioned a technical report titled “Designing and implementing an immunization information system” which mapped a monitoring system to ensure compliance to vaccinations. The report examined the development of a “common vaccination card/ passport for all including a comprehensive electronic immunization information system that can monitor vaccine compliance. Finally, the report sought to “overcome the legal and technical barriers impeding the interoperability of national immunization information systems.”

By the third quarter of 2019, the EU created the “Vaccination Roadmap” designed to combat “vaccine hesitancy.” During this time, social media platforms began to label any information about vaccine choice, natural immunity, vaccine risk, and vaccine injury as dangerous “misinformation.”

Global Vaccination Summit and the “call to action” to implement the vaccine passport

By September 2019, the EU and the World Health Organization held the “Global Vaccination Summit.” There, “influential” leaders announced “10 Actions towards Vaccination for All” – a coercive plan to manipulate people into vaccine compliance. To make matters worse, just a month later, Event 201 was held. Sponsored by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Event 201 simulated a pandemic exercise focusing on a zoonotic novel coronavirus originating in bats. By November of 2019, these central vaccine planners had suggested a “call to action.”

All this planning came before the current pandemic. The people who have planned for a vaccine passport are now calling for a “certificate of immunity.” Central vaccine planners like Bill Gates are now parading the media, and are putting their “call to action” into motion. People are now being told by their governments and their media that life cannot go back to normal unless there is a vaccine. The vaccine, currently being rushed into existence, will enable the coercive and forceful vaccination passport to become a reality.

The planning is documented. The coercion is out in the open. Will you be a slave to this system of medical rape, as individual consent, choice, and human dignity are stripped away?

"Eugenicist Bill Gates co-hosted a “high-level pandemic exercise” back in October, just in time for the patented coronavirus he helped fund to be unleashed","(Natural News) Not long before Chinese coronavirus started making global headlines, The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, held a high-level pandemic exercise called “Event 201” that seems to have been a predictive blueprint for what’s now transpiring with the coronavirus outbreak.

On October 18, 2019, representatives from each of the aforementioned groups descended on New York City to discuss how they would respond to “a severe pandemic” much like the one we’re now being told is spreading across China and into the West.

The exercise “illustrated areas where public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences,” an official announcement from Event 201 reads.

“In recent years, the world has seen a growing number of epidemic events, amounting to approximately 200 events annually,” the announcement goes on to explain. “These events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society.”

According to the event’s organizers, a pandemic like the one we could be seeing form right now before our very eyes requires “cooperation” among governments, industries, and “key international institutions” – the latter presumably referring to organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Is coronavirus yet another ploy to thin the “herd” and sell more vaccines?

The timing of Event 201 is nothing short of suspicious in light of the fact that coronavirus is all the media is talking about right now. It’s even eclipsing President Trump’s impeachment proceedings in the Senate, with news about entire cities in China that are home to tens of millions of people being put under mandatory quarantine.

We’re also seeing headlines about coronavirus popping up in major U.S. cities like Seattle, Houston and Chicago, which is starting to generate panic here in our own country about how far this thing will go before either fizzling out – a best-case scenario – or spreading like wildfire.

As Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, is now warning, the rapid adaptation or mutation of coronavirus suggests that this might be another weaponized viral strain that was intentionally unleashed for eugenics purposes.

Mainstream reporting is admitting that coronavirus is constantly changing like some kind of self-replicating bioweapon, which is all too convenient considering that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Pirbright Institute owns a patent on coronavirus for vaccine creation purposes.

Was this whole outbreak engineered for the purpose of scaring the general public into accepting yet another government vaccine? Is it also about depopulating the planet as part of Bill Gates’ admitted efforts to use vaccination and “health care” as a means of reducing the world’s population by 10 to 15 percent?

Time will tell what becomes of this latest public health scare, but one thing is for sure: Bill Gates and his eugenicist buddies are chomping at the bit to vaccinate the entire planet against coronavirus and any other disease they can conjure up as a deadly bioweapon.

At the current time, the fatality rate associated with coronavirus infection is relatively low, around two percent. But that could very quickly change as the virus mutates and adapts to new environments, creating the horrific scenario predicted by Event 201.

“Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global – a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences,” the Event 201 description ominously forebodes.

“A severe pandemic, which becomes ‘Event 201,’ would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions.”

Doctor who cured 350 coronavirus patients with 100% success rate speaks out passionately in Washington D.C.,"(Natural News) Dr. Stella Immanuel of the Rehoboth Medical Center in Houston, Texas went viral in a matter of hours after appearing live at the “White Coat Summit” in Washington, D.C. in front of the Supreme Court of the United States. Dr. Immanuel gave a hopeful, passionate speech about curing coronavirus patients with 100 percent effectiveness.

The event was led by an organization called America’s Frontline Doctors, a group founded by Dr. Simone Gold, a board-certified physician and attorney. The group of medical doctors came together and presented a message of hope and addressed a “massive disinformation campaign” about the coronavirus — disinformation that is suppressing immune system modulating cures, treatment, and prevention.

Courageous doctor goes public with covid-19 cure

Dr. Immanuel cured three hundred fifty coronavirus patients with a 100 percent success rate using a combination of hydroxychloroquine (sixty-year-old anti-viral compound with a track record of safety and effectiveness) zinc (an immune system modulating mineral) and azithromycin (broad-spectrum antibiotic).

The original video has already been removed by almost every Big Tech social media platform (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), as the Big Pharma gatekeepers of information try to keep the people in the dark, controlled, afraid, and subservient to an official, helpless narrative. Access the video here at Brighteon.com.

Dr. Immanuel wrote that the fear, sickness, and deaths were “senseless and unnecessary.”

“Covid19 has a cure,” she spoke. “It’s time for politicians to let doctors be doctors and for doctors to stop being afraid. They can silence a few but not a multitude. Join us in the fight doctors! America needs you!”

Dr. Immanuel said that any study that claims hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is not effective for treating patients with coronavirus is “fake science.” She knows this for a fact because she used the antiviral medication to help all her patients recover from coronavirus infections.

In fact, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who downplayed the drug’s effectiveness, actually knew about its effectiveness for treating coronavirus for fifteen years, when the NIH published studies on chloroquine’s effectiveness for treating SARS.

Dr. Anthony Fauci trying to suppress effective treatments to force experimental vaccines on people

In what appears to be a matter of corruption, Dr. Fauci is currently trying to convince the world population to stay confined in their homes and to comply to contact tracing, restricted gathering, and indefinite mask wearing until a DNA-altering vaccine is available for population control. Fauci’s guidance has left countless men and women to die from a respiratory infection that could be cured using a simple antiviral, immune system modulating protocol.

The research that Fauci knew about while working at the NIH finds that “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” HCQ is a less toxic derivative of this chloroquine and can help deliver zinc into human cells, halting viral replication and speeding up recovery time for patients. Since the new covid-19 virus is genetically related to SARS, the NIH and Dr. Fauci should have rushed to try the drug and promote its use. Instead, Dr. Fauci began raising money for new vaccines and suppressed the effectiveness of this cheap antiviral molecule.

Instead of reigning from a fearful pulpit and doing photo-ops, Dr. Fauci should be meeting with front line doctors and nurses who care for coronavirus patients first hand. HCQ is an effective prophylactic and therapeutic, stopping the replication of viruses in human cells before and after infection with a live virus.

Dr. Immanuel is a light in a dark world and a true leader in medicine at a time when people are being conditioned to fear their own hands and breath while submitting to arbitrary controls.

"Trump pushes for an accelerated, risky vaccine “by the end of the year,” then says coronavirus will “go away without a vaccine”","(Natural News) A few days ago, President Trump publicly announced that a new vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) would probably be ready “by the end of the year” as part of “Operation Warp Speed.” But the president has since changed his tune and is now saying that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will “go away without vaccine.”

Even though it typically takes anywhere from three to five years to develop a new vaccine, the Trump administration had appeared fully supportive of developing one in a fraction of that amount of time to address the current global pandemic. Trump himself even indicated that he is “pushing very hard” to make a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine come to fruition as quickly as possible, even though this accelerated timeline puts many people’s lives at risk.

“We are pushing supply lines,” Trump is quoted as saying to the media. “We don’t even have the final vaccine,” he further stated, adding that he believes “many companies are, I think, close,” citing pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson by name.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has largely agreed with Trump’s statements, indicating that it is possible “to shave a couple of months off that,” referring to a proposed 18-month accelerated timeline for the release of a new vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“But, you know, you don’t want to over-promise,” Fauci added during an interview with CBS News. “We’ll just have to see how it goes.”

Not long after this all occurred, however, President Trump switched gears and began to tell the media the exact opposite of what he had stated prior. Without going into specifics, Trump pointed to other viruses and flus that have “disappeared” before vaccines were ever developed for them, and suggested that the same will happen with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“It’s going to go away,” Trump stated emphatically. “And we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time … They’ve never shown up again,” he added, referring to other viruses and flus in the past. “They die, too. Like everything else, they die.”

What is Trump’s real position on vaccines and coronavirus?

Doublespeak on the part of Trump is nothing new, and he has received plenty of criticism over the years for his duplicitous statements, sometimes made just hours apart from one another. On the other hand, some believe that Trump is playing some kind of long game where he intentionally says contradictory things to weed out who’s who in his administration.

Long before he was president, Trump publicly stated that he “strongly” believes vaccines to be linked to autism, which suggests that he does not support the government’s vaccine agenda. With that said, Trump’s now-stated plan for an accelerated Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine by year’s end could simply be a decoy to bait his enemies into exposing their true intentions.

On the other hand, it could be that Trump simply does not know how to tell the truth and is in a constant state of flux when it comes to his position on any given matter. Is Trump really against vaccines, or was he rallying public support for himself among vaccine skeptics years before he decided to run for president?

As of this writing, Trump’s most recent stated position is that a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will not be needed because the virus is going to disappear for good some other way. And this is the position we hope he sticks with moving forward.

"Medical trials for COVID-19 vaccine candidates may be unable to stop people from falling ill and dying, scientist warns","(Natural News) A scientist has warned that phase three trials currently underway for COVID-19 vaccine candidates may ultimately be unable to stop the coronavirus. University of Maryland professor Peter Doshi wrote in an Oct. 21 piece in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) that coronavirus vaccines currently being developed may not be able to protect people from serious illness or death once they contract the pathogen.

His statements followed trials conducted by seven pharmaceutical companies – Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm and Sinovac – for their respective coronavirus vaccine candidates. Doshi, who is also the BMJ’s associate editor, pointed out two issues in the ongoing vaccine trials.

First, scientists did not anticipate whether volunteers would be shielded from severe disease or death if they contract the pathogen before the vaccine is rolled out – which would only be the case if the vaccine did not work very well. This is a particular concern for senior citizens, who are the most at risk from the effects of a severe COVID-19 infection, as the vaccine may not be as effective at protecting them from the coronavirus in the first place.

Vaccines typically do not work as well for people aged 60 and up because of their aged immune system. Pregnant women, children, and immunocompromised people have also been excluded from vaccine trials, so there is little data on the vaccine’s effects on these populations.

Second, the studies will not prove person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 can be halted – as scientists themselves are not measuring if volunteers who contract the coronavirus pass it to their friends and family whether or not they themselves get sick.

“The current phase three trials are not actually set up to prove either,” Doshi commented.

Pharmaceutical companies have defended the value of these vaccine trials

Many countries in the world are hoping to discover a vaccine that works to put an end to the current coronavirus pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 1 million worldwide. Thus, a number of scientists have responded to Doshi’s take on vaccine trials.

Moderna Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tal Zaks told BMJ that if its vaccine is proven to protect against mild COVID-19, the company is confident that the vaccine will be of the same effect with more severe infections. The vaccine will have to be ineffective in the first place if a person develops the disease. Zaks added that “too many people would die” if studies looked at the ability of Moderna’s vaccine to prevent coronavirus deaths. (Related: Fascism on display: The NIH owns HALF of Moderna’s new coronavirus vaccine.)

Dr. Andrew Preston of the University of Bath agreed with Zaks, telling the Daily Mail that “covering every manifestation of COVID-19 would require trials so large … that they are very likely to be impossible to run and fund. Preston added that vaccine trials encompassing all COVID-19 symptoms “would delay the data so long that we’d be living without any vaccine … for years to come.”

Preston remarked that testing vaccines on vulnerable populations such as the elderly would have “highly questionable ethics,” so it made more sense to test whether the vaccine worked in people who would experience less severe complications. However, he agreed that vaccine trials should be clear regarding what they will and will not report.

“I suspect many … [want] to ‘return life to normal’ and so there needs to be careful consideration of what the various effects of the vaccines might be. So it’s important that as we head towards the point when mass vaccination will begin, everyone is clear about what this will change in terms of restrictions, public health and disease,” he said.

Coronavirus vaccine trials barely tackle the issue of safety

Phase three trials for coronavirus vaccine candidates look at the efficacy of the jabs, but not their safety. Two pharmaceutical firms already reported volunteers experiencing adverse reactions after being administered with coronavirus vaccines.

Johnson & Johnson suspended U.S. trials for its one-shot coronavirus jab after a volunteer experienced an “unexplained illness.” It identified “no clear cause” for the illness and attributed the volunteer’s adverse reaction to “many possible factors.” The drug maker’s suspension of its vaccine trials was “in compliance with regulatory standards,” it stated.

AstraZeneca already reported three instances of adverse reactions in coronavirus vaccine trial participants. Two volunteers reported spinal inflammation after receiving the jab in September, while a third participant died in October. However, the British pharmaceutical company will not put vaccine trials on hold.

Doshi pointed out two issues in the vaccine trials, but the real question should be: Are these new COVID-19 vaccines even safe?

Who needs SCIENCE? China justifies widespread COVID-19 immunizations without bothering with clinical trials,"(Natural News) The Chinese government defended widespread immunizations against COVID-19 outside of clinical trials in the country. The vaccinations were warranted, as there were no documented side effects from the experimental vaccines, and imported COVID-19 cases proved to be a serious risk to the country. Chinese National Health Commission director for coronavirus vaccine development Zheng Zhongwei said Oct. 20 that China still sees “enormous pressure” from imported cases despite efforts to address outbreaks domestically.

Chinese health authorities authorized in July the emergency use of three potential vaccine candidates made by domestic pharmaceutical companies China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), under its subsidiary China National Biotech Group, and Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Frontline workers such as medical staff treating coronavirus patients and border officials received the experimental jab, but the order has since been expanded to include those working in state-owned companies. The government is also considering a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for exchange students going overseas to study.

Meanwhile, Sinovac has permitted members of the public in at least two Chinese cities to register and receive its its CoronaVac experimental shot. Zheng said that people who join Sinovac’s emergency-use program will be tracked for any adverse reactions. He added that immunized individuals reported no serious reactions beyond low-grade fevers and rashes.

However, experts have criticized the large-scale vaccinations with the experimental jabs – with some calling it “dangerous” and “a misuse of the program.”

New coronavirus infections in China have lingered to below 100 a day since mid-August, but the virus still resurges in small areas – with the most recent one in the eastern city of Qingdao. Chinese health officials have managed to suppress these outbreaks – including one in Beijing – through mass testing and implementation of public health protocols. Mask-wearing rules and temperature checks are still in place, and travelers from other countries need to isolate themselves for 14 days.

Based on data collated by Johns Hopkins University, China has a COVID-19 caseload of 91,044, with 4,729 fatalities and 85,899 recoveries.

Just like the U.S., China fast-tracked the development of its coronavirus vaccine

Countries looking to move beyond the pandemic and open their economies definitely need a vaccine against the coronavirus – and fast.

The vaccine development process, which usually takes years, has been compressed into months thanks to politicians looking for a cure to the pandemic that has made 40 million people worldwide sick. Under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Operation Warp Speed is one such program to fast-track the development of a COVID-19 vaccine – albeit only limited to Americans. (Related: Trump administration demanding nationwide rollout of COVID-19 vaccines by Nov. 1.)

In a similar vein, Chinese drugmakers are leading the race to create an effective shot against the coronavirus. China’s emergency-use authorization parameters were approved following rigorous deliberation among vaccine and ethics experts. The World Health Organization backed these same parameters, which served as the basis for giving Sinovac and Sinopharm’s vaccine candidates the emergency green light.

However, safety concerns have emerged alongside the rush to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine. Western pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca have temporarily halted their vaccine trials after volunteers experienced adverse side effects. To make matters worse, The Epoch Times reported on Oct. 15, the death of a Brazilian participant in AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine trials.

Sinopharm and Sinovac representatives nevertheless assured there had been no reports of adverse reactions in phase three trial participants. Both companies have enrolled more than 50,000 people worldwide in their vaccine trials. With this outlook, Sinopharm Chairman Liu Jingzhen said his company would produce 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses next year.

The two companies will have to increase their production capacity to churn out more of their vaccine doses, as some countries had already placed orders. In late September, Sinovac inked a deal with the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo for 60 million coronavirus vaccine doses costing US$90 million. Reuters reported Oct. 3 that Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria asked Brazilian health regulator Anvisa to vaccinate the state’s population with CoronaVac.

The world must be aware of potential safety concerns alongside China’s efforts to fast-track a vaccine against the coronavirus.

"Same doctors pushing masks, lockdowns to “save lives” ignore forced organ harvesting in communist China","(Natural News) There is a pandemic of illicit organ harvesting taking place on a global scale, and the medical profession, too preoccupied with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) plandemic, is either turning a blind eye to it or complicit.

Those in need of vital organs who are unable to procure them through legal means are increasingly traveling to communist China, where prisoners of conscience such as members of Falun Gong are being systematically murdered by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) so their organs can be harvested and sold on the black market.

This is precisely what a woman who was in need of a liver took advantage of after Dr. Alexander Toledo diagnosed her with cancer. Failing to meet transplant criteria and unwilling to accept a non-curative treatment that at best would add nine months to her life, the woman traveled to China before returning to the United States with a fresh liver.

“She had received a liver transplant essentially on demand, which, of course … raised questions as to the source of the organs,” Toledo recalled about the 2008 case during an Oct. 26 online panel hosted by the University of North Carolina.

While under normal circumstances a transplant patient would receive a vital organ from a deceased donor, or perhaps a living donor with an extra to spare, transplant “tourism” is changing the way that people in need of surgery are living their best lives now.

In the case of the woman seen by Toledo, she returned to America with a new liver and “no meaningful donor information … beyond that the donor was young and healthy.” After doing a little digging, Toledo found out that the liver had been harvested from a prison of conscience in communist China and sold on the illicit transplant market.

China’s organ harvesting trader has been verified “beyond any reasonable doubt”

Since China did not have an official organ donation program at the time, it became clear very quickly that the transplant had come from an executed prisoner. Further investigation pinpointed the victim as a likely adherent to the spiritual practice of Falun Gong, which is prohibited in China.

Back in 1999, the CCP launched a massive persecution campaign against Falun Gong, for which there were about 100 million adherents during the 1990s. In the decades since, China has imprisoned and executed millions of them, as well as harvested their organs.

Despite a complete media blackout here in the states – this is due to nearly every major media corporation being in bed with the CCP – independent investigations have determined that the CCP is, in fact, harvesting the organs of primarily Falun Gong practitioners and selling them on the black market.

And this is happening “on a significant scale,” an independent tribunal discovered back in 2019. For at least the past decade, China’s illicit organ harvesting market has been going strong with little resistance, and almost nobody in the medical profession seems to care.

According to David Matas, a Canadian international human rights lawyer who has been studying the issue for at least the past 10 years, most in the medical community are turning a blind eye to China’s horrific human rights abuses, even as they continue to lecture us all about how we need to sacrifice our freedoms and liberties in order to “save lives” from being overtaken by COVID-19.

Only “a tiny minority of the transplantation professionals globally are willing to do anything about transplant abuse in China,” he warns. And many of them, he adds, are buying into the “Chinese propaganda hook, line, and sinker.”

“They echoed the Party line that the research is unverifiable, though it is both verifiable and verified beyond any reasonable doubt,” he contends.

Remdesivir study accidentally proves hydroxychloroquine effective against coronavirus,"(Natural News) To date, there has only been one study conducted on remdesivir, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) drug that Anthony Fauci wants you to take instead of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). And it just so happens that this one-and-only study does not actually prove the effectiveness of remdesivir.

As it turns out, the study proves quite the opposite: that remdesivir is essentially useless, and HCQ is a winner, when it comes to remediating the symptoms associated with a severe COVID-19 infection.

Despite the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) having granted emergency approval for remdesivir as an exclusive drug treatment for COVID-19 five months ago, the latest science does not support its use as an effective therapeutic.

The aforementioned single paper on remdesivir that the FDA used as “proof” of the drug’s safety and effectiveness actually found that HCQ, presumably in conjunction with the antibiotic drug azithromycin, provided the only tangible benefits observed throughout the research.

This final paper, which was published just a few weeks ago on Oct. 8, determined that at least 35 percent of study participants had received HCQ. And nearly all of the patients who benefitted were those who took HCQ, as opposed to remdesivir.

“Nothing in the study supports the hypothesis that [r]emdesivir is an effective antiviral for SARS-CoV-2,” notes Leo Goldstein. “The data in the final report suggests that [h]ydroxychloroquine, not [r]emdesivir, was the main factor benefitting the patients in this study.”

Remdesivir harms and kills coronavirus patients; it does not heal

What is worse, the study further found that the patients who received remdesivir as opposed to HCQ actually suffered worse outcomes. You read that correctly: the drug claimed by Fauci to be a “cure” for COVID-19 is actually killing COVID-19 patients.

“The study’s own numbers show an association between RDV (remdesivir) and increased mortality in the most severe patients,” Goldstein further explains. “It is also possible to conclude that RDV is net harmful for most hospitalized patients.”

Another thing to note about this study is that it in no way meets any of the FDA’s usual “gold standards” for reliable research. For one, it was not double-blinded, though it was falsely reported as such.

The pre-registered protocol was also changed multiple times over the course of the trial, as was the primary outcome of the research. The outcome, it turns out, was altered after it was determined that remdesivir was not providing the types of results that researchers had hoped to procure.

“The outcome measures were subjective and not reliable,” Goldstein further reveals, adding that the study “was marred with conflicts of interest, aggravated by the design giving NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) and Gilead (remdesivir’s manufacturer) leverage over the hospitals and physicians treating patients.”

None of this is all that surprising when considering the dark history of Gilead, which by all appearances is a terrorist organization that conspires with the deep state to commit heinous crimes against humanity.

This would explain why at least three of the study’s researchers received grants and/or personal fees directly from Gilead, and conveniently failed to report these as potential conflicts of interest.

Chances are that none of this will ever hit mainstream media headlines, which means readers like yourself will have to share it with your friends and family directly. We must spread the truth far and wide because the sooner we do, the sooner this whole plandemic house of cards comes crashing down where it belongs.

By the way, if you are interested in taking a closer look at the study and Goldstein’s analysis of it, you can do so at this link.

Gates vaccine spreads polio across Africa,"(Natural News) Microsoft founder Bill Gates has made himself the global vaccine czar as his foundation spends billions on spreading new vaccines globally. While much attention has been given to the role of Gates behind the corrupt WHO in promoting radical untested coronavirus vaccines, the record of the Gates Foundation pushing an oral polio vaccine across Africa gives more sobering evidence that all Gates says and does is not genuine human charity. The UN has just recently admitted that new cases of infantile paralysis or polio have resulted in Africa from an oral polio vaccine developed with strong support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It mirrors what happened in the USA in the 1950s. This is worth a closer look.

(Article by F. William Engdahl republished from Journal-Neo.org)

Vaccines that cause polio

The vaccine industry loves to cite development of vaccines in the 1950s as solely responsible for eradicating what was a severe paralytic illness that reached a peak in the USA after World War II and as well, in England, Germany and other European countries. Now, despite the fact that no new cases of “wild polio” virus have been detected in all Africa since 2016, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and their allies in the WHO proclaimed that Gates’ $4 billion ten-year African vaccination campaign using an oral polio vaccine had finally eliminated the dreaded polio. That was at the end of August.

One week later on September 2, WHO was forced to backtrack and admit that new polio outbreaks in Sudan were linked to an ongoing series of new polio cases in Chad and Cameroon. According to the WHO, further polio cases have been registered in more than a dozen African countries including Angola, Congo, Nigeria and Zambia. But the shocking thing is that the outbreaks are all reportedly caused by the Gates-backed oral polio vaccine.

In a revealing comment, a CDC virologist involved with WHO and Gates Foundation in the Africa mass polio vaccination campaign, part of something called the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, admits the vaccine is creating significantly more cases of polio paralysis than the deceptively named “wild polio” disease. “We have now created more new emergences of the virus than we have stopped,” virologist Mark Pallansch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention admitted. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is a combined effort of the WHO, UNICEF, the U.S. CDC, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Rotary International.

Bill Gates was reportedly responsible for driving the campaign to develop the liquid oral polio vaccine and massively administer it to the populations of Africa and Asia despite the near absence of any cases of “wild polio.” According to one of the partners in the Gates polio initiative, from Rotary International, “Gates personally drove the development of a new polio vaccine that is now in the final stages of testing. When the idea was put forward, about the time of the last case of polio to happen in India, many were thinking the vaccine would play no important role in eradication, but Gates insisted.” When someone asked him, why polio, which had all but vanished worldwide, Gates replied, “Polio is a terrible disease.”

That reply seems curious, as there are far more pervasive deadly diseases out there including malaria or chronic diarrhoea due to unsafe water, and poor sanitation across Africa that causes death by dehydration, poor absorption of nutrients or infectious complications. I would argue that both those are also “terrible.” In 2016 chronic diarrhoea was listed by the WHO as the second leading cause of death in children below five worldwide. In Africa it was cause of almost 653,000 deaths, yet Mr. Gates and friends seem to be interested in other things.

The insistence of Gates on pushing massive vaccination of a new oral polio vaccine his foundation backed at a time polio even in poor countries of Asia and Africa is virtually non-existent, should ring alarm bells loudly. If his goal is to help more African children lead healthy lives, simple water treatment projects would save far more lives. Or is there something in the polio vaccine we are not being told of? Is there aluminum as adjuvant that is documented to be a central nervous system paralytic? Or other toxins?

The Gates Foundation spent almost $ 4 billion to develop and administer the oral polio vaccine throughout the poorest countries in the world as of 2018. This despite that WHO stated that the cases of polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan went from about 350,000 per year to 33 in 2018. There hasn’t been a case in the Americas or Western Europe since before the Gates polio project was launched years ago.

Define it away?

Here it gets into some very suspicious linguistic games on the part of WHO, Gates and company. They are trying to cover their deeds by claiming that most of the polio cases are actually something they decided to call acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). That is a debilitating condition with a clinical picture virtually identical to polio. But it keeps the “polio” numbers down. According to the US CDC, there were over 31,500 documented cases of acute flaccid paralysis from just 18 countries in 2017. This is in addition to what they call vaccine-associated polio paralysis (VAPP). Yet from the point of clinical symptoms, vaccine-derived polio, wild polio and acute flaccid paralysis are identical, as is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a subtype of AFP. With this proliferation of serious medical-sounding names to describe what produces the same medical symptoms, we have huge ground for manipulation.

A paper written by Neetu Vashishi and Jacob Puliyel published in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics in 2012 wrote about the Gates-CDC-WHO mass oral polio vaccine effort there: “… while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated…”

The 1950s

Defining away cases of poliomyelitis or Infantile Paralysis as it was called during the epidemic in the USA after World War II, went back to the 1950s, and to since-suppressed deadly scandals involving the first purported polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk. Regarded today as a medical hero, the truth of Salk was anything but heroic.

The upsurge in cases of what were then labelled poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis in the United States began to literally explode around 1946. Relevant to note is that a highly dangerous cumulative toxin, a now-banned insecticide known as DDT, was being promoted by the US government as a “safe” control of mosquitoes and flies said to be the “carriers” of polio virus. What has since been all but erased from the government record is the precise match of the number of cases of children with symptoms of acute polio with the degree of acute DDT spraying, and the equally precise mirrored decline of human polio cases from the late 1940s into the 1950s, after a sharp decline in DDT use. In 1953, Connecticut physician, Morton S. Biskind argued in public that, “the most obvious explanation for the polio epidemic: central nervous system diseases… such as polio are actually the physiological and symptomatic manifestations of the ongoing government- and industry-sponsored inundation of the world’s populace with central nervous system poisons.”

The Salk polio vaccine was first deployed in 1955, that is two years after the dramatic decline in registered polio cases. That fact was conveniently forgotten as the narrative was promoted that the new vaccine alone was eradicating the feared polio.

Serious evidence was presented by doctors and others to the US Congress that there was a clear connection between the summer polio epidemics to summer-used heavy metal pesticides such as DDT. They were ignored. The promotion of DDT as a harmless insecticide was so pervasive that kids followed behind trucks spraying the streets and swimming pools were sprayed with DDT, believing it harmless. Highly emotional advertising campaigns proclaimed that deadly polio was mysteriously transmitted by insects and that DDT would protect. Farmers were told to repeatedly spray their dairy cows with DDT to ward of the dangerous insects. DDT thus contaminated the milk supply. Use of DDT exploded by the end of the 1940s across the USA. As one person described it, “Concerned parents went further to protect their children. They feared the invisible virus as if it were hunting their children. They turned their homes into sterile zones by constantly spraying insecticides and washing down the walls with disinfectants.” That sounds familiar.

Salk and Rockefeller

The vaccine research of Jonas Salk as well as of his rival, Albert Sabin, was funded by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, later known as the March of Dimes. Salk convinced the US health authorities in 1954 that his polio vaccine contained only inactive virus (IPV), and was absolutely safe. He was able to convince the regulatory authorities that the “expensive and difficult procedures which had been suggested for the detection of possible residual live virus” in his vaccine should be dispensed with. Field trials of the Salk vaccine in 1954 were exposed by the Journal of the American Statistical Association: “…59 per cent of the trial was worthless because of the lack of adequate controls…” That report was ignored by the US Department of Health and the National Foundation proclaimed the Salk vaccine ready to mass distribute in spring of 1955.

Already in 1955 alarming results from the Salk vaccine had emerged. His vaccine, manufactured by Cutter Laboratories, was administered to over four hundred thousand people, mostly school children. Within days, reports of paralysis began surfacing. Within a month, the mass vaccination program against polio had to be suspended. In June of 1956, polio cases began to increase sharply in Chicago in children who had received the Salk vaccine. The National Foundation sent an urgent letter to its members urging them to, “give reassurance that the present Salk vaccine is safe and effective to patients, parents and others in your community who still needlessly doubt it…”

Salk’s vaccine had caused seventy thousand cases of muscle weakness, one hundred and sixty-four cases of severe paralysis and ten deaths. Three fourths of the victims remained permanently paralyzed. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare stepped down and the director of the NIH, resigned. The Cutter incident was quickly downplayed by the Government and vaccinations resumed after 21 days pause, using vaccines from Wyeth Labs. Those too produced cases of paralysis.

Between 1923 and 1953, before the Salk vaccine’s introduction, the polio death rate in the US had declined on its own by 47 percent; England had observed a similar pattern. Following the use of Salk’s vaccine between 1955 and 1963, cases of polio in the US increased—by 50 percent from 1957 to 1958, and by 80 percent between 1958 and 1959. This was concealed by a US Government change in defining polio, much as the WHO and CDC do today in Africa. Diseases that had previously been grouped together under the umbrella of “polio” began to be reported as separate diseases. One of these was aseptic or viral meningitis, an infectious disease that is difficult to distinguish from poliovirus, or transverse myelitis—a rare spinal cord inflammation, or the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Were all these a result of widespread toxins used in the vaccine? The Government and vaccine industry was not interested in knowing or telling.

Finally in 1963 the US Government replaced Salk’s IPV vaccine with an attenuated oral polio vaccine (OPV) developed by Albert Sabin. As a live virus vaccine, it, too, was and is capable of giving its recipients polio or polio symptoms. Salk testified before a Senate subcommittee in 1977 that the Sabin oral polio vaccine had caused most of the polio cases in the US since the early 1960s.

Rockefeller eugenics?

The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which funded both Salk and his rival Sabin in development of polio vaccines in the 1950’s, was run by two doctors from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research– Dr. Henry Kumm who had spent 23 years with the Rockefeller Institute, and Dr. Thomas Rivers.

Henry Kumm went over to the National Foundation in 1951 at the peak of the polio epidemic. In May 1953, Kumm became Director of Polio Research at NFIP. Notably, during World War II Kumm had served as civilian consultant to the Surgeon General of the US Army in Italy, directing field studies for the use of DDT against malarial mosquitoes.

Thomas Rivers was from 1922 head of the infectious disease ward at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, becoming the institute’s director in 1937. As chairman of committees on research and vaccine advisory for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, he oversaw the clinical trials of Jonas Salk’s vaccine by Dr Kumm’s group. It could be said that the National Foundation was a mask for a massive Rockefeller polio vaccine project.

Polio researcher David Oshisky stated, “In truth, polio was never the raging epidemic portrayed in the media, not even at its height in the 1940s and 1950s. Ten times as many children would die in accidents in those years, and three times as many would die of cancer. Polio’s special status was due, in large part, to the efforts of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, better known as the March of Dimes, which employed the latest techniques in advertising, fund raising and motivational research to turn a horrific but relatively uncommon disease in to the most feared affliction of its time. The genius of the National Polio Foundation lay in its ability to single out polio for special attention, making it seem more ominous than other diseases.” That National Foundation was run by Rockefeller doctors. This is very much what the Gates Foundation is doing with its turbo-charged oral polio vaccine in Africa where polio had almost vanished before the mass vaccine campaign of WHO and Gates.

Here the bond of dedication to eugenics and to dangerous vaccines seems to unite both the Rockefellers and Bill Gates, who in many ways is merely the heir and continuation of the deadly eugenics work of the Rockefellers. All this should give pause before regarding the pronouncements of Bill Gates on coronavirus and his favored vaccines as the scientific good truth.

"Faulty coronavirus tests: Goat, quail and papaya in Tanzania test positive for COVID-19, raising concerns about false positives","(Natural News) Coronavirus test kits in Tanzania have raised suspicions about their accuracy. President John Magufuli expressed during an event that he found them so unreliable due to the fact that certain animals and even a fruit have tested positive for COVID-19.

He further stated that the test kits were imported from overseas, but refused to specify where.

In order to evaluate the quality of the COVID-19 test kits, security forces in Tanzania obtained non-human samples from a goat, a papaya, a quail and even a sheep. The samples were assigned human names and then shipped off to a laboratory to be tested. Lab technicians who worked on the non-human samples weren’t informed about their true origins.

The test results showed that the goat, quail and papaya were found positive for COVID-19, which may have serious implications. According to Magufuli, this means some people could have received positive coronavirus test results despite not actually being infected.

This puts into question the country’s actual number of coronavirus cases. As of press time, the country has 509 reported cases of COVID-19, including 21 deaths. However, the actual number of cases could be higher because Tanzania goes days without providing updates.

A “dirty game” is going on in Tanzania’s coronavirus testing lab

Magufuli, who initially downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, suspended the head of testing at Tanzania’s national health laboratory on May 4, one day after he revealed that the lab had tested the non-human samples, noting that there was a “dirty game” going on at the laboratory.

Hassan Abbas, chief government spokesman of Tanzania, said that the country has formed a team to conduct further investigations on the laboratory that did the tests. They will release the results of their investigations as soon as they are complete. (Related: African coronavirus cases SPIKE by 43 percent – WHO warns that continent could be the “next epicenter” of the pandemic.)

“The equipment or people may be compromised and sometimes it can be sabotage,” said Magufuli in a speech broadcast through the country’s state-run news outlet.

Magufuli further cast doubt on the foreign aid Tanzania was receiving, saying that it may not always be “good for this nation” and that they shouldn’t accept all of it.

Coronavirus test kits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma

Africa’s testing capacity has expanded sharply since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the help of test kits procured from the WHO, the Jack Ma Foundation and other philanthropic organizations.

Jack Ma, Chinese billionaire and founder of the Alibaba Group, has donated thousands of test kits and protective gear to African nations. John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said that the Jack Ma Foundation had provided them with a lot of coronavirus test kits.

“We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries and providing them with test kits,” said Nkengasong. “We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.”

Nkengasong told journalists that the Africa CDC affirmed that the Tanzanian coronavirus test kits are “working very well.” The World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed their confidence in the reliability of the test kits.

When questioned regarding the veracity of the coronavirus tests, Matshidiso Moeti, head of WHO Africa, said that the tests procured through their organization and through the donations made by the Jack Ma Foundation were not contaminated with coronavirus.

Magufuli turns to alternative sources of aid for coronavirus

Losing any trust he had in the WHO and the Africa CDC, Magufuli has stated that he was sending a plane to Madagascar to collect an herbal mix that the country was touting as a cure for COVID-19. The herbal mix has not gone through internationally recognized scientific testing.

President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar has claimed that the herbal cure, known in the country as Covid-Organics, shows results within a week and that it has already cured two people so far.

Magufuli, in a speech, said that he was communicating with Madagascar regarding this COVID-19 cure. “They have got a medicine,” he said. “The medicine will be brought in the country so that Tanzanians, too, can benefit.”

"China made defective coronavirus test kits for Tanzania, reveals Africa CDC","(Natural News) The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) revealed Thursday that China was the source of the faulty coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits received by Tanzania. Prior to this, the origin of the test kits — which produced positive results when using samples from a goat and a pawpaw fruit — was unknown.

President John Magufuli ordered an investigation into the imported test kits Sunday. He stated that Tanzanian security forces randomly obtained non-human samples, including ones from pawpaw, a goat and a sheep, in order to evaluate the quality of the kits. These samples were then assigned human names and sent to a laboratory to test for the coronavirus.

Both the kits from the pawpaw and goat tested positive for COVID-19, according to Magufuli. The lab technicians handling the tests were deliberately not informed about the origins of the samples. Based on the results, Magufuli stated that faulty kits meant were marking some people as positive for the coronavirus even though they were not actually infected.

Africa CDC confirms China as the source of faulty kits

Dr. John Nkengasong, head of the Africa CDC, responded to the investigation Thursday. He said that the faulty test kits in question were imported to Africa from China, and then sent to Tanzania by the Africa CDC. These kits were donated by China through the Jack Ma Foundation, a charitable organization founded by billionaire Jack Ma.

Ma, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group and member of the Communist Party of China, has donated thousands of test kits, masks and protective gear to Africa, where the equipment is being used in nations across the continent. Aside from Tanzania, no other African countries have voiced any complaints about the test kits. (Related: Israel’s Health Ministry bans the use of Chinese coronavirus test kits,)

Nkengasong also commented on Magufuli’s allegation that the Africa CDC sent defective kits to Tanzania.

“We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries, and providing them with test kits,” stated the Africa CDC chief. “We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable.”

Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, head of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Africa office, also reacted to Tanzania’s investigation of the test kits.

“We are convinced that the tests that have been provided … both through procurement through [WHO’s Africa office] and those that came through Jack Ma donations, were not contaminated with the virus,” Moeti said in a teleconference with journalists on Thursday.

Testing lab under investigation

Tanzania’s government has formed a team of experts to examine the lab that conducted the tests, stated chief government spokesman Hassan Abbas, and it would relay the outcome of the investigation, once results were in.

“What the president said was based on initial tests run by using animals … to test the veracity of the test results,” said Abbas. “Our worry was based on empirical findings. Once the team finalizes its work we will know the gravity of the lapses in the machines.”

Test issues could affect Africa’s efforts to fight COVID-19

If the veracity of Tanzania’s test on the kits is demonstrated, and the test kits or machines proved to be faulty, it’ll be a huge blow to testing efforts in Africa. While the continent’s testing capacity has expanded sharply, Africa has still only carried out around 685 tests per million people, according to Reuters. In comparison, Europe has carried out nearly 17 million tests, or just under 23,000 per million.

The WHO has warned that there could be as many as 10 million infections in the continent within the next six months. Additionally, Moeti has warned that the disease could “smoulder” in the region, becoming a fixture in the lives of Africans for years to come unless governments take a more proactive approach.

“While COVID-19 likely won’t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will [smolder] in transmission hotspots,” said Moeti. “COVID-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.”

As of press time, Tanzania has 509 cases of the coronavirus and 21 death, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Africa completely unprepared for COVID-19; death numbers could be staggering,"(Natural News) If you thought the coronavirus death toll in places like Italy, Spain and the U.S. was bad, it could really be a drop in the bucket compared to what might happen when the virus takes hold in Africa.

Although the 54 countries in Africa have reported less than 20,000 confirmed cases so far, the continent is considered to be weeks behind Europe, and the rate of increase seen in Europe looked quite similar to Africa’s numbers at this stage. The World Health Organization is warning that there could be mass devastation there given how woefully unprepared most countries are for a medical crisis of this magnitude.

In fact, for every million people in Africa, there are just five ICU beds. Hospital beds are also in short supply, with the entire continent having just 1.8 hospital beds for every 1,000 people; in France, there are 5.98 beds per 1,000 people.

Many Africans are unable to take the precautions that are keeping a lot of us in America and Europe safe, like frequent hand washing. More than half the population lives in highly overcrowded slum areas, and conditions like tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malnutrition are making lots of people there especially vulnerable. With 36 percent of Africans having no access to washing facilities at home, it’s not surprising that experts are predicting absolute devastation.

Social distancing measures have already been put in place in many African countries, with some issuing curfews and travel guidelines and others enacting full lockdowns. South Africa and Rwanda have declared a lockdown and banned unnecessary movements. Uganda has closed its borders, imposed a curfew and banned public transport, while Kenya has also imposed a curfew and restricted movement among populated areas. Nigeria, meanwhile, has imposed lockdowns in key cities like Lagos.

Without additional intervention, The UN Economic Commission for Africa is warning that more than 1.2 billion Africans could become infected with the disease and 33 million could die before the end of the year; the total population on the continent is 1.3 billion. Their best-case scenario would still see the continent registering 122.8 million infections and 300,000 deaths.

They’ve also estimated that as many as 29 million people could be pushed below what is considered the extreme poverty line on account of the virus.

Although Africa, like other continents, will suffer greatly from this disease, there is one small comfort, and that’s the fact that much of its population is young. When you look at the high mortality rate of Italy, it’s important to take into account the fact that 23 percent of that country’s population is older than 65 and therefore falls into the category of highest risk. In Africa, on the other hand, just 2 percent of the population is older than 65. That may help stem the mortality rate to some extent.

Will the coronavirus measures that work elsewhere be effective in Africa?

Some experts have expressed concern that lockdowns might not work as well in many places in Africa as they do in Europe and America. Many people there live day to day and depend on the cash they earn in the market to buy their food, so even a few days of lockdown could plunge them into starvation. Many people may prefer to take their chances and possibly become infected rather than take on the certainty of starvation. Past lockdowns like those meant to curb Ebola in Liberia in 2014 were a disaster and didn’t stop the disease from spreading.

It’s a very complicated situation made worse by the fact that much-needed medical supplies are already in short supply around the world. Countries that might normally come to Africa’s aid during health crises are already struggling with their own problems, and help may be very hard to find.

"Google and Facebook are engineered to spread fear about infections, to keep the public ignorant of how the immune system works","(Natural News) In order to control a person’s mind, alter their behavior, and manipulate their emotions and reactions, that person must first be made ignorant and left feeling helpless, with no way to apply knowledge and independently solve their own problems. In their ignorance, a person is made to feel helpless, abiding by authority’s controls to feel safe. As they give away their own power over their life, they become easily controlled and manipulated. This manipulation leads to compliant, subservient behaviors that serve the interests of those who seek to control, of those who seek to govern over others and poison them for profit.

Big Tech – Google, Facebook etc. – are engineering mass ignorance

Imagine what it would look like if a select entity had the power to make entire populations ignorant – ignorant of their own body, mind and immune system. Imagine if people were told they were facing a “new virus” that they knew nothing about, that their body was incapable of facing. Imagine a feat of manipulation carried out en masse — human minds molded, emotions controlled. This is the reality that is being engineered by Big Tech – primarily Google and Facebook. These entities have created platforms of manipulation that are being used to censor out the most important information on the human immune system, leaving populations clueless and weak, so they can be more readily controlled.

Google has a monopoly on data and uses this data to manipulate what people subconsciously interact with online, what they see in advertisements, and what they are allowed to access in searches and news feeds. Google is already more powerful in terms of its control over people’s lives than almost every government on the planet. For example, go to the Google search engine, type in any three digit number followed by “cases.” Virtually every three digit number will pull up multiple stories about that number of coronavirus cases. It’s all about spreading fear of infection, instead of providing knowledge on how people can live normally and give their body what it needs to overcome potential infections.

Google has devolved from an open access search engine, to a manipulative platform of thought control. According to Google whistleblowers, Google maintains a blacklist, deciding what people can and cannot search for, while burying important information on health topics. Google and Facebook admit they only allow an official narrative to persist on infectious disease. All information that is allowed must be approved and rubber stamped by the World Health Organization.

Dr. Robert Epstein, a behavioral scientist, testified before Congress explaining how Google can use data manipulation and algorithms to manipulate the minds of more than 15 million people in a subsequent election. “And the methods they’re using are invisible, they are subliminal, they are more powerful than most any effects I’ve ever seen in the behavioral science and I’ve been in the behavioral science for almost forty years.”

Censorship and blacklisting of knowledge makes populations vulnerable to pharmaceutical agendas

Zach Vorhies, Google whistle blower and engineer, went public about Google’s internal search engine, which blacklists search terms such as “cancer cures.” Google actively blocks cancer survivor testimony suppressing how cancer can be overcome and burying a vast wealth of scientific studies and knowledge on anti-cancer compounds. This same manipulation is being carried out to spread fear about infections and to keep the public ignorant on how their immune system works. Some of the most important voices have been censored from Big Tech in 2020 because they seek to quell infection fears and provide information that can help people overcome health challenges that plague their mind and body.

As for Facebook: its fact checking arm, PolitiFact, is owned by the Poynter Institute, which has received substantial funding from pharmaceutical companies, Google, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. These controllers use Facebook to censor information that can be applied in the home at the onset of an infection and in the hospital system to speed up recovery, prevent complications and save lives from infectious disease. By blocking information on treatment options and keeping the public ignorant on how their immune system works, these pharmaceutical companies and globalists with a psychopathic plot to vaccinate 7 billion people can more readily carry out their nefarious agendas.

Trump setting the stage for wartime retaliation against communist China regime for launching biological weapon attack against the United States,"(Natural News) President Trump and top Trump administration officials are setting the stage for wartime retaliation against communist China for China’s launching of biological warfare against the United States. The goal of this effort is to cause the collapse of the communist regime, which is widely known as the most evil, dishonest and malicious government on the planet.

Consider what we know so far:

The Wuhan coronavirus was engineered in the Wuhan virology lab in communist China.

The virus was deliberately engineered with “gain-of-function” properties to infect and kill humans.

After releasing the virus, the Chinese government desperately sought to hide its origins by destroying evidence and executing whistleblowers.

At the same time, communist China was conspiring with the WHO to make sure the rest of the world would have a delayed response to the virus by refusing to declare the pandemic a “pandemic.”

During all this, China was aggressively buying up PPE supplies all around the world, making sure other nations would experience extreme shortages in masks and other protective equipment as they tried to handle accelerating outbreaks.

China also leaned on the WHO to criticize any national efforts to block flights from China, characterizing such moves as “racist.” This allowed infected Chinese to rapidly spread the virus around the world.

Even as its own people were widely infected, China continued to run hundreds of flights per day to major cities around the world, including Madrid, Paris, London, New York, Los Angeles, Rio Grande and even Moscow. This was China’s way of exporting the pandemic to other nations .

. China’s goals of disrupting the US economy, hurting Trump’s chances of re-election and creating economic chaos were all achieved in just a few months.

China launched a biological “Pearl Harbor” against the United States

Now, President Trump has correctly described the Wuhan coronavirus attack as a “Pearl Harbor” against the United States, saying, “This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center.” That’s important language to recognize, because it’s the language of war. Similarly, in numerous White House pandemic press briefings, Trump has referred to the pandemic as a “war.”

Now, we can add Peter Navarro’s comments to the mix, with Navarro saying recently on Fox & Friends:

“We are at war, make no mistake about that. The Chinese unleashed a virus on the world.”

As RT reports:

The rhetoric against China from both Republicans and White House officials has become especially accusatory in recent days.

This is on top of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repeatedly insisting there is “enormous evidence” that the Wuhan coronavirus was engineered in a Chinese lab. He also warns that China tried to hide the origins of the virus.

As The Independent reports:

Mr Pompeo’s statements about the origins of the virus mirror the words of his boss, Donald Trump, who claimed last Thursday that he has seen evidence the coronavirus originated from a medical laboratory in Wuhan.

“We can confirm that the Chinese Communist Party did all that it could to make sure that the world didn’t learn in a timely fashion about what was taking place,” Mr Pompeo said. “We’ve seen the fact that they kicked the journalists out. We saw the fact that those who were trying to report on this, medical professionals inside of China, were silenced. They shut down reporting.In March, Beijing tightened its censorship process surrounding medical research of the virus and its origins. It has also taken down various scientific research papers on the virus that were previously published on the web.”

Finally, former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, an extremely high-IQ individual who has deep intelligence contacts in Taiwan, is now saying the communist regime (CCP) is headed for collapse.

In an interview with The Epoch Times, Bannon says: (emphasis added)

We don’t have to have the economy in China collapse. What we have to do is have the Chinese communist party collapse…

You may have some perturbations as China reorganizes and gets a new government. It will be like Eastern Europe and these places after the fall of the Soviet union. But think how great it would be with the Chinese people being free, having democracy and having true freedom and not having to have a firewall, not having to have social credit scores and not having everybody like the great hero, Dr. Li (who had to) face torture and had to sign a confession that he was a rumor monger. All that goes away. May the economy go down slightly? Yeah. The economy may go down. It’s not going to be perfect at first, but look, the economy is collapsing in China anyway because of the actions of the Chinese communist party and what they did in this pandemic.

The first quarter in China has been terrible. The second quarter has been terrible. The factories aren’t back up and the workers don’t feel safe. Remember we have another whole wave of this in China and it’s not affecting the guys in Beijing because they have total quarantine. If you go out to the fifth ring or sixth ring, you can’t get back into the area around the forbidden city. It’s like a quarantine, right? Because they want to protect themselves. They know how deadly this virus is. So this shows you the hypocrisy of the leadership of the Chinese communist party.

That’s what this pandemic, the good that can come out of this pandemic is the freedom of the Chinese people. And people have to understand if you support the Chinese communist party, you’re racist, if you support the Chinese communist party, you’re a xenophobe because you are supporting the worst people on earth to suppress the 1.4 billion people in China. And you’re going to be held accountable. Anybody that backs the regime is going to be held accountable. Okay? There’s absolutely no doubt this regime is going to fall. Just like the Nazis fell just like Mussolini and the fascists fell, just like the commissars and the Soviet union fell. They always fall. The Chinese communist party is the next one to get kicked into the dustbin of history.

It begs the question: Does Bannon know something about imminent action against China?

It’s all leading up to war against China

The upshot of all this is that Trump and his top officials are setting the stage for retaliatory action against China. Any form of retaliation would be justified under the truth that China launched the first attack wave against the United States by releasing the Wuhan coronavirus and then deliberately spreading it around the world, including to the United States.

The bioweapons attack has caused trillions of dollars in economic damage in the United States alone, and it has killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world — a number that will almost certainly turn to millions of deaths once the virus completes its rampage across Africa, Mexico and South America.

When attacked with a weapon of mass destruction from an enemy nation, the United States has many options for retaliatory strikes:

Economic weapons such as embargoes and trade restrictions.

Financial weapons such as nullifying US Treasuries held by China.

Geopolitical weapons such as increasing weapon funding and supply for Taiwan.

In an even more enticing scenario, the USA could end its official recognition of China and switch its recognition to Taiwan as the rightful China.

Cyber weapons, including cyber attacks on China’s infrastructure.

Kinetic weapons, including targeted cruise missile strikes on China’s virology labs.

Nuclear weapons, which might include tactical nukes that target communist government strongholds.

What’s clear is that before war is initiated, a war of words is used to establish the justification of the real war to follow. And that war of words is what we’re seeing now from Navarro, Pompeo and Trump himself. It’s a strong indication that acts of war are in the works and might be deployed without warning.

My recent interview with JR Nyquist provides further evidence that war with China may be imminent:

Once China collapses, so will the Big Tech censorship regime that takes orders from Beijing

It is time, after all, for the world to isolate communist China and deliberately work to achieve the collapse of that evil, anti-human regime. The collapse of China would also set off enormous shockwaves of freedom around the world as China’s puppets — which include Google, Facebook, Twitter, the Vatican and more — all experience a simultaneous disconnect from the commie bosses who tell them what to do.

At least one-third of the US Congress would also experience sudden withdrawal, as they are communist puppets who do the bidding of China. And Sen. Feinstein’s office in California would find itself with nothing to do, since it only serves the interests of China, too.

The bottom line is that communist China’s existence is irreconcilable with human freedom, and the implosion of the communist regime would not only set free the 1.4 billion Chinese who live under the oppression of tyranny, it would also end communist China’s infiltration and control over countless institutions around the world that are now allied against humanity: Big Tech, the Vatican, US universities, the US Congress, Hollywood and so on.

In essence, China is the greatest enemy of humanity, and if Trump, Pompeo and others were to find a way to obliterate the communist Chinese regime while freeing the Chinese people, it would be the greatest gift to humankind that we could possibly imagine.

Cold war brewing between the US and China as coronavirus outbreak spreads,"(Natural News) The tensions that have mounted since the start of the global coronavirus pandemic have slowly pushed the U.S. and China closer to a new cold war. The political pressures stemming from the pandemic have strengthened hard-liners while making it harder for leaders to back away from escalation.

As the virus has killed thousands and savaged economies around the world, officials in Washington and Beijing have continued to heap blame on each other for the virus. Early on, President Donald Trump often referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus.”

Meanwhile, Chinese state-owned media and political operatives have slammed the statements of America’s political elites as being “racist and xenophobic.” Beijing has even gone as far as to spin allegations that the epidemic was started by the U.S. military.

The outbreak is stirring anger in both countries

Officials in Washington have quietly pressed for international censure of China’s culpability in the ongoing pandemic. At the same time, they’ve seized upon the crisis to attack the manufacturing and other economic ties that have been built between the countries over the past 40 years.

As the outbreak shut down imports from China, many companies found themselves unable to procure the goods they needed to sell to make money. As a result, many U.S. companies started to rethink their supply chains and make plans to move their manufacturing outside of China before the economy ground to a halt.

All the while, the tariffs that President Trump imposed on billions of dollars worth of goods from China — and corresponding counter-tariffs from Beijing — remain in place. This has added to the cost of trade while many businesses struggle to stay afloat.

The economic toll seems to have pushed bipartisan support for President Trump’s anti-China message in both Congress and in corporate America. Many in the latter have long been disillusioned with the relationship, especially as Beijing continues to refuse to prevent its companies from appropriating the intellectual property and know-how of American firms.

Another factor contributing to the growing disenfranchisement with China has been Beijing’s continued crackdowns on dissent and human rights, as well as its aggressive military moves in the South China Sea.

In China, on the other hand, U.S. criticism of the country, as well as the economic toll inflicted by the tariffs, has also stirred waves of nationalistic resentment toward the latter.

This anger, combined with the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) massive response to fight the epidemic, seems to have strengthened President Xi Jinping’s hold on power, making it easier for him to pursue further crackdowns on dissent.

People in China also chafe at President Trump’s effort to blame the pandemic on the nation, seeing it as both unfair and factually wrong. To them, the CPC’s draconian isolation of Hubei province and other hot spots is a model for how to contain and conquer the disease. They also see China as having reached out to other countries to help them as its own crisis has seemingly abated. (Related: “Recovered” coronavirus patients in China are testing positive a second time.)

According to David Bachman, a China specialist at the University of Washington in Seattle, the widely accepted narrative within China is that the country is “if not the savior of the world — at least sort of doing more than its fair share to help the rest of the world.”

On both sides, public resentment is likely to be intensified by the rising economic cost of the pandemic.

Economic pain could make compromise more difficult

The economies of both nations are expected to see their sharpest drops in decades, as businesses get crippled, and millions of people lose their jobs. Political leaders face an unprecedented crisis in which conventional stimulus packages and other time-honored economic policies look to be ineffective.

According to analysts, the economic pain will likely make it difficult for both sides to make any compromise, even if a de-escalation could benefit both of them.

“I don’t think there’s any way in hell things get better from here,” said Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “An increasingly authoritarian China, mixed with a global growth downturn, mixed with a domestic recession, mixed with a populist president, mixed with an election year, equals an increasingly factious discourse on China.”

China’s economy is expected to suffer its slowest growth in more than 40 years. This could threaten the country’s political stability if the CPC fails to make good on its compact with the masses to continue to improve their economic well-being in exchange for their compliance with an often oppressive authoritarian system.

However, there are signs that China’s economy could fare better than experts in the West are projecting. According to Nicolas Lardy, a China economy expert at the Petersen Institute for International Economics, Chinese factories have resumed their operations, and power usage has returned to 95 percent of what it was this time last year.

In addition to this, Beijing hasn’t felt the need to spur economic growth with massive credit, nor has it provided anything close to the $2 trillion relief package that Washington passed. Had Beijing thought they were headed to a major economic downturn, Lardy explained, they would have injected a lot more stimulus than it already has.

Coronavirus killed the trade deal that could have eased tensions

Back in January, there was some hope that tensions would be eased thanks to a large trade deal struck by the two sides. As part of the deal, the Chinese promised to buy millions of dollars more in American farm products and other goods.

Thanks to the pandemic, however, that trade deal “is already dead in the water,” states Backman. “There’s no possible way that the targets now are going to be met. And so that’s going to be a source of dissatisfaction on the U.S. side.”

The global pandemic “has demonstrated the impossibility of the U.S. and China being coupled closely together,” explained Clyde Prestowitz, former counselor to the Secretary of Commerce during the Reagan administration. “The notion that free trade and globalization are going to tame China and make it more democratic, etcetera, I think this has shown that’s bull.”

"NIH spent more than $700 million in taxpayer money to develop coronavirus pharmaceuticals, vaccines and bioweapons","(Natural News) For the past almost 20 years, the United States government has been using your tax dollars (assuming you’re an American taxpayer) to fund research and development into vaccines and other pharmaceuticals for the coronavirus family of pathogens. And if history is any indicator, the end result of this massive financial disbursement will be obscene profits for Big Pharma, and expensive drugs for you and your family.

A new report by Public Citizen explains that the “race” has been on to develop new drug-based treatments for coronaviruses ever since the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis of 2002, followed by MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) in 2012, and now the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19).

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the report explains, has played a “singular role” in making sure that your hard-earned income makes it into the coffers of the pharmaceutical industry, which continues to argue that its monopoly-based patent system for synthetic treatments “is the most effective tool to reward and incentivize innovation.”

Big Pharma further argues that, despite having to rely upon the general public to fund its self-centered R&D efforts, this is all worthwhile because it “fulfills the promise of breakthroughs in treatments and cures for … scores of debilitating or life-threatening illnesses around the world.”

Keep in mind that unpatented natural remedies remain largely off-limits because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is bed-buddies with Big Pharma, prohibits their use under the guise that they’re “unsubstantiated” and “unproven” for medicinal use.

The only option, in other words, are patented synthetics, which wouldn’t even exist were it not for back-door dealings that transfer the wealth of American taxpayers into the coffers of the pharmaceutical industry, which Public Citizen argues isn’t even putting it to good use when it comes to the fight against infectious diseases.

“… the monopoly model has not driven significant industry investment in infectious diseases, including coronaviruses,” the report explains. “Last year, there were only six active coronavirus clinical trials involving pharmaceutical companies. All of them depended crucially on public funding.”

Listen below as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how the release of the new Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) was an intentional deployment by communist China of a deadly bioweapon aimed at the destruction of America:

Big Pharma doesn’t care about helping people, only about lining its pockets with cash

The problem with trying to fight infectious diseases using the typical pharmaceutical model is that there’s much more profit to be had in developing “blockbuster” treatments for persistent illnesses as opposed to isolated outbreaks. Thus, Big Pharma is almost solely focused on the latter, public health be damned.

When it comes to the fundamentals of the pharmaceutical industry, in other words, it’s all about the money, baby. Big Pharma executives couldn’t care less if millions or even billions of people die, just so long as the profits continue to flow from other lucrative drug offerings, including childhood vaccines that are now mandated in many areas with minimal exceptions.

Now, if Big Pharma can somehow be assured by Big Fed that people will be forced at gunpoint to receive a patented coronavirus vaccine at some point in the future, then that’s a whole different story. If this were the case, every pharmaceutical company in America would be rushing to create their own varieties due to the surety of windfall profits.

“The public sector has helped drive the CoVid-19 response,” Public Citizen states. “We cannot rely on industry’s monopoly model to deliver the medicines we need.”

"The same media liars who ran total fearmonger stories over the MEASLES nonsense are now claiming the coronavirus pandemic is nothing, and that WE are fearmongers","(Natural News) Every time anybody in America gets the measles, the mass media go into their scripted frenzy, and the vaccine industry pushes out their propaganda via the CDC hub of lies and deception. Get the measles vaccine or catch the measles and die from the measles – that’s the message. Then CNN and WebMD plaster pictures of some worse-case scenario, probably from the 1970s or something, and we’re all supposed to panic and run out for the latest MMR II combo jab full of neurotoxins, including MSG and human abortion cells.

Now, with coronavirus infecting more than 70,000 and killing at least 1700, we’re all told it’s contained and quarantined. It’s all under control so just go back to work at the factory, pay those taxes and keep spending the rest of your money on beer, corn sugar, and pharmaceuticals. That’s right: CoVid-19 isn’t like the measles yet, because there’s no vaccine to sell to the public, all laced with everything that makes you sick, dumb and more susceptible to the “killer cold.”

The “killer cold” virus pandemic is infecting us – should we all panic?

That’s what it is, you know, this latest version of a mutated nightmare that was genetically modified and mutated in a lab and then stolen or sold to the highest bidder. It’s a killer cold virus, like the flu, but the people who are dying off are those who already have decimated immune systems from eating toxins, drinking chemical water, breathing pollution, getting injected with vaccines, and taking flora-destroying prescription medications. Is it sinking in yet? – the fact that measles is considered one of the deadliest diseases by the sick care industry of the USA, but coronavirus is nothing to worry about, question, or even talk about?

The money-making machine (a toxic immunization jab that doesn’t work) hasn’t been “patented” and released to the public, so go right out and catch that killer cold. Pay no attention to the 400 million people quarantined in China. It’s all under control over there, just like the nuclear radioactive wastewater at the Fukushima plant in Japan. Nothing to see here. Go back to work America.

They say the best way to end the measles scare is to just catch it, and be done with it forever, so what about CoVid-19?

So, who are the real conspiracy theorists now? The mass media and sick care industry never tell the truth about immunity. That is one thing we know for sure. They tell us babies have no immune system at all and need 60 vaccines by age 6 to even survive. They tell us all elderly people are weak, with brittle bones, compromised immune systems, and that dementia is natural aging and it’s inherited. Can you say population control?

We’re all supposed to be scared to death of the the measles, flu, Zika virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), and even chicken pox. There’s a vaccine for everything, and if you don’t get it, you are a science denier, a vaccine skeptic, a threat to human life on Earth. Now, don’t look, but coronavirus is set to infect 80 percent of the population of this planet, and guess who’s more likely to die from this killer cold? Oh, the hypocrisy of Western Medicine.

So, let’s say tomorrow there’s an outbreak of the Measles at Disney Land or Disney World or in a Disney Movie — should we all rush out and get a new measles shot, even though it’s the vaccination itself that helps spread the disease via human shedders? Maybe that’s EXACTLY how the globalists plan on spreading CoVid-19 coronavirus, by making everyone paranoid and emotional one day so they’ll all rush out and get injected with the killer cold virus. This, my friends, looks like biological warfare purposely waged.

You can thank the Chinese Communist Party for the coronavirus epidemic,"(Natural News) Meeting with the head of the World Health Organization Tuesday, President Xi Jinping did his best to pretend that the deadly coronavirus epidemic now raging in China was under control. “I have been in command” of the situation from the beginning, he said. His government would “release information on the virus in a timely manner,” because “The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide.”

(Article by Steven W. Mosher republished from LifeSiteNews.com)

Listening to Xi, you don’t know whether to laugh or cry.

The truth is that Communist Party officials have been playing “hide the demon” for two months now. For weeks after the first coronavirus cases were reported, they pretended that it didn’t exist.

Then we were told that the coronavirus originated in an open-air market, where animals were being slaughtered for sale to customers who like their wild game fresh. Perhaps. But there have also been suggestions that the virus may have escaped from a People’s Liberation Army Biowarfare unit located just a few miles away from the epicenter of the epidemic.

Either way, the first wave of cases in December was hushed up.

Even when the number of people who had come down with the coronavirus became too large to hide by early January, officials continually minimized the seriousness of the disease to their own people—and to the world.

In the meantime, because they were not given timely information about the seriousness of the problem, the people of Wuhan went on contracting and spreading the virus among themselves for weeks. Then, just as the virus was reaching epidemic proportions in Wuhan, the Chinese New Year began.

Every year, the largest migration on the planet takes place in China. By long tradition, hundreds of millions of people go home for the lunar new year celebrations.

In the days leading up to the holiday, no fewer than five million residents of Wuhan got in cars, buses, trains, and planes and went home for the holidays. The effect of this diaspora was to carry the coronavirus to every corner of China, and to many surrounding countries as well. It is an epidemiological nightmare.

Only after the first cases of coronavirus were being reported in a dozen other Chinese cities did deceitful Communist officials finally impose a quarantine on Wuhan’s 11 million people. They have since expanded it to some 17 other cities in Hubei province with a total population of 40-plus million. It is the largest quarantine in human history—but it is still too little and too late. This is the real scandal.

Even today, as the epidemic has spread throughout China, the Chinese authorities are still lying—about the number of infections, about the number of deaths, and maybe even about the origins of the deadly virus. The claim that there have been to date only 170 deaths and 7,700 infections is laughable given the other reports that are coming out of the country.

Take the January 28 directive issued by China’s Ministry of Public Security, which ordered all police departments throughout the country to make “wartime preparations.” The police are to help “control the disease” by enforcing quarantine orders and helping to speed the distribution of medical supplies, while at the same time “maintaining social stability” by “severely” punishing any public or online reporting about the spread of the epidemic.

Does that sound like China is on the verge of declaring a national emergency to you? It does to me.

Despite the police clampdown on social media reports on the epidemic, a few hints of how bad things really are have managed to leak out from behind the Great Firewall. Consider this stunner from the Wuhan authorities.

“The [Wuhan] city government and Hubei Provincial Civil Affairs Ministry have dispatched vehicles, staff, and protective gear to each funeral house [in Wuhan].” The post went on to offer “free cremation for the corpses of coronavirus victims” who died on January 26 or later.

The reason the city was deploying these new resources, it said, was “To improve the capacity of transporting and dealing with corpses” (!).

I don’t know about you, but this doesn’t sound to me like something they would do if the official death toll of 170 or so was anywhere close to accurate. The post obviously didn’t please the censors either, because an hour later the above sentences were deleted from the text.

As far as Xi himself, until now he has maintained a sphinxlike silence on the epidemic that has the province of Hubei in a death grip, even as lower-level officials like Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang have had to fall on their swords. Two days ago Chinese premier Li Keqiang finally visited the city, but Xi still hasn’t gone himself.

Any other world leader who did not personally visit the scene of such an unfolding disaster would be crucified in his national media. Xi has little to worry about on that front, however, since his state-controlled media exists not to report the news, but to make him and the Party look good.

Of course, with long lines of the sick lining up outside hospitals, that’s getting increasingly hard to do.

General Secretary Xi Jinping may speak of the “demon,” but in the view of many in China, the “demon” is hiding in plain sight. It is the Chinese Communist Party itself, and the culture of corruption and deceit that it has fostered.

One final comment: The Chinese Party-State probably spends a trillion dollars a year monitoring and surveilling, policing and re-educating its population. The cost of incarcerating over a million Uyghurs in concentration camps alone must run into the tens of billions. The cost of persecuting tens of millions of Catholics and other Christians probably runs billions more.

If they put a fraction of the money they spend on their police state into public health, and actually “released information in a timely manner,” as Xi promised, they would have been able to stop this epidemic in its tracks.

But that’s not the way that Leftists roll, is it?

Fortunately, those of us in the West live in democracies, with an open and free press, and health officials who put people, rather than politics, first. The few cases of the disease we now have will be effectively contained and Xi’s “demon” will pass us by.

But pity the poor Chinese.

"US military pandemic plans activated; nation must prepare for “thousands of cases” of the coronavirus to arrive, warns biowarfare expert","(Natural News) Over the last two weeks, I have repeatedly warned that the nCoV coronavirus strain is right now being harvested by enemies of America (North Korea, Iran, China, etc.) and readied for deployment as a weapon system against the United States of America. Until today, I seem to have been the only person in the world who dared point out the obvious.

But now, the executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, speaking at a Senate Home Security committee just yesterday, confirmed this obvious point, saying, “We have to plan for the possibility that we have thousands of cases.”

His name is Asha George, and he was one of five experts who testified before the U.S. Senate, reports The Epoch Times. Another expert was former FDA director Scott Gottlieb, who warned that unrestrained immigration would bring the virus to America:

We should be leaning in very aggressively to try to broaden diagnostic screening right now, particularly in communities where there is a lot of immigration; where these efforts could emerge to identify them early enough; that they’ll be small enough; that we can intervene to prevent more epidemic spread in this country.

Gottlieb also added that because the virus spread during its asymptomatic incubation phase, airport screening is only catching 1 out of every 4 infections. This means airport screening, just as we have repeated warned here, is largely just “security theater.”

U.S. military Northern Command issues executive order to prepare the military for a global coronavirus pandemic

In addition to various U.S. officials warning the Senate about the coming wave of coronavirus infections, the United States military, Northern Command, just issued an executive order commanding troops to initiate military pandemic plans, according to an article published in MilitaryTimes.com.

The plans, “include ordering commanders to prepare for widespread outbreaks and confining service members with a history of travel to China,” reports Military Times:

The Navy and Marine Corps messages, issued Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, reference an executive order directing U.S. Northern Command to implement the Department of Defense Global Campaign plan for Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Diseases 3551-13.

The document serves as the Pentagon’s blueprint for planning and preparing for widespread dispersion of influenza and previously unknown diseases.

U.S. Northern Command said Wednesday it was directed the Joint Staff Feb. 1 to commence “prudent planning” in their assigned role synchronizing the department’s plans for pandemic flu and disease.

The global pandemic just got militarized, in other words.

China just essentially declared military martial law and activated a full military response against the coronavirus pandemic

Making things even more interesting, China’s CDC just issued a series of military orders that essentially place the entire nation under military martial law.

Detailed in this executive order released by the Chinese government, China’s new “wartime” declaration calls on biological weapons laboratories in China to “put an end to pathogenic samples being stolen, leaked or lost.”

Much of China’s declaration centers around wartime commands that demand absolute loyalty and zero errors in logistics and control of local regions. Here’s a rough translation from one of the directives (directive five):

The current situation of epidemic prevention and control is extremely serious, the responsibility of prevention and control is heavier than that of Mount Tai. With the coming battle, all Party branches should think and launch, unite the masses and commit fully to the role of battle fortress; cadres at all levels should lead by example, dare to take on the role and give full commitment to the leading role; and each Party member should rush forward, shoulder the heavy burden, and give full commitment to the role of pioneer and model. All Party branches, branches and cadres at all levels should earnestly fulfill their main responsibilities, and the disciplinary committee shall fulfill its supervisory responsibilities to ensure the smooth flow of decrees and the prohibition of the operation.

If you can make any sense of that, you might fit in well with a communist society, which at its core is rooted in total insanity and delusion. In fact, the very structure of communism makes society highly vulnerable to pandemics, since no truth tellers are allowed to warn anyone about the outbreak. Censorship gets people killed, both in communist China and in the USA where the evil tech giants are also complicit in covering up the truth about the coronavirus pandemic.

Bottom line: Governments of the world know this is going global and they are activating their military forces to be prepared for anything

So, as is now becoming rather obvious, the coronavirus pandemic is going global. Every nation that’s paying attention is ordering its military to activate pandemic readiness measures.

U.S. military commanders and national defense experts are already well aware that the coronavirus will inevitably be deployed against the United States of America as a biological weapon. They are also aware that deliberate contamination efforts cannot be stopped in any way whatsoever. There is no defense against an infected person covertly entering the USA and walking around a city, infecting public surfaces and shared air in public transport vessels such as trains or subways.

This means America will almost certainly find itself in a rapidly worsening pandemic situation in the coming months, and medical martial law will no doubt be declared in the USA as well. Expect full-blown quarantines, gunpoint arrests of suspected carriers, the complete revocation of all civil rights (including the Second Amendment, if they can get away with it) and mandatory coronavirus vaccines once commercial availability is met.

In other words, America will sooner or later be turned into a medical police state, and everybody at the highest levels of the government, the CDC and the military is already fully aware of this. Just like in China, quarantine death camps will be called “hospitals,” too.

No one in a position of power will admit the truth, because the public can’t handle the truth

As all this is unfolding at the highest levels, the public is being kept in the dark so that they “don’t panic” by learning the truth.

We’re basically in a situation where a metaphorical 100-mile wide asteroid is plunging toward New York City at a relative velocity of 10,000 m/s, and the impact is triple confirmed but nobody in the government wants to alarm the public, since it’s pointless to warn people about an event of such magnitude. (That would be a planetary extinction event.)

The coronavirus won’t cause mass extinction, but it could very easily cause devastating, even catastrophic disruptions to human-driven economies, resulting in waves of death, chaos and instability that threaten the very existence of ruling governments. Once the full impact of the virus becomes realized, today’s delusional stock market bubble will absolutely implode, and that’s a result the Trump administration doesn’t want to see happen, at least not before the election.

Things are about to get very interesting, in other words. Plus, it’s an election year, and that’s when the party in power wants to project the illusion that everything’s awesome.

Truth be told, everything isn’t awesome. In fact, it’s downright apocalyptic to anyone who can do the math and see where this is going.

Just remember, we told you first. Now everybody else in the establishment media is catching up, as usual. If you want to stay ahead of the sheeple, read NaturalNews.com to get the news today that the rest of the media will finally come to realize two weeks later.",2/13/20 0:00,,0
Sen. Cotton DEMANDS China prove that coronavirus isn’t a biological weapon as outbreak continues to spread and kill,"(Natural News) In recent days, the very same Left-wing establishment media beholden to the deep state and for years reported the “Trump-Russia collusion” hoax even in the face of conflicting evidence were triggered by suggestions that the coronavirus could be part of a Chinese biological weapon that simply got away from the People’s Liberation Army.

But this week the questions over whether the virus is linked to a dangerous weapons program belonging to Beijing are getting a second look, and from none other than a Republican senator not noted for crazy conspiracies or hyperbole.

As Zero Hedge reports, Sen. Tom Cotton, a former U.S. Army infantry officer with two combat tours and a law degree from Harvard, raised the issue anew as China continues to try to contain the spread of the virus, which has now reached the United States.

Indeed, adding further credence to the theory, a pair of ‘mainstream’ financial publications have also raised the question, the news site noted: Is coronavirus a Chinese bioweapon?

Zero Hedge noted:

Is it merely a coincidence that the Canadian scientist at the center of a bio-espionage probe was recently found dead in Africa, as we reported last week? Or that a doctor who helped draft a critical international bioweapons convention has said that the virus might be tied to “biological warfare?”

Or an Israeli bioweapons expert?

Cotton believes that Chinese leaders must step up and answer these and other questions, especially after he was accused of engaging in “xenophobia” against Chinese people — a ridiculous assertion and one meant only to deflect — by China’s Ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai.

In fact, as The National Sentinel reported this week, Cui was asked about Cotton’s concerns regarding a potential bioweapon on a Sunday network news magazine and pointedly did not directly deny it.

Outbreak of virus occurred near location of a ‘super lab’

CBS News’ Margaret Brennan said to the ambassador, “That’s an extraordinary charge. How do you respond to that?”

“I think it’s true that a lot is still unknown and our scientists, Chinese scientists, American scientists, scientists of other countries are doing their best to learn more about the virus, but it’s very harmful,” Cui said.

“It’s very dangerous to stir up suspicion, rumors and spread them among the people. For one thing, this will create panic. Another thing that it will fend up racial discrimination, xenophobia, all these things, that will really harm our joint efforts to combat the virus,” he continued.

“Of course, there are all kinds of speculation and rumors,” Cui said. “There are people who are saying that these virus are coming from some- some military lab, not of China, maybe in the United States. How — how can we believe all these crazy things?”

When pressed by Brennan as to where the virus did come form, Cui answered, “We still don’t know yet.”

So — not a real denial.

On a separate-but-related subject, Cui was also asked by Brennan about what happened to Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who disappeared after he began covering the outbreak of the virus at ground zero in Wuhan City.

His response: “I have never heard of this guy, so I don’t have any information to share with you.”

But a U.S. journalist knew about ‘this guy.’

As for Cotton, he took to Twitter to make some statements of his own. For instance, he pointed out the “fact” the Chinese government lied about the coronavirus starting in a Wuhan food market.

[email protected], here’s what’s not a conspiracy, not a theory: Fact: China lied about virus starting in Wuhan food market https://t.co/Jgpy1Oh75Y — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 9, 2020

He also noted another “fact” that a “super-lab” just happens to be located a few miles from the market.

“Where did it start? We don’t know. But the burden of proof is on you & fellow communists,” he wrote.”

Why is the World Health Organization engaged in bioweapons research?,"(Natural News) In a recent interview with Infowars‘ Owen Shroyer, Dr. Francis Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law, talked about novel coronavirus, the Biosafety Level 4 laboratory (BSL-4) in Wuhan, China, where it appears to have originated, and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) questionable involvement in bioweapons research.

It’s the latter topic that’s of particular interest for this article, as the WHO is supposed to be an agency that responds to global health crises, not creates them. But it would seem as though the WHO not only knew in advance that 2019-nCoV was created in a lab, but may have also been involved in its creation in the first place.

If this is true, it would constitute a serious crime against humanity, not to mention a total violation of the Geneva Convention. But that’s what we’re up against, here, as Boyle warns that the WHO has been knowingly complicit in unleashing what’s shaping up to be one of the worst global pandemics in decades.

“The Chinese government has been lying about it from the get-go, covering it up, just like they did on SARS,” Boyle stated during the interview, which you can watch below and at Brighteon.com. “The WHO is in on it. You can’t believe anything the WHO is telling you because this is a WHO special designated research lab. The WHO is up to its eyeballs in biological warfare research.”

In other words, the BSL-4 lab in Wuhan where many now suspect novel coronavirus originated was actually designated for such purposes by the WHO itself. And what’s worse, there are a number of BSL-4 labs here in America as well, which is why Boyle drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was unanimously approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law by the late President George H.W. Bush.

As for President Trump’s current handling of the crisis, or lack thereof, Boyle blames those surrounding Trump for not giving him the full scoop about what’s going on. In Boyle’s view, there are evil factions here on our soil that, just like in communist China, are trying to cover up the truth about what really happening.

“I don’t believe President Trump is getting proper scientific advice about how dangerous this really is and that it is an offensive biological warfare weapon,” Boyle stated during the interview. “Basically, he has surrounding him all these scientists who have been up to their eyeballs in this dirty biological warfare work here in the United States.”

“So, I have no idea what they’re telling President Trump, but I suspect they’re spinning it to protect their own rear ends here. In my opinion, every BSL-4 laboratory here in America should be shut down immediately.”

Boyle also discussed a report put out by the GreatGameIndia journal that exposes novel coronavirus as a Chinese biowarfare agent, and not some random disease supposedly being spread by snakes and bats.

“On biowarfare programs they want to cover up, they always blame it on bats,” Boyle contends. “You know, bats have been around forever, so give me a break.”

Francis Boyle’s contentions about novel coronavirus being a Chinese bioweapon constitute “synthetic news” in the eyes of Big Tech

You’ll want to watch the entire interview with Boyle because it’s a real eye-opener, and something you won’t find anywhere in the mainstream media. That’s because any information that even remotely suggests foul play with this whole saga has been deemed “synthetic news” by Google, Twitter, Facebook and the rest of Big Tech, along with communist China which wants to be fully in charge of the narrative.

There’s an obvious cover-up going on with this whole thing, which Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, also discussed during a recent episode of The Health Ranger Report, which you can listen to below (you can also access this video directly at Brighteon.com):

Keep in mind that Boyle isn’t the only one talking about this. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas has also publicly warned that the official narrative surrounding coronavirus is questionable, at best. At worst, it’s an absolute farce that’s keeping everyone in the dark about how a viral pandemic has been unleashed not by wildlife but by evil men and women who develop and test biological weapons for a living.

“As one epidemiologist said: ‘That virus went into the seafood market before it came out of the seafood market.’ We still don’t know where it originated,” Sen. Cotton is quoted as saying.

“I would note that Wuhan also has China’s only bio-safety level four super laboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.”

US reports first case of COVID-19 reinfection,"(Natural News) A 25-year old Nevada man is the nation’s first case of COVID-19 reinfection. This makes the U.S. the fourth country to report COVID-19 reinfection. Just last week, the world’s first case of COVID-19 reinfection was reported in Hong Kong, followed by cases in Belgium and the Netherlands. The new case is detailed in an online preprint on the Social Science Research Network. In addition, the study has also been submitted to The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

According to the case, the young adult first tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-April. While he recovered, he got sick again in late May and this time, his illness was more severe. Other cases of reinfection, in comparison, were either milder than the patient’s initial bout or even asymptomatic.

Still, despite what happened to the man in Nevada, it’s too early to draw conclusions on the matter.

“It is important to note, that this is a singular finding,” explained Dr. Mark Pandori, director of the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory and a co-author of the case study. “It does not provide any information to us with regard to the generalizability of this phenomenon.”

Based on genetic sequencing, researchers indicated that the Nevada man’s case is a true reinfection, as he was infected with a slightly different strain of SARS-CoV-2 than his initial infection. It’s still unclear why he was reinfected; a theory that the team is looking at is that the person’s initial exposure to the virus did not give him immunity. (Related: Scientists say coronavirus has higher affinity for human cells than bat cells – does this prove it was laboratory made?)

Reinfection a rare – but real – possibility

Earlier studies on COVID-19 have shown that people generally develop a healthy immune response post-infection. This includes antibodies, which block pathogens from infecting cells, and T cells, immune cells that help wipe out the virus. The body’s immune response also creates “memories” of the virus, protecting the body from a second attack.

This means that people who had a COVID-19 infection are protected from another case for some time. For other coronaviruses, these usually last for less than a year to around three years. Experts, however, are still figuring out how long immunity will last with SARS-CoV-2 until people start getting reinfected. This includes understanding the mechanisms behind a person’s immunity against SARS-CoV-2, as well as measurable levels of antibodies or T cells that signal a person has developed an immunity – better known as correlates of protection.

According to experts, while cases like that of the Nevada man are rare, it still raises the possibility of being infected a second time around.

“The evidence so far suggests that if you’ve been infected and recovered, then you’re protected for some period of time,” added Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. Jha, who wasn’t part of the case study, also noted that researchers like him are also looking for cases of people that have been reinfected by the coronavirus.

Nevada reinfection is unique

It’s worth noting that immunity doesn’t just vanish – it loses its strength over time. According to experts, this means that the body may not be able to defend against the virus, but it may prevent a person from getting really sick. The COVID-19 reinfection in Hong Kong demonstrates what the immune system is supposed to do, they added. The man initially had a mild case of COVID-19, but he was asymptomatic the second time.

“You’d expect the second time around people to have much milder or ideally no symptoms,” said Jha.

But that wasn’t the case with the Nevada reinfection. According to the researchers, the man showed typical symptoms – headache, cough, sore throat, nausea and diarrhea – during his initial bout with COVID-19. His symptoms cleared up after 10 days, and he tested negative for the virus. A month later, however, he reported feeling sick again with the same symptoms – plus dizziness. Unlike his first infection, his symptoms did not clear up. In fact, these became markedly worse, as he needed help breathing after his oxygen levels fell dangerously low. He tested positive again for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

But if the current trend of reinfections means that a person can be reinfected in such a short amount of time, it can spell trouble for vaccine developers, Pandori added. “After one recovers from COVID-19, we still do not know how much immunity is built up, how long it may last, or how well antibodies play a role in protection against a reinfection.”

The U.S. currently has over 6 million COVID-19 cases and more than 183,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

AOC demands coronavirus relief money be used to pay “reparations” to “black” and “brown” people because the disease is racist and bigoted or something,"(Natural News) In keeping with the far-Left Democratic mantra of never letting a good crisis go to waste, freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (DS-N.Y.) is making an odd and inappropriate demand on a chunk of relief money aimed at stemming the financial and economic damage caused by Wuhan coronavirus-related business closures.

Because the coronavirus is ‘racist’ and ‘bigoted’ — or something to that effect — she believes that “black and brown people” ought to get a bigger share of the pie because…”inequality.”

As Paul Joseph Watson of Summit News reported:

[AOC] has called for coronavirus “reparations” for black and brown people, claiming that “environmental racism” is an “underlying health condition.”

Yes, really.

COVID deaths are disproportionately spiking in Black + Brown communities. Why? Because the chronic toll of redlining, environmental racism, wealth gap, etc. ARE underlying health conditions. Inequality is a comorbidity. COVID relief should be drafted with a lens of reparations. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 3, 2020

“COVID deaths are disproportionately spiking in Black + Brown communities,” tweeted the New York socialist. “Why? Because the chronic toll of redlining, environmental racism, wealth gap, etc. ARE underlying health conditions. Inequality is a comorbidity. COVID relief should be drafted with a lens of reparations.”

As usual, this lunatic provided no source data for her accusations, nor any definitions for her wholly fabricated terms and concepts.

Like “environmental racism.” What, exactly, does that mean? How can ‘the environment,’ as most of us understand it, be ‘racist’ or bigoted? Moreover, how does money help alleviate this alleged condition?

But of course, AOC has her sycophantic supporters, and many of them specialize in also making issues of out non-issues by pointing out things that may or may not have anything to do with anything at all.

Yet…they notice such things.

I've also noticed that stores that mostly serve white customers are enforcing social distancing more than those in some black and brown communities. I have no idea why, it was just something I noticed while driving past grocery stores in different areas. — Alexandra MacArthur (@alexgoesthere) April 3, 2020

Great. Now there’s a racist conspiracy among white business owners who ‘enforce social distancing rules’ (as they are being requested to do by the president, his health policy advisers, governors, and mayors)? Who thinks like this?

The political equivalent of a cesspool

Oh, yeah. AOC supporters. Because she thinks like that.

No, wait. It’s white supremacy.

Their bodies also WORK DIFFERENTLY, and we blatantly IGNORE THIS in medicine and don't study the differences and then adjust treatment for. White supremacy pervades EVERYTHING. — Mainely Liberal (@MainelyLiberal) April 3, 2020

Stupidity.

USA Features Media notes further that AOC just isn’t a happy camper these days, even with members of her own party whom she feels are not sufficiently giving away the country’s future economic viability (as if coronavirus hasn’t been destructive enough):

Also, she’s used the outbreak as a platform to push her socialist agenda of universal healthcare, taxpayer-funded free college, instituting what she calls a “living wage,” and guaranteed housing.

On Tuesday, she blasted Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo for suspending mortgage payments but not rent payments during the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, he halted evictions for 90 days, though renters will still be responsible for missed payments, he said, because landlords have bills and payments too.

“We’re kind of creating a class and race issue,” Ocasio-Cortez said on WNYC’s “The Brian Lehrer Show,” Fox News reported Wednesday. “We’re essentially rewarding and offering preferential treatment to landowners and folks who are more wealthy, and we’re not offering that same kind of relief to renters.”

“There’s absolutely … racial and class inequities baked into the crisis,” she said. “If you are able to stay home. You are a privileged person in this moment.”

No, there aren’t.

This nonsense is a figment of a young socialist mind that has been polluted with the political equivalent of a cesspool. Nothing America does, tries to do, has done, or will do will ever suffice or be enough or be worthy of praise by AOC and her ilk.

America sucks, in other words, because it’s always going to be unjust, racist, bigoted, unforgiving and lousy — even when it has been attacked by a Chinese virus.

With these kinds of ‘friends,’ America has no further need of enemies.

This kind of nonsense isn’t helpful. At a time when a lot of Americans are smarting financially — and a lot more will begin to, soon enough — we need leaders who are uniting, not dividing.

Obviously, when it comes to this one, that’s asking too much.

Infected patients develop long-term immunity to coronavirus,"(Natural News) People infected by the coronavirus develop long-term immunity to COVID-19. A new study published August 14 in the journal Cell presented evidence that the immune system is capable of preventing the recurrence of the disease, thanks to specialized immune cells that commit the virus into memory.

Memory T cells are a type of white blood cell trained to recognize specific antigens — molecules unique to a particular virus or bacteria that evoke an immune response. The main function of memory T cells is to protect the body from a previously encountered pathogen, and they do so by triggering a faster and stronger immune response the next time they encounter the same pathogen.

According to a team of researchers from Sweden, Denmark and the U.K., people who have been exposed to the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) develop adaptive immunity to it, regardless of whether their symptoms were mild or severe. Even COVID-19 survivors and patients who tested negative for coronavirus-specific antibodies have this type of immunity, thanks to their body’s resident memory T cells.

The team’s findings of robust memory T cell responses in a mixed pool of COVID-19 patients and survivors in Sweden back these claims.

“SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune protection against COVID-19,” they wrote in their study. (Related: 5 Effective ways to boost immunity during the coronavirus outbreak.)

Virus-specific T cells or antibodies – which one is better?

Antibodies are well-known for their role in immunity. These Y-shaped proteins are produced by white blood cells called B cells to neutralize toxins and block pathogens from infecting cells. Antibodies recognize antigens and bind to them. While they don’t kill viruses or bacteria on their own, antibodies initiate responses that lead to the destruction or removal of pathogens from the body by specialized immune cells.

Owing to their ability to neutralize viral infectivity, scientists have explored the possibility of using SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies produced by COVID-19 survivors to develop a treatment for the disease. The threat of a possible second infection by the coronavirus also forced them to look at whether patients developed long-term immunity with the help of specific antibodies.

Unfortunately, recent investigations all revealed one thing: Coronavirus-specific antibodies don’t stick around for long. They usually disappear two to three months after recovery. According to some experts, these findings highlight the need for strong vaccines, since the immune system cannot provide immunity that lasts long enough to allow people to achieve herd immunity.

But in a new study, European researchers showed why they disagree and reminded people that antibodies are not the only components of the immune system capable of providing pathogen-specific protection. Memory T cells, which can remember previously encountered pathogens, can easily detect SARS-CoV-2 through its signature antigen and initiate a strong immune response in case of a reinfection.

After examining blood samples from patients with mild or severe COVID-19, patients who have recovered from either, and healthy volunteers, the researchers reported that exposure to the coronavirus elicits robust T cell responses. In patients with mild or severe COVID-19, they found that cytotoxic T cells, which are primed to destroy infected cells, were highly activated, while in recovered patients, the less destructive memory T cells were present.

Interestingly, the researchers detected SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in the blood of both current and recovered patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Altogether these findings show that infected people develop adaptive immunity to the virus. Their robust, highly functional memory T cell responses also suggest that they have active virus-specific protection against a possible second infection. And because memory T cells stick around for years, this protection can be expected to last for a long time.

Built-in immunity even without exposure

Two separate studies published in Nature in July also discussed T cell immunity in patients with COVID-19. Two research teams detected functional T cells that reacted to coronavirus proteins in their respective sets of patients. Both teams reported the same interesting finding: They detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells even in uninfected individuals.

In the first study — published two weeks earlier than the second study — researchers found that the T cells in uninfected participants behaved slightly differently from those found in recovering patients. While both sets recognized the coronavirus, the former targeted different regions of the viral protein than the latter. The second study also reported a similar pattern.

According to both teams, this unusual finding can be attributed to cross-reactivity. This phenomenon refers to when T cell receptor proteins recognize more than one antigen. Cross-reactivity in the human immune system has been documented by previous studies, but scientists are still unsure why it happens.

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, they believe that the T cells they found in uninfected individuals were originally activated because of previous exposure to other coronaviruses. And thanks to cross-reactivity, these T cells recognized fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 protein. In the first of the two studies to be published, the researchers noted that the protein regions recognized by T cells in uninfected individuals can also be found in animal betacoronaviruses.

If this hypothesis involving cross-reactivity is confirmed, then this strange phenomenon may help explain why there are mild and severe cases of COVID-19.

White House: 100 million coronavirus vaccines could be ready in October,"(Natural News) As many as 100 million coronavirus vaccines could be ready for distribution as early as October, according to the White House. Speaking to reporters on Sept. 17, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said that the initial tranche of 100 million vaccines would be sent to individuals with the highest risk of contracting the virus. He added that the second tranche of about 200 million could be ready by January next year.

Meadows’ statement follows remarks by both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, both of whom have said that the administration is on track to have 100 million coronavirus vaccines before the year ends.

Scientists are racing to test vaccine candidates, with a number of them currently in phase III — the last testing phase required before approval and distribution. A number of vaccines are already being manufactured through the administration’s Operation Warp Speed program, in case the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves them.

The Trump administration also released a strategy and playbook for distributing the FDA-approved vaccine to all Americans. According to the playbook, the vaccination campaign is to commence gradually in January 2021 or earlier than that period.

Meanwhile, Director Robert Redfield of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasized the necessity of a vaccine during a U.S. Senate hearing. When asked about the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine, Redfield gave an estimate of “[about] late second quarter [or] third quarter [of] 2021.” (Related: COVID-19 vaccine may not be generally available “until next summer”: CDC chief.)

Commenting on Redfield’s answer during the hearing, Meadows said that the CDC director “hasn’t had intimate discussions” on the vaccine production timeline as his office isn’t directly involved with vaccine development.

Democrats accuse Trump of fast-tracking the vaccine

Meanwhile, Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden said that a vaccine “will not be available for most of the population until well into 2021” during a speech. Biden added that the development cycle for vaccines don’t adhere to election cycles and reiterated that their timing, approval and distribution “should never … be distorted by political considerations.”

President Trump announced Operation Warp Speed in May to fast-track the development of a COVID-19 vaccine by early next year. Based on a fact sheet by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Operation Warp Speed brings different federal departments together to produce and deliver 300 million doses of “safe and effective” vaccines – at a fraction of the duration it typically takes to develop a new vaccine.

However, rushing to finish a vaccine comes with corresponding health risks.

In early September, pharmaceutical company Astra Zeneca hit a roadblock in its trials for the coronavirus vaccine after a test subject experienced a “serious adverse reaction.” Almost a fortnight later, another test subject experienced the same reaction from AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine.

The company has remarked that transverse myelitis, an inflammation of the spine, is a “rare” disease and had nothing to do with the coronavirus vaccine trials. AstraZeneca is one of the companies participating in Operation Warp Speed, and it would be too soon to say whether its coronavirus vaccine would see widespread use after these adverse effects emerged.

The U.S. has the highest worldwide COVID-19 caseload at 6.8 million with 200,814 fatalities, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.

How the left is using the coronavirus to make the world a twisted dystopia,"(Natural News) If you were living in a dystopia, how would you even know it?

(Article republished from LifeSiteNews.com)

The current situation certainly raises the question, as we experience unprecedented restrictions on individual freedom adopted in response to the Chinese coronavirus, coupled with left-wing riots that undermine the legitimacy of America’s core institutions. It’s becoming clear that these social changes are dystopian, not merely because they are harmful and coercive, but because they seek to replace the American way of life with a new social order rooted in utopian visions.

In a January 2019 essay on the overuse of the word “dystopia” in American political discourse, Miami University of Ohio professor Ryan J. Barilleaux wrote that the defining features of an actual dystopia are “social regimentation, dehumanization, abuse of technology, state terror, a new class of rulers, propaganda instead of truth, inevitable totalitarianism, and the tragedy of the individual.”

“When combined, these features sketch the map of dystopia,” wrote Barilleaux.

“Dystopia is what results from the attempt to create utopia,” he explained. “Consider the society of Brave New World, which is horrible precisely to the extent that the World State was designed to be exactly as it is.”

This year’s warp-speed cultural transformation has brought about all of Barilleaux’s hallmarks of a dystopia. The utopia today’s bureaucrats and elitists are striving toward is a global, communistic police state. This police state is sold to ordinary people not as that, but as a safe, virus-free society. Who wouldn’t want that?

Its architects admit that they won’t stop at a vaccine. “We will not, we cannot go back to the way things were,” World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said August 21.

Nonsensical “virus prevention” measures — forcing people to wear masks alone outside, curfews suggesting that the virus is more deadly at night than during the day — are priming the public to submit to increasingly arbitrary forms of government control and surveillance.

Social regimentation

The social regimentation of our new COVID world is ritualistic and religious. Hand-washing, staying physically away from others, walking only in certain directions at the grocery store, and not socializing are sacrosanct practices.

Snitch lines, bizarre rules about which doors students can use, all-online classes but no cancelation of room and board fees, “testing pods,” and COVID “symptom-tracker” apps are all part of the American college experience now.

So are “social distancing” rules limiting human contact, dorm visits, and parties. Will this mean the death of hook-up culture? Will “virtual” sex and more pornography simply fill its gap? Or will sexual license trump Wuhan virus prevention measures, just as Antifa and BLM riots have been exempt from the supposedly anti-coronavirus standards now applied to churches?

Dehumanization and the tragedy of the individual

Face masks, now required in public or to enter businesses in many places, are one of the most obvious mechanisms of dehumanization. Other people are now faceless potential virus-carriers to be avoided at all costs.

Enforcing limited or no social gatherings also dehumanizes the population. Humans are social creatures. Can existence be joyful, meaningful, and fulfilling if human contact is as severely limited as it has been ordered to be?

The crushing discouragement of family life is not only dehumanizing, but also one of the coronavirus power-grab’s greatest contributions to the tragedy of the individual.

As Barilleaux explained:

The ultimate result of dystopia can be seen in the tragedy of an individual. In dystopian stories and novels, the [protagonist] (such as John the Savage or Winston Smith) is crushed — or nearly so — as a way to make clear just how brutal the prevailing order is. In the real dystopias of modernity, individuals come to symbolize the oppression of the regime: the survivors of Hitler’s death camps, figures such as Andrei Sakharov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, or Otto Warmbier, the American student who died from mistreatment while in North Korean custody.

Today’s suffering individual is best exemplified by Shelley Luther, the Texas beauty salon–owner arrested and jailed for opening her business. A judge said she could avoid jail time by apologizing for being “selfish” and paying a fine, but she refused to “bend the knee,” as her lawyer put it.

For every fighting Shelley Luther, how many Americans are there who simply gave up their dreams of running a small business because the coronavirus and its accompanying restrictions robbed them of all ambition and hope?

Abuse of technology and state terror

Big tech and liberal establishment media censor any news that counters the narrative that the coronavirus — which the vast, vast majority of healthy people survive — is the most serious disease of the century.

A press conference by the pro-hydroxychloroquine America’s Frontline Doctors group was infamously scrubbed from social media despite its massive support, even from President Trump.

At the beginning of the lockdown, authorities in the United Kingdom used drones to capture footage of and subsequently shame people who were exercising. A “social distancing” robot dog — which looked eerily like a machine from Black Mirror — prowled a Singapore park telling people to stay apart.

In Kentucky, supposedly virus-positive individuals have even been fitted with electronic ankle monitors.

Unmasked Utah kindergarteners now face misdemeanor charges.

Police in Victoria, Australia have been granted authority to enter homes without a warrant to carry out “spot checks.”

The combination of 21st-century technology and petty, power-hungry bureaucrats (as my grandmother astutely put it, “some people like to exercise what little authority they have”) has created a perfect storm. And terror isn’t coming only from the state: tech companies voluntarily pick up the slack for government incompetence.

A new class of rulers

“[D]ystopia empowers a new class of rulers and uses propaganda and state terror to maintain the power of the regime,” wrote Barilleaux. “Dystopian regimes employ propaganda (‘Freedom is Slavery,’ ‘Community, Identity, Stability,’ ‘Workers of the world, unite!’) to mislead the populace and state terror (disappearances, reeducation camps, gulags, the Thought Police, the Firemen of Fahrenheit 451) to enforce conformity.”

Our new class of rulers are “public health experts.” Many of these people say there are an infinite number of genders, men can get pregnant, a human in the womb with a beating heart is just a “clump of cells,” and children should be able to attempt to “change” their sex.

They are now the ones whose interpretations of data and projections (projections being guesses) are infallible. Questioning them is to deny science, a cardinal sin.

Propaganda instead of truth

The coronavirus outbreak has produced a host of creepy “war is peace” phrases such as “staying apart keeps us together” and “social distancing.”

Actually, staying apart…keeps us apart. Staying as far as possible from other people isn’t social…it’s anti-social.

This has never been about a virus

For today’s revolutionaries, this was never about any virus; rather, it is about a crisis that can be used to usher in a new world order, a “new normal,” where human beings live in fear and under constant surveillance by an all-powerful regime.

In this atomized, isolated state, the populace is easier to control, and the supposedly “virus-free” utopia can be brought about.

However, nothing in history is inevitable. Dystopias are created only by and through the consent of those who stand by and say nothing while their liberties are taken. Americans mustn’t give tyrants a single inch. The time to fight is now, before it’s too late.

"Green tea, zinc, and hydroxychloroquine: Coronavirus cure?","(Natural News) The alt-media is all over the coronavirus – hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) scandal, with some news outlets even bravely talking about the importance of supplementing with zinc for maximum immune protection. But there is another healing component that few are mentioning, and it is probably already stocked away in your kitchen pantry.

We are talking about green tea, or more specifically epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol component of green tea that research suggests might be substantially more powerful than HCQ and zinc at protecting against viral infections.

Ionic zinc, as a quick background, helps to modulate both the innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways inside the body to ward off pathogenic invaders, including the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). And HCQ is said to help zinc ions more easily and effectively do their job in supporting healthy immune function.

There has been a whole lot of bickering recently over the alleged benefits of HCQ, with the anti-Trump left insisting that it does not work. Those on the right, primarily, say that HCQ works surprisingly well, and peer-reviewed science would seem to back this.

But the real power is in the zinc which, among its many other functions, acts as a protective nutrient for preserving natural tissue barriers, including in the respiratory epithelium. In essence, zinc helps to block pathogenic entry into the body while optimizing the immune system.

Zinc deficiency, in other words, is a major risk factor for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. We already know that about 16 percent of all deep respiratory infections worldwide are linked to zinc deficiency, and Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection is no exception.

“As a virus, SARS-CoV2 (Wuhan coronavirus) is highly dependent on the metabolism of the host cell,” one paper explains. “Direct antiviral effects of zinc have been demonstrated in various cases … Examples include coronaviridae [i.e. coronaviruses].”

“Zinc supplementation improves the mucociliary clearance, strengthens the integrity of the epithelium, decreases viral replication, preserves antiviral immunity, attenuates the risk of hyper-inflammation, supports anti-oxidative effects and thus reduces lung damage and minimizes secondary infections.”

Drinking green tea and taking zinc is BETTER than taking HCQ

Where HCQ comes into play has to do with its role as a zinc ionophore, meaning HCQ helps to deliver otherwise bio-unavailable zinc across the lipid boundaries of cells. Another drug known as clioquinol is said to be an even more potent zinc ionophore, delivering up to 10 times more zinc into the cells than HCQ.

As for green tea, its natural EGCG content is also a zinc ionophore. Not only that, it is a much more powerful zinc ionophore than HCQ which, it is important to keep in mind, is still a pharmaceutical drug.

While EGCG is only about 60 percent as powerful as clioquinol, it is substantially more powerful than HCQ which, due to political strife, remains largely inaccessible to Americans. Green tea, on the other hand, is widely available without a prescription.

“Fortunately, the main active ingredient in green tea, epigallocatechin gallate (“EGCG”) has been shown by a team of Spanish scientists to be 60% as powerful a zinc ionophore as clioquinol, which is the world’s most powerful zinc ionophore,” reports Zero Hedge.

“Dr. Juan Bautista Fernández Larre – a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology at the Universitat Rovira i Virgili – and his team have published several scientific papers on the topic.”

Another beneficial zinc ionophore in the natural category is quercetin (QCT), which is said to be about 30 percent as effective as clioquinol. This is still more effective than HCQ, though, providing yet another potential option for healing that avoids the political red tape and questionable safety of prescription drugs.

Getting vaccinated for coronavirus could make the pandemic worse,"(Natural News) Until a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine becomes publicly available, some government officials have indicated that they want to keep everything under indefinite lockdown. But a vaccine could end up making the plandemic even worse, according to Anthony Fauci.

In case you missed it, Fauci is on record as having stated in the past that earlier vaccine candidates for other coronaviruses produced a “suboptimal response.” He went on to explain that they actually “enhanced pathogenesis of the disease, which is always worrisome.”

The Citizens’ Council for Health Freedom (CCHF) in Minnesota has issued an urgent plea calling on government officials and health authorities to take note of Fauci’s words in addressing current vaccine policy.

“First, there’s ‘no guarantee’ a COVID-19 vaccine will work and second, it could ‘backfire,’ strengthening the virus,” the group has said, as reported by WND.

It was on May 12 that Fauci warned about “two major unknowns” concerning a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which for all intents and purposes is little more than a mutated cold virus.

“I think we should very carefully listen to Dr. Fauci’s concerns,” says Twila Brase, R.N., president and co-founder of CCHF. “No coronavirus vaccine has been developed despite earlier coronavirus pandemics.”

While it would normally take years for a newly developed vaccine to come to market, President Donald Trump has promised fast-tracked vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) as part of his “Operation Warp Speed” plandemic response.

“The American public should be concerned about the possibility that a COVID-19 vaccine may ‘backfire,'” Brase further warns.

2012 study found that SARS coronavirus vaccines made virus worse in test mice

A case-in-point was the infamous SARS pandemic of 2012. The global spread of this earlier iteration of coronavirus was used as an excuse to try to develop a corresponding vaccine, a project that utterly crashed and burned.

Test mice that were given the experimental jab appeared to develop some antibodies, but they also got sicker than the other mice that were not treated with the vaccine.

“Researchers discovered the mice, who were believed to have developed antibodies, had actually gotten sicker,” CCHF says. “The study concluded the vaccines had made the coronavirus more virulent, and issued ‘caution in proceeding to application of SARS-CoV vaccine in humans.'”

Despite all the vaccinated mice developing antibodies, injection with the vaccine resulted in the occurrence of what is known as Th2-type immunopathology, which suggests hypersensitivity to the components included in the SARS-CoV jab.

In lieu of favorable science, Yale wants to coerce people into getting coronavirus jabs by spreading “shame” and “guilt”

Since there is no evidence whatsoever that any Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine will be safe or effective, the plan, at least at Yale University is simply to “guilt” and “shame” resisters into getting jabbed.

A study conducted by Yale researchers concluded that the best way to enforce compliance is to call those who refuse the vaccine “not brave,” and to further suggest that they are selfish and do not “trust in science.”

In contrast to firefighters, doctors and front-line medical workers, all of whom are “brave,” according to Yale, vaccine resisters are cowards, this negative label representing a tool that the vaccine-pushers hope will compel more people to get vaccinated.

“Despite the danger of the vaccine backfiring, and before any of the vaccine trials have proven a vaccine to be safe and effective, proponents are busy figuring out how to force the public to get vaccinated,” Brase says about this desperate attempt to use character assassination as a tool to force vaccine compliance.

“Proponents want the unvaccinated banned from airplanes, buses, or trains, and want everyone to provide ‘evidence of immunization’ to enter public and private auditoriums and spaces. But Americans should be concerned about these proposals, this vaccine, and those who wish to ‘plunge it into their arm.’ People have no idea what they’re signing up for with this vaccine.”

Sweden Close To Victory Over Coronavirus; Never Had A Lockdown Or Mask Mandate,"As the rest of Europe and the world remains under the grip of draconian rules and the threat of new lockdowns, Sweden, which allowed its citizens to remain free throughout the entire pandemic, has pretty much declared victory over the coronavirus.

The country now has one of the lowest infection rates on the planet, and it’s difficult not to admire how it has handled the past year, with no strict lockdown or compulsory face mask rules. All businesses, schools and public places remained open in Sweden for the duration.

“Sweden has gone from being the country with the most infections in Europe to the safest one,” Sweden’s senior epidemiologist Dr. Anders Tegnell commented to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

“What we see now is that the sustainable policy might be slower in getting results, but it will get results eventually,” Tegnell clarified.

“And then we also hope that the result will be more stable,” he added.

Tegnell previously warned that encouraging people to wear face masks is “very dangerous” because it gives a false sense of security but does not effectively stem the spread of the virus.

“The findings that have been produced through face masks are astonishingly weak, even though so many people around the world wear them,” Tengell has urged.

Last week, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control confirmed Sweden’s drop in infection rate, with only 12 cases per million, compared to 18 in neighbouring Denmark and 14 in nearby Norway.



Graphic: The Sun

At the peak of the Sweden’s outbreak, it was seeing 108 new infections per million people, as it pursued a “herd immunity” strategy.

The figures also show that out of 2500 randomly selected and tested people in Sweden, none tested positive, compared to 0.9 percent positive in April, and 0.3 percent in May.

“We interpret this as meaning there is not currently a widespread infection among people who do not have symptoms,” said Karin Tegmark, deputy head of the Public Health Agency of Sweden.

When compared to the rest of Europe, Sweden’s death rate sits somewhere in the middle. However, officials are confident that playing the long game will see this improve drastically.

WHO Chief Warns Of “Vaccine Nationalism” As 172 Countries Sign Onto Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution Scheme,"World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned Monday that “vaccine nationalism” poses a threat to the globalist effort to administer coronavirus vaccines to the entire world.

“Vaccine nationalism only helps the virus. The success of the COVAX facility hinges not only on countries signing up to it, but also filling key funding gaps,” Ghebreyesus said, likely referring to President Trump and America, during the WHO’s latest coronavirus vaccine briefing.

So far, he said, 172 countries representing 70% of the world population have signed up for the coronavirus vaccine distribution scheme, where 2 billion doses of the vaccine will be distributed across the world by 2021.

“There is light at the end of the tunnel. As I said last week, together we can do it,” Ghebreyesus stated.

WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan also criticized President Trump’s recent effort to authorize emergency use of convalescent plasma treatment for coronavirus patients, saying there’s “very low evidence” that it would be effective.

“The results are not conclusive. The trials have been relatively small and the results in some cases point to some benefit but have not been conclusive. We have been tracking this and do ongoing… reviews to see where the evidence is shifting or pointing at and the moment it is still very low evidence,” she said.

But Swaminathan admitted earlier this year that the WHO doesn’t “really have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries, and this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions because we’re not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask about the deaths that have occurred due to a particular vaccine, and this always gets blown up in the media.”

However, Swaminathan was still quick to claim that the coronavirus vaccine, which is being fast-tracked by many years through safety trials by several countries and agencies, is the only safe bet.

“Generally, to develop a new vaccine for a disease, under normal circumstances, it will take anywhere between five to 10 years. In this case of a pandemic, with the joint efforts by WHO and other agencies, it might take at least one to one-and-a-half years, minimum, as finding a new vaccine involves a testing process,” she told reporters last week.

But don’t worry, this fast-tracked experimental vaccine will be much safer than well-known treatments that have been around for decades.

President Trump withdrew America from the UN-backed WHO in June over its poor response to the coronavirus pandemic and efforts cover up Communist China’s involvement in spreading the virus across the planet.

“China has total control over the World Health Organization despite only paying $40 million per year compared to what the United States has been paying, which is approximately $450 million a year,” the president said.

22 Colorado children die from coronavirus,"At least two youths in Colorado have died after developing a rare coronavirus-linked inflammatory condition known as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), health officials in the state said this week.

A total of seven children in the state have developed the syndrome, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) confirmed to Fox News on Friday. The cases have also been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

No other details on two deaths were revealed, including the children’s ages, with health officials citing privacy concerns.

“To protect family privacy, we cannot share any other details at this time,” CDPHE said in a statement to Fox News.

MIS-C is an inflammatory condition that is similar to Kawasaki disease, which causes swelling in arteries throughout the body. However, the two conditions are not the same, and MIS-C has largely been reported in children who have been infected with or exposed to COVID-19.

MIS-C typically causes inflammation in the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. MIS-C can also cause persistent fever, rashes, vomiting, and diarrhea, among other symptoms, such as a red tongue and eyes.

At least two children in Colorado have died after developing a rare coronavirus-linked inflammatory condition known as multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

At least two children in Colorado have died after developing a rare coronavirus-linked inflammatory condition known as multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

“We still think this is a relatively rare disease,” Dr. Sam Dominguez, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, told The Colorado Sun. “We still are in a learning phase about what this syndrome really is.”

A recent study found that MIS-C is indeed a new condition, with researchers in a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifying the main symptoms and clinical markers.

A recent study funded by the CDC also reaffirmed reports of MIS-C and its relation to COVID-19.

Researchers involved in the study surveilled pediatric health centers across the U.S. from March 15 to May 20. Of 186 MIS-C patients in 26 states, researchers found that 73 percent had been previously healthy, and 70 percent tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes a COVID-19 infection. The median age was 8.3 years, and patients were hospitalized for about a week.

Most patients had a fever lasting four or more days. For a small number of patients, 25 days had passed between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and hospitalization for MIS-C.

“These findings suggest that a substantial proportion of the patients in this series were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least 1 to 2 weeks before the onset of MIS-C,” the study’s authors wrote.",2020-07-24 22:09:40+00:00,,0
The Dark Side of Onlyfans They Don’t Tell You About [VIDEO],"You may have heard of OnlyFans, the membership app popular among Gen Z which allows fans to pay to see content from their favourite performers. Any influencer can use the app but it’s mainly utilised by people who work in porn. With many of us forced into self-isolation due to coronavirus, OnlyFans has become a lifeline for those working in the adult entertainment industry, with cam girls, adult models and porn creators all generating income by charging their ‘fans’ a fee to unlock their content.

OnlyFans has over 17.5 million users worldwide, and has seen 1.85 million new registrations since 29th February thanks to the pandemic, with performers reporting significant growth in their subscriptions in the last few weeks. While this may be good for the future of the British-based company, a new BBC Three documentary has zeroed in on the effects that selling explicit content can have on performers.



ViralCocaine takes a deep dive into OnlyFans and its part in the adult entertainment industry. We meet 23-year-old Lauren from Northamptonshire, one of OnlyFans’ top creators who brings home a whopping £37,000 a month selling explicit content. There’s also 24-year-old Beth, who earns £3,000 a month by selling naked content.

However, while Lauren and Beth’s incomes look impressive, presenter Ellie Flynn reports that for every ‘success’ story on the app, there are many more which are the opposite. Bespoke and exclusive research commissioned by the BBC for the documentary found that on a single day, a third of Twitter profiles globally advertising ‘nudes4sale’ (or similar) appeared to belong to an underage individual and many of those used OnlyFans to share their content.

Flynn meets Hannah*, a 17-year-old girl from Scotland who has been selling explicit content of herself since she was 16. Hannah initially set up an account on OnlyFans using a fake ID. Her account was then reported for being underage and was kicked off the site, but she managed to set up a new profile and continues selling nudes.

More young women are interviewed, like 20-year-old Sasha*, who earns a few hundred pounds each month on OnlyFans and uses that money to put a roof over her head. At age 15, Sasha sent explicit photos to boys on Snapchat, but things spiralled when one of her photos was leaked. “Unfortunately, my parents kicked me out and they are not ready to deal with how I lead my life.”

She’s still trying to find somewhere to live and is in desperate need of emergency accommodation from the council. But when she applied for it, her request was denied. “I’m not considered a priority and I can appeal it but that’s just going to take longer,” she says, holding back tears.



Using OnlyFans to make money is a financial lifeline for Sasha. In her content, she uses sex toys, collaborates with other performers and has even fielded requests to make videos of herself going to the toilet for £50-£60. “I do most things, I’m just not really into anything that involves extreme bodily fluids. I’ve spoken to customers about [filming toilet-based content] but I’ve never followed through,” she says.

I DO MOST THINGS, I’M JUST NOT REALLY INTO ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES EXTREME BODILY FLUIDS. A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL REQUEST VIDEOS OF YOU GOING TO THE TOILET. I’VE SPOKEN TO CUSTOMERS ABOUT IT BUT I’VE NEVER FOLLOWED THROUGH.

SASHA*

“It’s a very slow month. I’m making an extra £100-£200 a week, which obviously sounds a lot to some people but when you have to start spending that on finding somewhere to sleep and food and transport, you definitely need to get some content out and make some extra money.”



Moving her content from Snapchat to the fee-paying OnlyFans, Sasha admits that it could be very easy to fall into the trap of adult sex work. “It’s a rabbit hole. You can go further and further. Something that could’ve started as innocent fun can turn sour more quickly.”

As it stands, UK law states that you must be over the age of 18 to sell or distribute explicit content. However, there is no legal requirement or regulation to compel OnlyFans to scan content on its app for such material. All legal and potential criminal liability lies with the individual who uploads and/or receives/distributes said content.

Sasha says she receives messages from other underage girls wanting advice on how to create content like hers. But she warns the impact could be detrimental as they don’t see the whole picture. “I’m not going to put a photo of me wearing pyjamas without makeup on OnlyFans as it’s not going to get me anything. So they are only seeing the ‘good’ things.”

Flynn tells Refinery29: “Sasha was young, alone and suffering from serious mental health issues – yet was still left homeless, and to me this suggests there is a greater need for councils to protect vulnerable members of society to prevent more young women ending up feeling desperate.”

She says she is concerned that with more and more young people out of work and struggling to make ends meet, more will turn to sites like OnlyFans out of desperation, instead of choice. “It is so important to remember that while some people will do extremely well on sites like [this], there is absolutely no guarantee of success – and it seems to me the personal cost of selling nudes can at times be high.”",2020-07-19 02:09:45+00:00,,0
WOMAN INFECTED WITH COVID-19 GIVES BIRTH TO TWINS AND NAMES THEM CORONA AND VIRUS,"A Mexican woman who has contracted the coronavirus has miraculously given birth to twins reports El Heraldo.

Annamaria José Raphael Gonzalez, 34, gave birth to twins while she was infected with the coronavirus at Hospital General La Villa in Mexico City.

Gonzalez gave birth to two healthy babies at approximately 2 am this morning, a girl named Corona José Miguel Gonzalez and a boy named Virus José Miguel Gonzalez.

“I didn’t have any names planned and one doctor suggested I called them Corona and Virus because I was infected with COVID-19 and I thought it was a wonderful idea,” Gonzalez told reporters.

“I told her she should call them Corona and Virus as a joke but it seems she took it seriously,” Doctor Eduardo Castillas said laughingly.

Annamaria Gonzalez had planned to give birth in the United States next week but was forced into labor before she could reach the border.

“I knew I was infected with COVID-19 but I wanted to give my children a chance to have a U.S. citizenship by crossing the border,” she told reporters.

Mysterious new coronavirus outbreak hits China – MILLIONS back in lockdown MUTATING-symptoms don’t show for DAYS more,"Chinese officials have imposed quarantine restrictions on two cities in the province of Jilin located in northeast China. Jilin is part of a wider province located in the Dongbei region – which is home to more than 100 million residents. The threat level in the area has been raised to “high-risk” by health authorities.

Health officials have identified two emergency hospitals to treat the suspected spike in COVID-19 infections.

Around 40,000 residents in the cities of Jilin and Shulan have been tested for coronavirus after officials were alerted to a possible new outbreak. In Jilin, authorities stopped all major transport links to and from neighbouring cities until further notice.

Fresh COVID-19 cases in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang in the north-east of the country are displaying different symptoms, suggesting the disease is changing as it moves across the country once more. Dr Qiu Haibo, who is an expert in critical care medicine at the National Health Commission, said the cluster of cases in the cities – which have a combined population of five million – were proving a cause for concern.

People in the two cities were carrying the virus for longer before becoming symptomatic than cases among the population of Wuhan, to the south, where the disease was first identified towards the end of last year.

Dr Qiu told state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV): “This causes a problem, as they don’t have any symptoms.

“So when they gather with their families they don’t care about this issue and we see family cluster infections.”

In addition, he warned infected patients were taking considerably longer to recover.

In contrast to previous cases, new patients rarely displayed high temperature, and suffered lung damage rather than across, Dr Qiu said.

Intriguingly, he suggested the mutated strain seemed to have been imported from overseas.

He did not specify which country he was referring to – but both cities are close to China’s border with Russia, which now has the second-highest number of cases in the world, 317,554, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center.

They are also close to China’s border with North Korea – although, officially at least, the Hermit State has no cases of COVID-19.

Both Jilin and Shulan, located in the province Jilin, are subject to fresh lockdown restrictions.",2020-05-26 15:40:14+00:00,,0
More virus outbreaks including “EBOLA” erupt alongside coronavirus worldwide,"It’s a good time to be a virus, it seems. While everyone is likely well aware of the coronavirus pandemic, other viral diseases are also thriving, spreading locally and threatening already overwhelmed healthcare systems.

In Indonesia, dengue—which is spread through mosquitoes—has infected some 40,000 people so far this year, a nearly 16% rise from last year. Compounding the problem, most of Indonesia’s hospitals are now tasked with prioritizing patients with Covid-19, leaving those suffering from the painful and sometimes fatal symptoms of dengue without treatment.

In Latin America it’s even worse. The region saw the highest number of dengue cases in recorded history in 2019. And 2020 is on track to be bad too. Argentina right now has more reported cases of dengue than coronavirus. And experts worry that Brazil is about to become the next epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic just as its own dengue outbreak peaks.



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting large dengue outbreaks in Singapore, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is scrambling to contain a new flare-up of an Ebola outbreak that began in 2018. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a new series of cases there in April. As of May 5, there have been more than 3,500 confirmed or probable cases of Ebola in the region.

Health workers are also racing to vaccinate against yellow fever in Ethiopia, where an outbreak killed four people at the end of April. Both Mexico and Burundi are facing large outbreaks of measles and Saudi Arabia continues to battle an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, commonly known as MERS.

Viral outbreaks are hitting animals around the world, too. India and South Africa are both fighting outbreaks of African Swine Fever, which is highly contagious. In 2018, the virus shot through Asia, killing some 10% of the total pig population in some countries.

In the US, officials confirmed in April that a fatal strain of avian influenza had infected a commercial turkey flock in South Carolina. If it spreads, the disease could be devastating for a poultry industry already struggling with the economic impacts of Covid-19. In 2014 and 2015, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys across 15 states were killed to stop the spread of the virus, and much of the world banned American chicken and turkey products to avoid transmission.",2020-05-11 02:41:55+00:00,,0
All of These States Listed Are Headed for a “Full Shutdown”,"It was only a short time ago that the entire country was under some form of lockdown to help stop the spread of COVID-19. But as states across the U.S. began reopening—some much earlier and faster than others—new epicenters of the pandemic have emerged, with hotspots spanning east to west. To show where COVID risk level is the highest, researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute (HGHI) created an interactive map. The map gives each state one of four color distinctions to indicate their risk—green (on track for containment), yellow (community spread), orange (accelerated spread), and red (tipping point). According to the HGHI, “once a community reaches the red risk level, stay-at-home orders become necessary again.”

On July 11, Ashish Jha, MD, the director of the HGHI, tweeted that the “data on COVID in our nation is very concerning,” as the red states on the HGHI map posted troubling numbers. Jha stated that he wasn’t sure what would “turn it around” besides a “fully enforced mask order” and the closing of bars, clubs, restaurants, and all but essential retail. According to their numbers, these are the seven states that Jha says are “heading towards full shutdown.” And for more places in danger of sliding into critical territory.



1. Arizona

Arizona has not had a good run in the news lately. According to the HGHI data, the state is seeing nearly 48 new cases per day per 100,000 people. The state is also facing a supremely high positive test rate at about 26 percent, which indicates not enough testing is being down, and a critical shortage of ICU beds, according to Covid Act Now. The dire situation has led Arizona hospitals to institute “crisis standards of care,” which forces doctors to triage patients and decide who will receive full care based on their likelihood of survival.

While Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey did order gyms, bars, movie theaters, and water parks to shutter again for at least 30 days on June 29, Arizona’s numbers are still surging and further lockdown may be necessary. And for more on states that are suffering, check out The 2 States Where Coronavirus Is Spreading Fastest Will Surprise You.

2. Florida

Unfortunately, the news coming out of the Sunshine State has been anything but sunny lately. Besides showing 46 new cases per day per 100,000 people, according to the HGHI data, Florida saw the highest ever single-day of coronavirus cases for any state on July 12. Florida’s 15,299 new positive cases that day surpassed New York’s previous record set in April. Coincidentally, the news came the same weekend Disney World reopened to guests.

A couple of weeks prior, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered bars to stop serving alcohol on site. And while the mayor of Miami-Dade County has rolled back reopening, a further statewide shutdown could be coming.

3. Louisiana

Louisiana is one of the states that saw an early victory against the spread of the virus erased after reopening. The state is seeing about 40 new cases per day per 100,000 people, according to the HGHI data. Covid Act Now scores their infection rate of 1.26 as “high,” and the state saw their new cases double in just a week recently.

Now, a return to lockdown might already be in motion: On July 13, a statewide mandate closing bars and requiring face masks went into effect. And for more states that now require masks, These 4 States Just Made Face Masks Mandatory.

4. South Carolina

Recently, South Carolina was given the grim designation of holding the third highest COVID-19 rate in the entire world when compared with other countries and states. HGHI reported a rate of about 33 new cases per day per 100,000 people in the state, along with a critically high risk of hospital overload and a low number of contact tracers, reports Covid Act Now. Overall, South Carolina has seen over 60,000 total cases and nearly 1,000 deaths, The New York Times reports. Its cases have gone up a staggering 999 percent since reopening.

5. Texas

The Lone Star State may be one of the few places arresting people who refuse to self isolate after testing positive for COVID-19, but Texas’ coronavirus figures right now are still alarming. There are about 31 new cases per day per 100,000 people in the state, according to the HGHI, with a critically high risk of hospital overload and a dangerously low number of contact tracers, according to Covid Act Now. Short of a state shutdown, officials in certain hard-hit counties recently began telling citizens to “shelter in place” again.

Gov. Greg Abbott shut bars back down and scaled back restaurant capacity to 50 percent on June 26 and when numbers still surged, he also issued a statewide mask mandate on July 2. “If we do not all join together and unite in this one cause for a short period of time of adopting masks … it will lead to the necessity of having to close Texas back down,” he recently said. And for more on Texas, check out This Is the “Only Way” to Avoid Another Lockdown, Texas Governor Warns.

6. Georgia

Georgia was one of the quickest states to reopen, but since dropping their stay-at-home orders on April 30, they’ve seen their coronavirus new case numbers pick up. HGHI reports that there are nearly 29 new cases per day per 100,000 people, with a high infection rate and positive test rate that is trending upwards, according to Covid Act Now. That might mean they’re headed for another state shutdown. And for more states on the verge, check out These 10 States’ Coronavirus Outbreaks Are Now “Critical,” Experts Say.



7. Alabama

Alabama has roughly 28 new cases per day per 100,000 people, according to the HGHI data. But a growing shortage of ICU beds, a high infection rate, and a low number of contact tracers has earned Alabama a “critical” ranking from Covid Act Now. Local health officials recently warned that the northern part of the state in particular was on the verge of “going off the cliff” due to surging numbers.

2nd Ebola Virus Outbreak Confirmed in DCR & Makes Covid-19 Look like a Joke,"A second outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has struck Congo, even before an earlier outbreak in a volatile eastern region has formally ended.

The Congolese health ministry said Monday it had identified six cases of the Ebola virus in Equateur Province, a region along the Congo River on the border with the Republic of the Congo. Four people have died.

The Equateur Province was the site of a relatively small Ebola outbreak in 2018, which infected 53 people and killed 29. That outbreak was brought under control when health officials rapidly deployed a vaccine to several towns and villages, including Mbandaka, a trading port on the Congo River.

The new outbreak appears unrelated to another that erupted in North Kivu Province, along Congo’s eastern border with Uganda and Rwanda, in 2018. That incident became the second-worst Ebola outbreak in modern history, fueled by violence and unrest in a war-torn region where about a million people are displaced.

The World Health Organization said the health ministry had identified 3,406 cases, and 2,243 had died.

Keith Ellison responds to son’s antifa tweet: ‘A comment about the…

Days before the health ministry was set to declare the end of the North Kivu outbreak, several new cases were detected in the region. No new cases have appeared for several weeks, and the last patient stricken with the virus has been discharged from the hospital.

The new outbreak adds to an already perilous moment for Congo. The health ministry is already dealing with the world’s largest measles outbreak, and the ministry said Monday it had identified 3,195 confirmed coronavirus cases. Most of the coronavirus cases, 2,896, have hit Kinshasa, one of Africa’s most populous cities.

The Ebola virus now poses another challenge to health ministry officials, who will race to contain it before anyone infected can board a boat or ferry on the river.

Onlyfans Boyfriend Makes $9Million from 6 Girlfriends Since Pandemic Started,"“I’m Making More Money then the President, I’m thinking about giving the government a loan since I’m making money faster than they can print it” — Choosy

Since the coronavirus pandemic began close to 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment and are struggling to survive. One man Jay Mendoza aka Choosy the P is living the life most men can only dream about. He’s made over $9 million in only 8 short weeks since the pandemic started with 6 girlfriends on Onlyfans.

“I haven’t left the house in 2 months all I do is get my d*ck sucked, F*ck and order DoorDash, while I record my bitches eat each other out”

Said a jovial enthusiastic Choosy the P when we asked him what his day entails. He started with one Instagram model and she brought a friend and before he knew it he was 9 deep with no sleep.



“You can’t write new a chapter in your life with empty thoughts and a dull pencil” — Choosy

Many woman have signed up on onlyfans but only a small percentage actually make any significant amount of money. We asked Choosy what was his secret and he told us:

We were a little confused so we asked him to elaborate and he simply told us “if they knew better they would do better”.",2020-05-27 03:10:39+00:00,,0

Onlyfans Biggest Competitor Onlypunks Created By Thugger is on the Rise,"Onlyfans has around 9 million registered users and over 100,000 content creators, who have received over $175 million since the company launched in 2016. Years after tube sites like Pornhub began streaming free videos, OnlyFans is helping to re-monetise adult content.

The platform has a big competitor called onlypunks.com that is doing record breaking numbers since its conception in January of 2020. The company already has 1 million registered users in only a few short months and has grown 300% since the coronavirus pandemic started.

It is exclusively for Gay & Lesbian content creators and they are raking in the big bucks in a major way. One content creator Gump “Twinker put it in my Stinker” Gonzalez spoke with us to tell us about how onlypunks changed his life:

“I was broke homeless and sucking d*ck on megapersonals for a whole year living in the motel 6, but within a month of me signing up with onlypunks I bought my first home, 3 cars and money in my bank account, I love my life and now men pay to see my boyfriend pound this @ss out and I no longer have to f*ck for weed and molly doing $70 specials I’m so grateful for onlypunks” — Twinker

The gays aren’t the only ones cashing on the onlypunks wave, we spoke to proud dyke content creator Kelly “Shim Let Me Put This Plastic In” Patterson:

“I was just giving away this 9inch plastic dildo to these hoes for free now I get paid and make thousands to do what they husbands and boyfriends can’t do, keep em cummin, onlypunks is a blessing now I walk around with the strap on just in case I have to create content on the go, the more content I make the more money I make it really changed my life” — Shim

The coronavirus crisis is way worse than anything you could have imagined the end is near!,"It’s deflating, but it would be derelict to ignore: The hope of anything approximating normal in the coming months — and probably well beyond — is gone.

Why it matters: It’s great and normal to cheer for a miracle cure or sudden coronavirus retreat. But the experts who study the virus closest seem unanimous in their verdict that our health, economic and social pain will persist for many months to come.

It’s time to recalibrate expectations based on this stark reality:

Bill Gates warned in a blog post this week: “[I]t is impossible to overstate the pain that people are feeling now and will continue to feel for years to come.”

in a blog post this week: “[I]t is impossible to overstate the pain that people are feeling now and will continue to feel for years to come.” Gates said full stadiums and big concerts, both of which will be signs of true normal, “probably will not make the cut for a long time.”

director of the Centers for Disease Control, told the WashPost he imagines a one-two punch this winter of “the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.” Every big business and school in America is privately planning for the possibility of working and learning at home this fall. Schools have no choice but to contemplate the risks of kids picking up the virus in school, and infecting parents and grandparents at home. CEOs are having the same conversations about the workplace.

The true U.S. unemployment rate is estimated at 20% to 45% — possibly exceeding the Great Depression peak of 25% in 1933.

S&P now says the jobs recovery will take until next year, and we likely won’t get back to pre-coronavirus levels for a couple of years.

We cheer the idea of restaurants reopening — but, according to Bill Gates and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, likely with half as many tables.

Ask yourself this: How many restaurants, which already operate on thin margins, can survive with half the business?

How many restaurants, which already operate on thin margins, can survive with half the business? “The whole business model, the whole point of a restaurant, is to get as many people as possible into the space on a given night,” Edouardo Jordan, owner JuneBaby and other restaurants in Seattle, told the N.Y. Times.

Airlines, if and when they return to the skies, may have to leave middle seats open.

Ask yourself this: Would you travel if the threat of the virus remains?

Would you travel if the threat of the virus remains? If so, ask yourself: Can these airlines, already flirting with bankruptcies, survive with 33% fewer seats to sell?

The big picture: One of the most sobering reads of the past week was a synthesis by the N.Y. Times’ Donald McNeil of his gloomy conversations with 20+ experts about the next year or two:

“[T]he scenario that Mr. Trump has been unrolling at his daily press briefings — that the lockdowns will end soon, that a protective pill is almost at hand, that football stadiums and restaurants will soon be full — is a fantasy, most experts said.”

"Coronavirus Lockdown Is Only the Beginning it Will Last 12 to 24 Months, World Will Never Be the Same","“It’s like a fire… You have to keep suppressing it,” one expert said.

Strips of red tape, six feet apart, line the sidewalk outside the walk-up window at Chocolati Cafe. Business is steady on this sunny Sunday, despite the tables and chairs stacked up inside. Three baristas scramble to keep up with orders from an array of customers that stretches out more than 30 feet.

Geordie Glass has just ordered his eight-ounce latte. He’s on his way to walk a lap of Green Lake across the street. “I do this almost every day now,” Glass, 45, told Viralcocaine. “I’m running out of things to do at home.”

At the lake, a steady stream of walkers, runners, skaters, and bikers share the three-mile path with gaggles of geese. Here, too, most people—if not the congregating geese—are adhering to the international trend toward social distancing.

A reminder is posted by the trail: “Stay 6 feet or at least arm’s length away from others.”

But what was a sort of Northwestern curiosity as recently as a few weeks ago may not only outlast the wishes of GDP-fixated politicians like Donald Trump, but also become a regular—that is, intermittent—fact of American life. Taken together, recent COVID-19 forecasts suggest Americans should be ready not just for a months-long shutdown, but also to potentially return to the practice again.

In other words, some epidemiologists and other scientists closely studying the pandemic increasingly seem to be veering toward a long-term, multilayered approach—including repeated periods of social distancing.

“It’s like a fire. If you don’t completely put it out, it will come back. You have to keep suppressing it,” Michael Osterholm, professor and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told The Daily Beast.

More than 250 million Americans have been ordered to “shelter in place” or stay at home in hopes of quelling COVID-19. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D)—whose initial order in America’s first state with a confirmed case of the disease was set to expire on April 8—said last week that the effort would be extended. He and local authorities have also introduced piecemeal measures: In addition to schools, dine-in restaurants, bars, and other nonessential businesses, closures now include many trailheads, playgrounds, even boat-launch sites.

New data suggest the social-distancing efforts have slightly slowed the rate of increase in new COVID-19 infections across the state—that there’s hope here. “We have to hammer this until we can be assured it will not spring back up,” Inslee said.

But just how hard and how long to hammer remains up for debate. A pair of reports released Monday by the Bellevue-based Institute for Disease Modeling found that social-distancing policies have curtailed the movement of people around King County, Washington, and significantly slowed the spread of COVID-19. Still, the models suggest “evidence of fluctuating adherence” leaves the county in a “precarious position,” according to its authors.

That data followed analyses released Thursday by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine. As of Tuesday, it forecast U.S. deaths to total more than 83,000 by July, even with social-distancing measures in place. “It’s working and it will work even better if we do much more of it,” Ali Mokdad, a scientist at IHME and contributor to the analyses, told The Daily Beast. “In many places, even in Seattle, people are not 100 percent adherent to staying at home. We have to stay vigilant at least through mid-May.”

Even that may not be enough. Still more research released last week by a Harvard team suggested a successful battle against COVID-19 was also unlikely to be waged in a single shot.

The authors of the paper, a preprint posted at medrxiv.org that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed, determined that one long period of stringent social distancing could potentially backfire in a greater resurgence of infections come fall and winter, unless other interventions are put in place. The finding was consistent with the course of the 1918 influenza pandemic, during which cities that had low peaks during the first wave of infections—thanks in large part to social-distancing measures—were at a greater risk of a higher second wave after those interventions were lifted.

Models detailed in the Harvard paper point to cycled periods of social distancing as a potentially better way to minimize the overall toll on the population, achieve greater “herd immunity,” and take pressure off already-strapped intensive-care units (ICUs).

The approach may also provide a welcome summer respite for Seattleites, New Yorkers, and other Americans who are going stir crazy—or facing economic hardship, large or small. “Any kind of reprieve would be welcome,” said Glass, who works as a physician assistant in radiology—now 30 hours a week due to reductions in elective surgeries in response to the pandemic. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs entirely, and millions more are expected to in the coming days.

Rather than fully releasing the brakes, according to the Harvard models, officials may eventually want to start pumping them—strategically letting up on social distancing as ICU beds empty, and then re-enacting measures as beds fill back up. The idea, in part, would be to steadily build up population immunity while not overwhelming critical-care capacity.

“What we find is that those social-distancing efforts that are relatively successful in flattening the curve end up pushing the peak out,” Yonatan Grad, an infectious-disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of the paper, told The Daily Beast. “If there is seasonality, and if the peak gets pushed into the fall, we will see an even higher peak.”",2020-04-25 21:29:14+00:00,,0
"Hantavirus, a New Threat? Man in China Tests Positive and Dies of Virus","While the world is still dealing with the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a man in China has just recently reportedly died of another virus, called Hantavirus. Along with the man, there were 32 other people on the bus he was on that tested positive for the virus as well, which is quite rare because the virus does not usually pass from human to human.

Hantavirus

The Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome or HPV has a 36% fatality rate that is an alarming number for an otherwise small virus.

What is Hantavirus?

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have defined this virus as belonging to the family of Hantavirus pathogens that spreads mainly through rodents. According to the CDC, “Infection with any hantavirus can produce hantavirus disease in people,”

The agency explains that every single strain of Hantavirus is linked with a specific rodent and that this virus is passed through airborne transmission when the particles that contain the virus from the animal’s feces, urine, or even saliva travel in the air and infect an individual.

The infection from this virus is quite similar to other viruses as a person could get this by touching their mouths or nose after being in contact with contaminated surfaces with urine, saliva, or feces from the host. Eating contaminated food could also be another way this virus travels.

The Hantavirus is more likely to be caught in rural areas such as forests, farms, or even fields where the rodent carriers are most likely to be found.

The ‘New World’ Hantavirus versus the ‘Old World’ Hantavirus

People within the Americas infected with the ‘New World’ Hantavirus can possibly develop what is more popularly known as the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome or HPV. The ‘Old World’ Hantavirus, on the other hand, can be found in either Asia or Europe, which can trigger Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome or otherwise known as HFRS.

The CDC has stated that the Hantavirus within the U.S. cannot pass from person to person, while only rare cases of human to human transition have been found in Chile and Argentina in people who had quite a close contact with those positive of the Andres virus.

The symptoms of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome or HPS include fever, fatigue, and muscle aches, especially in thighs, hips, the back, and also the shoulders. People who are infected may get headaches, chills, vomit, and even experience diarrhea and stomach pain.

After four to ten days, the person might then experience shortness of breath, cough, and certain fluids that may even fill their lungs.

The details of the man were withheld

Whether or not the man experienced certain HPV symptoms or HFRS symptoms is unclear, but the fact that the virus was able to transfer through human to human contact is quite alarming and is a rare case as reported by the CDC.

The name and other personal details of the victim are still being withheld.",2020-03-24 20:17:16+00:00,,0
President Trump Likely Has Coronavirus – Faces Hospitalization!,"There’s a new report from Slate magazine, that claims that President Donald Trump is “likely” to have contracted the coronavirus.

This is bad news for Trump, because ViralCocaine News has learned he’s at high risk for developing serious complications if he’s contracted the virus. Trump has a number of risk factors, which will all but guarantee that the virus will be devastating for the president.

First off, he’s obese. According to researchers in China, obese patients are at high risk for developing complications with the virus. Trump weighs more than 320 pounds and is 5’10. According to the CDC calculator, he is 50% body fat and considered “severely obese.”

Second, the president is 72 years old. Doctors say that the elderly – defined as those over 70 – are at a much higher risk of death or becoming seriously ill.

Third, he’s a man. The disease is a lot more severe in men than in women. Researchers don’t know why, but the epidemiological reports are clear – men face more complications than women.

Finally, the president has serious heart disease. The last publicly available cardio calcium report of Trump showed that he had extensive heart disease. So much so, that he now takes daily medication to keep it at bay.

So what are his chances of death or serious outcome for the President – VERY high. Some doctors on social media estimate that if the President did contract the disease there was a 50% chance or more of a serious complication that required hospitalization.

Here’s the Slate article discussing why they believe Trump has contracted the coronavirus.

Coronavirus Has 2 Strains Type S Strains Spread Disease Without Them Even Knowing Plus More on the Way,"The deadly coronavirus now confirmed to have two strains which would make it harder for medical experts to contain the spread and find the cure. The virus is evolving and experts say it’s a normal occurrence that viruses’ do when transferring from animal to humans.

70 percent of the infected have caught the more aggressive and communicable strain which quickly spreads to one host to another as the studies have shown.

Type L and Type S Strains

Type L strains that make up for 70 percent of the infected patients are the most lethal, aggressive and contagious types. If you have this strain you will be highly contagious to others and the symptoms will immediately show and medical assistance is required ASAP.

Type S strains that make up the remaining 30% of the infected patients are similar to a slow build-up. This means that it will take more time for the symptoms to show and will less likely be detected even by devices built to detect and deter the spread of the deadly virus.

Possible Reason as to the Rapid Spread of the Virus

Type L strains are becoming less prevalent now and seem to be waining off compared to its sister strain due to “human intervention”, it is safe to say that the human intervention is quickly isolating, treating and warding off the infected which deterred the spread of the coronavirus Type L strain.

If Type S infected to take a longer time to show symptoms but are still contagious than it is safe to say that they are the ones spreading the sickness without the health authorities knowing it as well due to the discreetness of the disease. Type S infected end up infecting more and more people until they too show signs of having the virus and thus transported to quarantine or hospitals for treatment.

The problem now is with the Type S infected, how many people have they came across and have had physical contact or indirect contact with before they were diagnosed. That question alone is disturbingly high enough for you to even take a guess.

Two Strains Confirmed, Possible More on The Way

As the research team only were able to study 103 samples, there are still any more combinations that can lead to more breakthroughs to help the fight of the sickness, worst is they will find out more strains of the virus since it is still evolving right now and shows no sign of stopping regardless of the full force of the medical professionals and the full weight of multinational governments resources.

The Study and The Lead Scientists Discoveries

The team led by Professor Jian Lu and Dr Jie Cui, said in their research paper: ‘Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020.

‘Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly.

‘On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure.’

Coronavirus: Symptoms & Natural Solutions,"The coronavirus is all over the news and social media. It seems like it’s one of the top things people are talking and feeling concerned about. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronaviruses that first started in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It causes fever, coughs, shortness of breath, and upper-respiratory symptoms. Though the majority of the cases are still in China, the virus is spreading around the world and we may be facing a pandemic soon.

But what is the coronavirus anyways? Is it really that dangerous to call for panic? What if the coronavirus starts spreading in the United States? What can you do to protect yourself from the coronavirus? So many good questions – I aim to address everything today.

In this article, you will learn what the coronavirus is, how it spreads, what are its symptoms, and who is at risk of the infection. You will learn about some major lifestyle factors that can cripple your immune system and put you at greater risk of any virus or respiratory infection. I will also share some natural solutions that can help to prevent viruses, respiratory infections, and illness this season and help you recover quickly if you do get sick.

What Is the Coronavirus Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large group of viruses. Different strains may cause different illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV, or SARS) or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV, or MERS). Coronaviruses tend to be zoonotic viruses, which means that they can be transmitted between people and animals. For example, SARS was transmitted from civet cats to humans, whereas the MERS originally spread from camels to humans. There are various strains of coronaviruses that are circulating between animals but have not infected humans so far. If you open the news and read about the coronavirus, they are referring to the novel coronavirus (nCoV) or Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new strain of coronaviruses that haven’t been previously seen in humans and has been spreading since late 2019. In this article, I will specifically be covering the COVID-19 and will simply to this strain as ‘coronavirus’ or ‘coronavirus infection’. The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak first started in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While we know that the infection spread from animals, it is not yet clear which animal it has come from. It is a strain of coronavirus that we have not encountered before and it’s different from other strains, including the previously seen SARS or MERS. Symptoms are similar to the flu and the common cold, however, may become severe and lead to complications in those with chronic health issues or in older people. The mortality rate is at 2 percent in Hubei providence in China where the outbreak started and less elsewhere. This is much better than SARS, which had an over 10 percent mortality rate or MERS which killed about 35 percent of those infected.

Coronavirus in the United States

While most cases are located in China, the virus is spreading, which over 300 new cases recently appearing in Northern-Italy. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern, however, not yet declared a pandemic, which is a term referring to an epidemic of disease that has spread worldwide.

Though the United States has only seen 14 confirmed cases, several cities, including San Francisco, declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus to allow hospitals, healthcare professionals, schools, and businesses to prepare. The aim is to help prevention, treatment, and for scientists to find effective vaccines or antiviral medications. However, personal responsibility is also critical, this is why I will go over some natural strategies to boost your immune health later in this article (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).",2020-03-05 04:35:58+00:00,,0
San Diego lab discovered a coronavirus vaccine in 3 hours but testing it will take months,"Researchers at a San Diego lab say it took them just three hours to come up with an experimental vaccine for the coronavirus — a potential weapon against the illness which has infected tens of thousands of people worldwide.

Inovio Pharmaceuticals is now scrambling to test the vaccine, first in animals and then in people, and if it succeeds they hope to get it to the public as soon as possible, CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB-TV reports.

Chinese scientists released the genetic sequence for the coronavirus on January 9, and researchers at Inovio and other labs around the world immediately got to work.

“We have an algorithm which we designed, and we put the DNA sequence into our algorithm and came up with the vaccine in that short amount of time,” Dr. Trevor Smith, Inovio’s director of research and development, told KFMB.

“It’s something we are trained to do, and the infrastructure is here and the expertise is in house,” Smith said. The company has also worked on vaccines for Zika virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola.

Scientists hope the vaccine will work like a piece of biological software, according to KFMB — giving the human body instructions to launch a targeted attack in the form of T-cells and antibodies against the virus.

“I think it’s every promising, and Inovio has very advanced technology that they’re using with making a DNA vaccine, which is different than our traditional vaccines,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told CBS News.

So far, KFMB reports Inovio’s coronavirus vaccine has been tested on mice and guinea pigs. A clinical trial in humans could come next, perhaps by early this summer — which the company describes as record time. The scientists say they feel a sense of urgency to get an effective vaccine to the public. But even if all the testing proves successful, it would still take time to meet federal regulatory requirements and gear up for manufacturing.

The lead researcher of the company is at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Sweden, working on a plan of attack against coronavirus.

"CORONAVIRUS OFFICIALLY AIRBORNE, EVACUATION STARTED IN HONG KONG","The deadly coronavirus virus that has plagued humanity has got even worse. Previously thought that you will need to have direct contact or contact transmission is now confirmed that it can be caught by just being near an individual who is infected. Tech giants are pulling out from the MWC 2020 that is worrying this year’s lineup.

The Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau deputy head stated over the weekend during the Saturday press briefing that “Aerosol transmission refers to the mixing of the virus with droplets in the air to form aerosols, which causes infection after inhalation, according to medical experts,”

“As such, we have called on the public to raise their awareness of the prevention and control of the disease caused by family gatherings.”

Direct transmission: breathing in the air close to an infected patient who sneezes or coughs, and

Contact transmission: when a person touches an object tainted with the virus before infecting themselves by touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.

Grim News for MWC

The Mobile World Congress(MWC) is the largest mobile tech show there is. Companies big and small use that even as a platform to showcase what they have in-store for potential customers as well as create a buzz in the tech world. Sadly, Amazon, LG, Ericson, Ericsson, and potentially more will not be attending this year’s event in Barcelona, Spain.

As more and more major investors pull out of the event, management has decided to put stringent rules and health safety measures to encourage people to come. Despite the efforts, it seems that MWC 2020, for now, will not be as grand as people who had hoped for. Regardless, it will still push through as there is no news or press release indicating otherwise.

nCov update around the world:

The death toll from the virus in the globe as of the time of this writing is 910. Officially making it more deadly than the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS that wreaked panic and massive outcry.

China’s National Health has already confirmed new cases of over 3000 and almost about 100 deaths already in their care. The infection rate has drastically scaled up, which is causing concerns, and governments are doing what they can to control the spread and prevent mass hysteria.

Total of infected people is about 40,000 already, and the cure is still not a viable option.

The main goal for the MWC 2020 right now is to keep as many investors as possible since it’s always been a staple of companies showing their innovations and compete with the best of the best on a world stage setting. The spread of the nCov virus that really can be fatal is going to be a hindrance, to say the least for people to go out and actually go to any events. Some governments around the world are starting to postpone public events due to this news of the virus being airborne.

He may pay her to help him achieve an orgasm, though she is not a prostitute. He may purchase erotic videos from her, though she is not a porn star.

Ms. Harwood is one of the top earners on OnlyFans, where subscribers — mostly male; straight, gay and beyond — pay models and social media influencers a fee, generally $5 to $20 a month, to view a feed of imagery too racy for Instagram. With that access, subscribers can also direct message and “tip” to get pictures or videos created on demand, according to their sexual tastes.

Models who join the site often presume that their subscribers will increase in number if they post more often and make the content more explicit. The “more often” part is true. The “more explicit” part is not.

At a time when anyone with a smartphone or small studio can become his or her own pornographer, and content is often free, the hottest site in the adult entertainment industry is dominated by providers who show fewer sex acts and charge increasing fees depending on how creative the requests get.

That’s the first paradox at the center of the OnlyFans phenomenon.

Jem Wolfie and Matthew Camp, Businesspeople

The most popular OnlyFans personality is Jem Wolfie, of Perth, Australia.

She can’t help but laugh when people call her a “fitness model.” As she noted in an interview, “70 percent of my fans are men.” So the bulk of them aren’t looking for exercise tips, although she may provide them, for an added fee (along with healthy recipes — she used to be a chef).

According to OnlyFans, she has 10,000 subscribers who pay $10 a month for access to a feed in which she shows off her Kardashianesque proportions, squatting in really tight leggings and squeezing her breasts together, strategically covering her nipples. “I’m a thick girl,” she said matter-of-factly.

It doesn’t go much further than that.

“Basically, OnlyFans is online go-go dancing,” said Matthew Camp, a 34-year-old model on the men’s side who broke into the business a decade ago writhing on platforms around downtown Manhattan for the party promoter Susanne Bartsch.

If the four main quadrants of the gay approval matrix were daddy, twink, bear and boy next door, he seemed to sit smack in the center, not falling neatly into any of those categories but appealing to the potential audiences for each.

With a G-string and a strobe light, he could make as much as $1,000 on a good night. Porn studios like Lucas Entertainment began calling.

Mr. Camp was intrigued. “Having sex for money is appealing,” he said. But $1,000 seemed low for something that would sit on the internet and brand him for life as a porn star.

So he turned them down and instead used a PG-13 feed on Instagram to build a following of more than half a million. About a year ago, as the club scene continued its slow death, he moved to Hudson, N.Y., and signed up for OnlyFans.

Weeks often went by without him posting a single picture or video. He didn’t show a full penetrative sex clip for the first nine months, yet he still regularly took home more than $10,000 a month.

“Tumblr was filled with the most extreme sexual experiences you could see,” he said. “And I think a lot of people were turned off by that. It’s not what they’re looking for. They want more intimate experiences. They want a boyfriend experience. They want to fantasize about someone that they want to have sex with and not feel disgusted by it.”

How the Internet Destabilized Pornography

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, dreamers in the porn industry, centered in the San Fernando Valley of California, openly described their multi-million-dollar futures in the business. There was actually a history of this happening, at least for a small number of models signed to lucrative long-term contracts with studios like Vivid and Wicked.

They could make north of $5,000 a scene and shoot a couple of those each week, according to Brian Gross, a well-known industry publicist. That income could be supplemented with five-figure sums doing nightclub appearances around the country on the weekends, he said.

Jenna Jameson — the Julia Roberts of straight porn — even parlayed her notoriety into a memoir released by HarperCollins, “How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale,” which was a New York Times best seller. The title turned out to be eerily prescient. As its publisher, Judith Regan, pointed out: “Porn went the way of all media.” It turns out, everyone could do it.

Except that because porn was an industry of people already living on the margins of society, the effects for the performers were in many ways worse.

The primary culprits were so-called tube sites: YouTube-like platforms that aggregated stolen pornographic content, disseminated it for free and sucked up revenue from banner and video ads.

Jem WolfieLauren Fleishman for The New York Times

Since porn studios did not have the capital or political connections to sue their most threatening adversaries out of business (as the record industry did), rates for scene work dropped. Fewer scenes were shot overall. Eventually, the studios began selling themselves to the tube sites at fire-sale prices.

It was as if the entire music business had been subsumed by Napster.

By 2015, a handful of companies were able to exert monopolistic control over the industry. MindGeek is the biggest player of all. The crown jewel of its empire is Pornhub (perhaps the most popular tube site in the world), which is supplied with content from numerous in-house production companies of the straight (Brazzers.com, Reality Kings) and gay varieties (SeanCody, Men.com).

MindGeek knows all about porn habits by doing comprehensive data analysis. It has shown less of an affinity for the product or the people who appear in it.

The MindGeek website makes no reference to the fact that the overwhelming majority of its customers are consumers of hard-core pornography.

The technocrats who built the company got rich. Many of the performers who helped enable their success became prostitutes, offering their services on websites like RentMen.com and The Erotic Review when scene work ceased to be a viable way to make a living.

It’s a fitting but unfortunate parable in an era of rampant economic inequality.

“If you have a known name, it’s much easier to market your services,” said Dirk Caber, a porn star who has filmed close to 40 scenes for MindGeek’s most popular gay site, Men.com, since 2013. Most of his income comes from his work as an escort, because this scene work pays so little.

“The whole industry did a 180,” Mr. Gross said. “When I started, there were actually websites that would out famous porn stars if they escorted, because it was shocking, for lack of a better word. Now, all talent is looked at as if they are escorts, and those who aren’t have to come out and say so.”

Your ‘Online Girlfriend’

One alternative to escorting is webcamming. In England, there are even TV stations, like Playboy and Babestation, on which models talk live with thousands of customers and earn several hundred dollars a day.

That’s what Ms. Harwood did before OnlyFans came along.

She grew up in Wales, with a mother who stocked supermarket shelves and a father who was a factory worker.

It was a “typical working-class” household, she said recently, while on a vacation in New York that included a trip to the 9/11 memorial and the taking of many hotel room selfies.

As a little girl, Ms. Harwood was a relentless attention seeker, the sort who appeared in school plays, competed in beauty pageants and studied dance. She also had reservoirs of empathy that would serve her well later in life.

She could spot pain in others and find ways to make them feel better. She also was capable of identifying her limitations and finding ways to chart new paths for herself. “I was raised well,” she said.

She studied dance at Laine Theatre Arts, a prestigious drama and dance college near London. Then, “I went to audition after audition,” she said. “Eventually, I realized I wasn’t good enough. And it was quite hard to accept at first.”

Around 2005, Ms. Harwood posed topless on Page 3 of The Daily Sport, a second-tier British newspaper that she said “was popular with day laborers and construction workers.”

This apparently included the guys her father worked with.

One morning, he went into work and saw the picture of his daughter plastered to his locker.

On her face, his colleagues had drawn his mustache and glasses. That’s how he found out she was modeling nude. That’s why he warned her about being disowned.

Ms. Harwood felt terrible. Although she likes taking off her clothes for other people, she seems driven less by the desire to transgress than the desire to please. If she were reincarnated as a Disney character, she’d be Jessica Rabbit, not Miss Piggy.

But it wasn’t like her father had the money to support her. His warning was sort of an empty threat. So she kept going, with appearances in Playboy and British so-called laddie magazines.",2020-04-11 17:51:19+00:00,,0
Lifesaving’ lupus drug in short supply after Trump claims it’s a possible coronavirus cure,"For nearly 30 years, Bonnie Lieberman has relied on a drug called Plaquenil to prevent a flare-up of symptoms associated with lupus: rashes, debilitating fatigue, “swollen, hot, painful joints.”

“This drug is lifesaving for me because it helps me function,” she said.

But when Lieberman, a preschool teacher from California, called her pharmacy Friday to check whether her new prescription was available, she got a startling reply.

“I physically don’t have any medication,” Lieberman, 46, said she was told. “It’s back-ordered everywhere.”

Lieberman didn’t have to be told why. She knew that President Donald Trump had touted the drug, known by its generic name, hydroxychloroquine, as a possible treatment for the coronavirus the day before.

Clinical tests are only just beginning, and infectious disease experts say it’s too soon to reach a conclusion. Still, the publicity surrounding hydroxychloroquine, which began well before Trump’s remarks, has fueled shortages across the country, NBC News found.

“To affect lupus patients this way is irresponsible and dangerous,” said Lieberman, a mother of two from Sunnyvale.

“I hope they find something that helps people,” she added, “but it’s more that it’s an unfounded thing at this point.”

Hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial medication, has long been used by people who suffer from lupus. The autoimmune disease afflicts about 1.5 million Americans, predominantly women and African Americans.",2020-03-24 01:42:11+00:00,,0
President bans sex for the next 6months to prevent coronavirus spread,"The Kenyan government has told members of the public to avoid unnecessary sex and have at least two beds in one household.

The government also discouraged any close contact of people with their partners saying that will increase the chance of spreading coronavirus.

Kenya has confirmed three more coronavirus cases, meaning the country now has seven patients with Covid 19.

Health Cabinet secretary Mutahi Kagwe on Wednesday confirmed that three more patients had tested positive for the virus.

Two of the cases were a couple that travelled from Madrid, Spain on March 4 through Dubai arriving in Kenya on March 5.

The tired case is a Burundian national who travelled from Dubai, UAE, to Kenya. He arrived on March 17 and was picked up by a surveillance team, Mr Kagwe said.

We are tracing persons who may have been in contact with the patients” he said.

The tested were done by the National Influenza Centre and the Kenya Medical Research Institute.

Eighteen patients are currently admitted at Mbagathi. Of these, the CS said seven have been screened and are negative. Samples of 11 others are still being processed.

The Kenya government is now appealing to Kenyans to report anyone who is not self-quarantining.

“Any Kenyans travelling into the country must sign a legal form to assure the gov’t that you will be self-quarantine,” he said.

Mr Kagwe also stressed the importance of strict hygiene in curbing the spread of the pandemic.

“Washing hands and social distancing is the key reasons Chinese cases are coming down.”",2020-03-21 22:06:07+00:00,,0
Rabbi: Coronavirus outbreak is divine punishment for gay pride parades,"Meir Mazuz claims Arab states spared, because they ‘don’t have this evil inclination’; modern Orthodox group blasts him for ‘inciting against the LGBT community’

An Orthodox Israeli rabbi has claimed the spread of the deadly coronavirus in Israel and around the world is divine retribution for gay pride parades.

The remarks by Rabbi Meir Mazuz, reported by the Israel Hayom daily on Sunday, drew condemnation from rights groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, which urged him to apologize.

An influential Sephardic rabbi, Mazuz is the former spiritual leader of the defunct ultra-nationalist and homophobic Yachad party, and is head of the Kiseh Rahamim yeshiva in Bnei Brak.

On Saturday night he gave a talk at the yeshiva, during which, according to the report, he said a pride parade is “a parade against nature, and when someone goes against nature, the one who created nature takes revenge on him.”

Mazuz said that countries all over the world are being called to account because of their gay pride events, “except for the Arab countries that don’t have this evil inclination.” That was why, he claimed — falsely suggesting there has only been one case of infection in the Arab world — they have not seen a spread of coronavirus.

The outbreak in Iran, one of the most serious in any country, he explained as being due to the wicked ways of Iranians and “their hatred of Israel.”

According to the newspaper, Mazuz had earlier claimed Israel would be protected from the coronavirus.

“It is regrettable that in times like these when the whole world comes together to eradicate coronavirus, Rabbi Mazuz finds it appropriate to blame the virus’s outbreak on the LGBTQ community. We harshly condemn his statements and urge him to apologize,” the ADL’s Israel branch said in a statement.

The modern Orthodox Ne’emanei Torah Va’Avodah group also condemned Mazuz’s remarks.

“Using this time of need to incite against the LGBT community is unacceptable. Trying to get people to return to religion cannot come at the price of harming others,” it said in a statement.

Israel has thus far had 39 cases of coronavirus, including 14 new cases announced on Sunday night, but no deaths.

Mazuz is no stranger to controversy or hateful rhetoric. In November 2015 he claimed gay pride parades and other forms of “sinful behavior” were the reason terrorists murdered Eitam and Naama Henkin on October 1, 2015.

At a memorial event for the Henkins, Mazuz said that their shooting death at the hands of Palestinian terrorists had been a form of divine retribution.

In 2016 Mazuz attributed the collapse of a Tel Aviv parking garage that killed six people and an explosion that destroyed the Amos-6 satellite to Shabbat desecration.

Israel has two major gay pride parades each year, one in Tel Aviv and another in the capital, Jerusalem, which is billed as promoting tolerance.",2020-03-20 04:35:16+00:00,,0
Barber Dies From Coronavirus After Continuing To Cut Hair During Pandemic,"Damn: Barber Dies from COVID-19 After Taking House Calls

Y’all, please stay home. A Mississippi barber has died from the coronavirus after his family says he continued to cut customers hair during the pandemic. Black people are dying at a disproportionate rate from COVID-19 in several states across the country, especially the south.



Eugene Thompson tested positive on March 22, and felt symptoms as early as March 17. However, it appeared that he was still accepting clients at his shop as well around that time, social media posts show. It also appears he was at a barber competition on March 15th.

Strippers in Atlanta are Testing Positive for the Coronavirus,"Atlanta, GA — Strippers across Atlanta are testing positive for coronavirus according to the CDC.

Patrons of strip clubs are encouraged to check themselves into a health clinic to get screened. The CDC reports that strip clubs are breeding grounds for coronavirus due to all of the flesh, sweat, booty grease and silicone running rampant in the clubs.

The CDC is recommending that strip clubs shut down business for a period of 2 weeks, install plexiglass windows to separate strippers from the patrons, or have stripper wear biohazard suits to minimize the transmission of the virus.",2020-03-16 19:13:33+00:00,,0
NYC Man Drops Dead In Middle Of Street – Suspected Coronavirus! [VIDEO],"An Asian man wearing a surgical mask passed out yesterday in the middle of a crowded street in Queens. The man was rushed to the hospital, where according to social media reports, he is believed to have died.

The man’s cause of death has not yet been determined, but plenty of people suspect that he may have died of the coronavirus.



The incident occurred in Flushing Queens, an area of the city filled with Chinese immigrants.According to reports, a man was walking down the street, when he was suddenly overcome with a bought of coughing. He collapsed onto the floor, and after a few seconds, he stopped moving.

As the video shows, officers quickly arrived on the scene, but seemed unwilling to physically assist the man, perhaps out of fear.

Coronavirus lockdown could last 10-12 WEEKS: Treasury Secretary will pump $1TRILLION into economy and give families $3K each,"The lockdown affecting 80 million people – nearly one in four of the American population – to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus is likely to last 10 to 12 weeks, or until early June, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said.

Americans are adapting to the biggest change in daily life since World War Two with schools closed, sports canceled and economic upheaval as job losses mount with the shuttering of businesses across many industries.

Hospitals are scrambling for protective equipment for healthcare workers and ventilators as they brace for a wave of patients who will need help breathing. U.S. cases climbed to over 25,000 on Sunday morning and at least 325 people have died, with about half the cases in New York state, according to a Reuters tally.

The virus has killed over 13,000 globally and infected more than 300,000, prompting the likes of California, New York, Illinois and Texas to close non-essential business and ban large gatherings.

Asked how long state-wide stay at home orders could last, Mncuhin said on Fox News Sunday ‘we’re looking at a 10 to 12-week’ scenario’.

Lawmakers in Washington are nearing a deal that could pump a record $1 trillion into the economy to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that he hopes Congress will vote on the bill on Monday. Proposed payments to an average family of four would be $3,000 and would only be one-time for now, he said.

Mnuchin also said the additional liquidity measures for the Federal Reserve aims to help a broad base of U.S. businesses get through next 90 to 120 days.

Questioned about the time it took the US to react to the virus, Mnuchin defended the government’s actions.

‘The intelligence community was giving the White House warnings back in January that the situation coming out of China was very, very serious and would likely end up in a pandemic,’ guest host John Roberts said.

‘Were you ever warned that something like this was coming down pipe because the initial White House reaction appeared to be, “Oh, don’t worry. It’s over there in China.” I was told, why do we need to respond robustly because there’s only 16 cases here.

‘Were you ever warned early on by the intelligence community that this was coming?’

‘You know, I want to be careful talking about specific intelligence. But let me be clear — and this is not just in the U.S., this is around the world. Nobody expected this to take off at the rate it did.’

He added: ‘The situation has changed very quickly and the president has responded to that.’

Time periods for atate-wide shutdowns are indefinite.

But Mnuchin shared lockdown plan details with Roberts when asked whether the time frame was more like six to eight weeks.

‘Well first of all I hope that this gets passed soon as we need the money now,’ Mnuchin began. ‘ I would say that we’re looking at this anywhere from a 10 to 12-week scenario. But again, this situation is moving quickly.’

He added: ‘We need to get the money into the economy now, if we do that we can stabilize the economy. We’re putting a lot of money into the hospitals. I think the president has every expectation this is going to look a lot better four or eight weeks from now.’",2020-02-23 12:48:08+00:00,,0
Corona Virus Outbreak Due To Use Of Dog Meat in Chinese Wuhan Wet Markets,"The coronavirus spreading in China and the SARS outbreak of 2003 have two things in common: Both are from the coronavirus family, and both likely started in wet markets.

At such markets, outdoor stalls are squeezed together to form narrow lanes, where locals and visitors shop for cuts of meat and ripe produce. A stall selling hundreds of caged chickens may abut a butcher counter, where meat is chopped as nearby dogs watch hungrily. Some vendors hock skinned hares, while seafood stalls display glistening fish and shrimp.

Wet markets put people and live and dead animals — dogs, chickens, pigs, snakes, civets, and more — in constant close contact. That makes it easy for a virus to jump from animal to human.

On January 22, authorities in Wuhan, China — where the current outbreak started — banned the trade of live animals at wet markets. The specific market where the outbreak might have begun, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, was shuttered on January 1. The coronavirus that emerged there has so far killed at least 360 people and infected more than 17,400.

“Poorly regulated, live-animal markets mixed with illegal wildlife trade offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spillover from wildlife hosts into the human population,” the Wildlife Conservation Society said in a statement.

Coronaviruses are zoonotic diseases, meaning they spread to people from animals. In the case of SARS, and likely this Wuhan coronavirus outbreak as well, bats were the original hosts. The bats then infected other animals, which transmitted the virus to humans.

Here’s what Chinese wet markets look like.

The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan closed on January 1 after it was found to be the most likely starting point for the outbreak of this coronavirus, called 2019-nCov.

A 61-year-old man was the first person to die from the virus. According to Bloomberg, he was a regular shopper at the Huanan wet market, which sold more than seafood.

Reports indicate that before the Huanan market closed, vendors there sold seafood, meat, and live animals, including chickens, donkeys, sheep, pigs, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs, and snakes.

Wet markets like Huanan are common in China. They’re called wet markets because vendors often slaughter animals in front of customers.

“That means there’s a lot of skinning of dead animals in front of shoppers and, as a result, aerosolizing of all sorts of things,” Emily Langdon, an infectious disease specialist at University of Chicago Medicine, wrote in an article.

A report published on Friday challenges the idea that virus emerged in the Huanan wet market, however.

Chinese scientists found that the first reported case of the Wuhan coronavirus from December had no link to the wet market, according to Science, which cited a report published in the medical journal, The Lancet.

What’s more, 13 of 41 coronavirus cases had no link to the Huanan marketplace, the researchers said. More research is needed to pinpoint the outbreak’s starting point with certainty.",2020-02-08 00:50:11+00:00,,0
China Accused Hiding Number of Corona Virus Deaths Cremating Bodies,"China has today admitted it was too slow to react to the coronavirus outbreak which has sparked a global panic and left at least 213 people dead – amid claims that Beijing could be covering up a higher death toll.

The secretary of the ruling Communist party in Wuhan admitted he felt ‘remorse’ over the outbreak, saying the virus’s impact ‘would have been less’ if measures had been taken sooner.

The killer virus has spread around the world with the first cases in Britain confirmed today as governments scramble to close their borders and retrieve their worried citizens from Wuhan.

China has since imposed a drastic quarantine on Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market and infected humans.

Officials today raised the death toll to 213 with nearly 10,000 people infected, but there are fears that the official figures are ‘way too low’ – sparking claims of a cover-up.

California Governor:’I don’t think the schools are going to open again’,"SACRAMENTO — California’s schools will likely stay closed for the rest of the academic year over coronavirus concerns, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday in a jaw-dropping prediction for families barely settling into new weekday routines with children at home.

“This is a very sobering thing to say,” Newsom said, as he warned that schools are unlikely to reopen in the coming weeks and will more than likely remain closed until the summer break. “I don’t want to mislead you.”

If it holds true, more than 6 million California public school students would remain home for an unprecedented length of time unless the state finds alternatives.

Nearly 99 percent of the state’s schools have closed, though Newsom has not issued a state mandate requiring them to do so, citing concerns about the impact on low-income families.

Newsom also announced Tuesday that he has requested a waiver from the U.S. Department of Education to pause standardized testing.

The governor said he told his daughter Monday night, “‘Honey, I don’t think the schools are going to open again.'”

“Boy, I hope I’m wrong, but I believe that to be the case,” he added.

Newsom said he wanted to be candid with families in California, and that he felt he should explain to everyone what he’s telling his own children based on the information he has.

Earlier Tuesday, Kansas became the first U.S. state to officially close schools for the remainder of the academic year.

The governor signed an executive order last week assuring school districts that they will receive their funding if they close due to the coronavirus and instructing them to use the money for distance learning and other resources for students and families. Days into widespread closures, schools and teachers are blazing their own path on remote instruction, a situation almost no program fully prepared for because K-12 classes are almost universally held in person.

The order requires that closed schools provide meals to students in “non-congregate” settings, continue to pay employees and “to the extent practicable,” arrange for supervision of students during school hours.

Newsom said Tuesday that further guidance will be issued to schools on how to conduct distance learning for the time being.",2020-03-18 20:06:04+00:00,,0
"Coronavirus fears have spurred a stock market sell-off, Potential Market Crash Looming","Wall Street is waking up to the threat of the coronavirus.

The stock market took a dip Monday morning in the face of increasing fears about the coronavirus’s potential impact on the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all ended the day down by more than 3 percent. The Dow tumbled by more than 1,000 points, erasing its gains for the year.

There have been concerns about the coronavirus for months, but worries about itapproaching pandemic status have been building in recent days. As Vox’s Julia Belluz explained, as of Monday, there were more than 79,000 cases of Covid-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus strain) in 29 countries.

While most cases have been found in China, countries around the world have reported surges in recent days, including Italy, Iran, and South Korea. Italy quarantined multiple towns and canceled the Venice Carnival and several football events. And an outbreak on a cruise ship outside Japan has increased concerns, too. “The likelihood that we’re in a pandemic, a new disease that spreads around the world — or that we’re hurtling toward one — seems higher than just a week ago,” Belluz wrote.

The World Health Organization said it believes there’s still time to contain the virus and that its epidemic peak may be declining in China, but other experts believe the virus has already spread widely and anticipate epidemics around the world. Either way, the threat is causing ripples across global stock markets and economies.

An investor survey conducted by the market insight and research firm DataTrek Research released on Sunday found that most investors still believe coronavirus will not cause a global economic recession, and only about one-third of them had made changes to their or their clients’ portfolios, taking into account the risks of the disease. But it’s worth noting the survey was collected between Tuesday and Saturday of last week, before the latest wave of fear-inducing news hit.

In a note to clients on Monday, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at the research firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned that “virus-induced nerves will persist until non-China cases decline” and said there’s still a lot of uncertainty on the impact of the coronavirus. “At this point, no one knows — and no one can know — whether these fears [around the virus] will prove justified, which means that markets are now slaves to the news,” he wrote.

The spread of the disease in China and elsewhere has already impacted global supply chains and travel, and the situation could worsen. Last week, Apple said it would slash sales expectations, noting its smartphone supply was going to slow because so much of its production is based in China, and saying that demand for its devices in China had been harmed. As CNBC noted on Monday, the coronavirus-induced market slide was specifically felt by airlines and chipmakers. And it’s not just US stocks that are suffering — markets around the globe shuddered, too.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Monday told CNBC that the US economy still looks pretty solid, but President Donald Trump’s trade war and coronavirus are cause for concern. “Tariffs — the tariff situation was a big question mark for all kinds of companies. And still is to some degree. But that was front and center for a while. Now, coronavirus is front and center,” he said.

While the coronavirus news and its potential effects on the global economy and markets are worrying, it’s important not to panic. (Today is perhaps not the day to look at your 401(k) balance.) The Dow is just slightly below where it started in 2020, and it’s about 2,000 points above where it was this time a year ago.",2019-02-25 05:53:37+00:00,,0
5-Year-Old Girl Tests Positive for Coronavirus Possibly Infected Other Classmates,"HOWARD COUNTY, MD — Maryland’s first child to test positive for the new coronavirus is a 5-year-old from Howard County who attended Elkridge Elementary School. The state has 107 confirmed cases, up from 85 on Wednesday, the same day the state reported its first coronavirus death, a Prince George’s County man in his 60s with underlying health issues.

“We have our first pediatric case of coronavirus. Coronavirus, as we know, does not discriminate … we are going to continue to see more confirmed cases. We must do our part to flatten the curve and ultimately save lives,” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said at a Thursday afternoon press conference. “Avoid group gatherings, playdates and visitors to your home. Do not congregate in any public private spaces. This means walking trails, basketball courts, playgrounds and more.”

Howard County Health Officer Dr. Maura Rossman said the child was evaluated by medical professionals and sent home to recuperate. They do not believe she shared the virus at school. All schools in Maryland are tentatively closed through March 27.

“Given the timeframe of onset, the child was not an exposure risk to children and staff at school. While this is the first coronavirus case in a child in Maryland, we know that children, teens and young adults are all able to get the virus. It does not discriminate,” Rossman said. “Anyone can get sick regardless of what country and what state and what county they live in and what age they are. We must recognize when children or anyone is sick with the virus that a larger concern is they pass the disease along to seniors or those with underlying health issues. They are the groups more adversely effected and may require hospitalization — and may not recover.”

Rossman emphasized that “now is the time to stay home.”

“In capital letters, STAY HOME. As difficult as it may be, staying home the next couple of weeks will help flatten the curve, slow the virus and save lives,” she said.

People must re-evaluate how they live their lives, Rossman said.

“If you must go out into public, use social distancing … continue to wash your hands and do it frequently. We know this is the single most effective way to prevent getting sick,” she said.",2020-03-20 00:53:44+00:00,,0
Government Considering Sending Every American $1000 Right Away as Global Recession Looms,"The idea of quickly sending every American adult a $1,000 check in order to stimulate the rapidly faltering American economy began to gain some traction on Monday in the halls of power in Washington D.C. with Republican Senator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) coming out in favor of it even as the stock market sustained its largest single-day percentage drop ever on top of what had already been a bad week.

A thousand-dollar-a-month “Freedom Dividend” had been the centerpiece talking point of Andrew Yang’s campaign for the Democratic nomination for president in recent months before he dropped out of the race. What just a few weeks ago seemed like a quixotic idea may actually happen far faster than anyone ever anticipated, albeit for only one or perhaps two months, depending on how long Americans find themselves stranded at home with severely reduced job activity until the threat of the coronavirus is deemed past.

Despite the seeming similarity to Yang’s proposal, there is a big difference between a one-of stimulus check for $1,000 and the long-debated theories surrounding a “Universal Basic Income” which calls for such a program to continue month-after-month for every adult citizen in perpetuity. There are; however, a couple of precedents: In 2001 and again in 2009 the government mailed out checks to some taxpayers in order to try and directly counter the effects of a recession.

US jails begin releasing prisoners to stop spread of Covid-19 infections,"US jails are to let out inmates as cases of coronavirus infections are being reported in prisons.

New York City is releasing “vulnerable” prisoners, the mayor said on Wednesday, days after Los Angeles and Cleveland freed hundreds of inmates.

Prison reform advocates say those in jail are at higher risk of catching and passing on Covid-19.

There have been more than 9,400 cases of Covid-19 and 152 deaths in the US so far, according to estimates.

Globally there are some 220,000 confirmed cases and over 8,800 deaths.

What happened in New York City?

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday that city officials will this week identify individuals for release, including people who were arrested for minor crimes and those most vulnerable to infection due to underlying health problems.

His announcement came hours after a guard and a prisoner tested positive for coronavirus at Rikers Island prison, where disgraced former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, 68, is a high-profile inmate.

Weinstein will be moved to a different state prison, an official said on Wednesday.

Other New York prisons, such as Sing Sing, have had inmates test positive for coronavirus and one employee for the state’s corrections department has died from it .

What have other US jurisdictions done?

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department reduced it’s inmate population by 600 in the last two weeks, officials said on Tuesday.

“Our population within our jails is a vulnerable population just by who they are, where they are located, so we’re protecting that population from potential exposure,” Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters earlier this week.

The LA County jail system is the largest prison system in the world with an average population of around 22,000 prisoners.

Mr Villaneuva disclosed that arrests in the county are also down, from an average of 300 per weekend to only 60 in mid-March.",2020-03-20 00:22:39+00:00,,0
People are Snorting Cocaine & Drinking Bleach to Cure Coronavirus,"Jesus Christ, sometimes I really hate the internet. People come up with the strangest and most stupid things I’ve ever heard of. Like this nonsense. Apparently, there are rumors going around on social media that drinking chlorine dioxide and snorting cocaine can cure the coronavirus. WHAT!?

Reality check, guys this is not true. If you actually believe this, you seriously need to go back to school. It really blows my mind that we have to remind people about something like this. As far as I know, snorting cocaine has absolutely no medical benefits and well, it happens to be illegal. Not only that, but the FDA has been warning people for years that drinking bleach not only ruins your system, but causes severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, life-threatening low blood pressure which is caused by dehydration, and acute liver failure.

Now, all though chlorine dioxide isn’t exactly bleach, it is toxic, and well, you should not be ingesting it to cure Covid-19. I get it guys, this whole coronavirus outbreak is scary, the whole world is freaking out. Which is why we shouldn’t even joke about fake cures things like this. This is dangerous, there are a lot of people who actually depend on the internet for information and there could be serious side effects.

These two factors will not kill the coronavirus, rather they will kill you. Bleach isn’t a miracle mineral solution. According to the CDC,the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. What does that mean, well, the virus is spread mainly from person to person between people who are in close contact with one another within 6 feet. Health officials state it can also be passed through respiratory droplets which are produced when an infected person sneezes or coughs on another person. So what can we do to prevent getting sick?



Even though you’ve probably heard this a million times, the best way is to wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or more and after you’ve been in a public place, you sneeze, cough, or blow your nose. If you don’t have water accessible to you, you can use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and covers all surfaces of your hands. You should also avoid touching your nose, mouth, eyes, and face overall.

If you start to feel ill, it’s better to stay at home and get medical care so you don’t expose others. If you are sick, you should wear face masks when you’re around other people and before you enter a Health Care Provider’s office. No, you do not need to wear a face mask if you are not sick unless you’re caring for someone who is sick. Last but not least remember that cleaning will be your best friend. This includes doorknobs, tables, light switch, handles, yes, countertops, phone, I can go on and on and on.

Moral of the story, just be aware of your surroundings people. Oh and also, don’t do cocaine and don’t drink bleach, that’s just stupid y’all",2020-03-19 20:15:31+00:00,,0

US President Donald Trump on Monday suggested to his supporters that he might fire Anthony Fauci, the country’s chief expert on infectious diseases, from his second-term cabinet.

While holding a campaign rally in Florida in the early hours of the day, Trump took issue with the media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting the crowd to chant “Fire Fauci.”

“Don’t tell anybody but let me wait until a little bit after the election”, Trump replied, as quoted by CNN, thanking his supporters for the advice.

A video of the moment has been circulating in social media.

The move was deemed necessary due to fears of possible mass unrest over election results.

The security boost is in preparation for election day and mass protests and rioting that may follow, especially if the outcome is not immediately certain. Many business owners in large US cities, including Washington DC, have similarly pessimistic expectations and have been boarding up their shops against possible vandalism and looting.

The White House used additional barriers earlier this year when mass protests were happening near the complex in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota.

Anti-Lockdown Protests Erupt Across Spain,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Social unrest erupted across Spanish cities for the second consecutive night on Saturday after the government’s decision to extend a six-month state of emergency in response to the second wave of COVID-19 infections.

Anti-lockdown protesters flooded the streets of Madrid and Barcelona on Saturday night. At least 32 people were arrested and 12 injured when demonstrations turned violent with police in Madrid. Other protests were seen in Malaga, Vitoria, Valencia, Santander, and Burgos, reported RT News.

On Saturday evening, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, called for calm as the violent protests intensified. He tweeted:

“Only from responsibility, unity, and sacrifice will we be able to defeat the pandemic that devastates all countries. Violent and irrational behavior by minority groups is intolerable. It is not the way.”

The extension of the national state of emergency order comes as coronavirus infection cases, on Saturday alone, topped 26,000, one of the highest totals since the start of the pandemic.

“Lawlessness” was the best way to describe the chaotic events in Madrid, tweeted Insider Paper.

RT New said, “protesters clashed with police in the capital city of Madrid, vandalizing ATMs, as well as breaking and burning trash cans in the city center.”

Meanwhile, in Barcelona, anti-lockdown protesters were upset about the nationwide curfew and how it would continue to crush the economy.

Trump Blasts Europe’s ‘Draconian’ New Lockdowns,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

US President Donald Trump has criticized several European countries for announcing fresh nationwide lockdowns, describing the measures as “draconian.”

“What the hell are they [Europe] doing?” Trump told a campaign rally in Michigan. “I think I’ll go over and explain it to them.”

He warned voters that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, would mimic those tough measures and pledged to never shut down parts of the US again.

“I am delivering the great American comeback and we are not having any lockdowns. That I can tell you, there’s no lockdowns,” he said to loud cheers from the crowd.

On Saturday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a strict new lockdown would take effect across England from Thursday until early December.

The country follows Germany, Austria and France who announced new curbs on movement this week amid a huge surge in coronavirus infections.

Both candidates for Tuesday’s US presidential election made a last-minute scramble to attract voters in battleground states. Biden — who polls say is maintaining an overall lead over Trump — hit back over the president’s record on the pandemic.

“More than 230,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 — and Donald Trump has given up on trying to get the virus under control,” he said on Twitter.

“He may have quit on you, but I promise I never will.”

As well as Michigan, Trump was visiting Iowa, North Carolina; Georgia and Florida for further rallies Sunday. Biden was traveling to Pennsylvania to address his supporters and will be joined on stage in Philadelphia by Lady Gaga and John Legend.

US ‘positioned poorly’

Meanwhile, the US government’s top infectious diseases expert said the country should prepare for “a whole lot of hurt” in the weeks ahead due to surging coronavirus cases.

Dr. Anthony Fauci told the Washington Post that the US “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” to stem rising cases as more people gather indoors during the colder fall and winter months.

Fauci, who is on the White House coronavirus task force, added that he believes Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden “is taking it [the pandemic] seriously from a public health perspective,” while Trump is “looking at it from a different perspective.”

In response, White House spokesman Judd Deere said Fauci had decided “to play politics” right before Tuesday’s presidential election.",11/2/20 9:41,,0
Report: Biden Presidency Would Add $11 TRILLION To National Debt,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

If Joe Biden were to be elected his Presidency would cost American taxpayers $11 trillion dollars, according to a study by The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.

The conservative 501 found that Biden’s proposals on social security, health care, climate and infrastructure could plunge the US into a debt crisis.

Speaking to the Daily Caller, author of the report Brian Riedl noted that “The policies he’s proposing are going to endanger the economy over the long term,” adding “$4 trillion in new taxes, which is the biggest tax increase since the end of World War II, as well as $11 trillion in new spending, certainly more regulation, a higher minimum wage. All of that is going to weaken the economy.”

For those interested, I've released the new 2020 version of my budget chartbook. 100 pages of charts that defy conventional wisdom on budget, spending, tax, and deficits. You can download the chartbook here – https://t.co/rKZ20fxvuk — Brian Riedl 🧀 (@Brian_Riedl) October 27, 2020

Biden has proposed $2.4 trillion in coronavirus stimulus spending, as well as $2 trillion for climate and infrastructure, and a $1.5 trillion health care expansion. It is estimated that education spending will amount to $750 billion under Biden, which includes a free college plan.

Biden has offered little in the way of explaining how the costs will be covered, other than tax hikes, which he claims will be targeted at large corporations.

The problem is beginning with a $13 trillion baseline deficit over the decade, adding $11 trillion in new spending promises, and then hoping a $3.5 trillion tax increase on the rich will make the numbers work. Eventually, big middle-class benefits require big middle class taxes. https://t.co/G6AmsbfytG — Brian Riedl 🧀 (@Brian_Riedl) October 5, 2020

Bets are in, and the odds look heavily in Trump’s favor and it’s because the betting tables have all the right data.

The numbers were crunched using figures from Biden’s campaign website, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Congressional Budget Office.

“It’s absolutely unsustainable,” Riedl noted adding that “The danger is that eventually the interest costs will bury us. When you borrow that much money, all it takes is a small increase in interest rates to completely bury the federal budget.”

“Ultimately, we’re going to face a reckoning that requires either significant reforms to programs like Social Security and Medicare, or a possible doubling of middle class taxes,” Riedl warned, declaring that “There’s really no third option.”

“The worst case scenario is that politicians continue to pour gasoline on the fire by enacting even more spending, which just accelerates a debt crisis,” Riedl urged.

Under President Trump, the deficit has remained under $1 trillion each year. However, it is projected to jump to almost 4 times that this year due to coronavirus spending.",11/2/20 5:28,,0
UK government justifies 2nd national lockdown using outdated death scenarios that may be 4 times too high – researchers,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

The British government has used out-of-date death-scenario modelling to illustrate the coronavirus crisis and justify a second national lockdown, new research shows.

The selection of data has not been based on the current reality, Carl Heneghan, the director of the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University said, in comments published on Monday.

The death forecasts could be four to five times too high, Heneghan insists.

I cannot understand why they have used this data, when there are far more up-to-date forecasts from Cambridge that they could have accessed, which show something very different.

The government’s scientific advisers showed a scenario from Cambridge University at a Downing Street press conference on Saturday, and graphs suggested England could see 4,000 daily deaths early next month. But this data was based on different models from at least three weeks ago, Heneghan and Daniel Howdon of Leeds Institute of Health Sciences explained on Monday.

In a insightful Interview with the BBC in 1999, David Bowie properly predicts the terrifying reality of what the internet has done to our society.

The Cambridge estimated projection for November 1 is 1,000 deaths, the experts said.

The most recent research from Cambridge forecasts 240 daily deaths for next week, while this figure stands at around 500 in the second half of November.

Two model estimates presented by the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) have already proven to be invalid, according to Heneghan and Howdon. They say these analyses need checking to verify whether the lower estimates could reflect the actual data.

Britain’s PM Boris Johnson on Saturday ordered England back into a national lockdown from Thursday morning, until December 2, and the SAGE figures were behind the decision.

How Long Will It Take To Count All The Votes?,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

For months the American people have been told that we may not know the winner of the presidential election right away like we normally do.

So if we aren’t going to have a winner on November 3rd, when will we finally have a clear result?

Well, that is going to depend on how long it takes to count the votes, and that is going to be different for each state.

I know that is a frustrating answer, but every one of our 50 states has different election laws, and things have been greatly complicated in 2020 by the fact that so many people will be voting by mail.

A new Project Veritas video exposes even more corruption now taking place in the Republican party!

So far, more than 46 million Americans have already voted by mail, and that number just keeps growing with each passing day.

Some states allow mail-in ballots to be counted before Election Day, but a majority of states do not…

A majority of states won’t start actually counting ballots until the morning of Election Day or after polls close. Most counting rules have remained unchanged this year, though some states have adjusted their timelines due to the pandemic to ease the burden of increased absentee ballots.

So that means that there will be tens of millions of mail-in ballots that will be piled up waiting to be counted in addition to all of the ballots that come in on Election Day.

I feel sorry for those that have to open up all of those ballots and get them counted, because that is going to be a monumental task.

As I discussed yesterday, there are six key swing states that are pretty much going to determine the outcome of this election. In three of them, the lack of a sufficient head start in counting ballots is likely to greatly delay voting results…

But final results in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan could be unclear on election night because these states are expected to be the three slowest to count the high volume of absentee ballots. The reason: Pennsylvania and Wisconsin don’t allow the processing of mail-in ballots to begin until Election Day and Michigan only has a 10-hour start, compared to other states that start that can start the process days or weeks in advance.

Whoever wins Pennsylvania is probably going to win the presidency, but it could be quite a while before we get a final result from that state.

You see, the truth is that counting mail-in ballots is much more tedious that running normal ballots through a machine. There are several steps involved, and each step takes time…

Processing absentee ballots generally includes steps short of tabulating them — such as removing them from the envelope, confirming voter eligibility, matching signatures to what’s on record and scanning them.

And on top of everything else, sometimes unexpected problems occur.

For example, ballot counting machines in one county in Texas have been “rejecting about one-third of mail-in ballots” and authorities are scrambling to get this issue resolved…

Ballot scanning machines are rejecting about one-third of mail-in ballots returned by voters in Tarrant County. The problem has impacted more than 22,000 ballots so far. Ballot board members are now working in 12-hour shifts to accurately replicate the ballots so they can be counted.

As I have warned before, you will want to vote in person to give yourself the best chance of having your vote actually count.

In addition to everything that I have already discussed, it is important to remember that mail-in votes will continue to be accepted in many states long after Election Day is over.

I know that sounds really bizarre, but this is what is actually going to happen. In fact, Washington State will count votes that are received as late as November 23rd…

The last day to vote in-person in the general election is Nov. 3. Absentee and mail-in ballots also typically must be received or postmarked by that date, if not earlier, depending on a state’s rules. That leaves some room for mail-in ballots to be received after Election Day. In Washington State, mail-in ballots received as late as Nov. 23 are still valid, as long as they were postmarked by Nov. 3.

National polls have shown that Biden voters are much more likely to vote by mail and Trump voters are much more likely to vote in person.

The votes that are cast in person will be counted very quickly. Meanwhile, the votes that are sent in by mail will take weeks to fully count.

The mainstream media and the big tech companies have been working very hardto mentally prepare us for a massive “blue shift” after Election Day. One of the reasons why they are so adamant that Trump should not declare victory on November 3rd is because they are confident that Joe Biden will ultimately win once all of the mail-in ballots are finally counted.

In some states we will have final results almost immediately, but in other states counting could take quite a few weeks.

But the counting cannot take too long, because by law election results must be officially certified by certain deadlines…

According to Ballotpedia, citing state laws, six states must certify election results within a week of the general election; 26 states and Washington, D.C., have a deadline between Nov. 10 and Nov. 30; 14 have a deadline in December, and four do not have deadlines in their state laws. Among key battleground states, those deadlines range from Nov. 11 (Pennsylvania) to Dec. 1 (Nevada and Wisconsin). For potential battleground Texas, it is Dec. 3.

I don’t know how some of those states are going to possibly meet those deadlines.

In particular, I have no idea how Pennsylvania is going to be done counting by November 11th. Hopefully they have a vast army of counters and a whole lot of coffee.

To give you an idea of how long it takes to count mail-in ballots, just consider what we witnessed in California earlier this year…

Consider this year’s California primary, in which 5.8 million people voted for president. Only 3 million of those ballots were counted by election night; the other 2.8 million votes took an additional seven weeks to count, said John Couvillon, a pollster and political analyst.

If it took California seven weeks to count a couple million mail-in ballots, how in the world is Pennsylvania going to count a similar number of mail-in ballots in just one week?

Personally, I am anticipating that this election is going to be a colossal mess. As I have been documenting on The Most Important News, voting anomalies have already been popping up all over the nation, and I think that counting all of the mail-in ballots is going to take much more time than anticipated.

And any legal battles over the counting of the votes will just make the process even more painful.

We were once a great example for the rest of the world, but in 2020 we are going to show the rest of the planet the exact wrong way to conduct an election, and that is a real shame.",10/28/20 2:30,,0
Sniffer Dogs Could Be Used to Detect if Someone is Infected With COVID,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Sniffer dogs that can detect if someone is infected with COVID-19 could be used to patrol public areas such as airports and other busy venues in the near future.

Health minister Lord Bethell praised an “extremely exciting” trial taking place in the UK that tests whether dogs can be trained to identify unique odours associated with the coronavirus infection.

With Finland having already deployed corona-sniffing dogs at its main international airport, similar measures could soon be rolled out across the west.

UK Secretary of State Matt Hancock, an ardent lockdown advocate, will visit the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to see for himself the accuracy of the tests.

“Dogs can be used as a way of screening crowds in places like airports and high-density venues,” said Lord Bethell.

And there you were thinking you’d just have to tolerate masks, mandatory government apps and vaccines to get about in the “new normal”.

As we previously highlighted, robots are already being rolled out to monitor mask compliance, while robot dogs in Singapore are already patrolling parks and other public spaces to enforce social distancing.

ROGER STONE: How the Democrats Plan to Steal the 2020 Election,"It is now just a few days until America finally renders its fateful choice for President on on Election Day 2020. But Democrat manipulations to buy time to conduct as much voter fraud as possible have made it more like Election MONTH 2020.

As President Donald Trump tirelessly barnstorms the country, firing up voters from all walks of life at increasingly massive rallies that epitomize political Americana, Democrat Joe Biden is staggering around the political stage, desperately hoping to run out the clock and avoid any of the exploding controversy around his treasonous secret business dealings with the communist Chinese, among other appalling revelations.

Biden’s campaign communications team – also known as the entire corporate “mainstream” media and all major social media and information platforms – are scurrying about crazily in an unprecedented suppression and censorship rampage to ensure that the growing body of authenticated evidence of Joe Biden’s active complicity in his son Hunter’s influence pedaling in Ukraine, China and Kazakhstan receives zero coverage, effectively bamboozling the American electorate.

While his cynical media protectorate shields the doddering Delaware Democrat from long-overdue exposure of his appalling corruption and greed, Biden cowers in the basement bunker of his sprawling multimillion dollar estate in Chateau Country, Delaware. Biden’s “campaign” is now pretty basic: no rallies, no press conferences, no exposure to media questions, no impromptu (or any) interaction with actual voters, and not a peep about any of the sludge now bubbling up out of the Biden Crime Family sewer.

Every once in a while Biden’s handlers (controllers) prop him up and drag him out to a contrived platform appearance somewhere in Pennsylvania just a short drive from the Biden bunker/compound, where the cognitively-impaired 78 year old bumbles his way through jumbotron teleprompted remarks to some small highly-screened group of voters, from a safe distance of course (no handshaking, baby kissing, or even elbow bumping), just so his media army can show the world proof of life.

Before going dark (and into hiding) Biden explicitly promised (threatened) to raise taxes (a bit of bravado that didn’t not work out so well for another former Democrat Vice-President running for the top job four years too late, Walter Mondale). In a bit of uplifting optimism, the mask-pusher from Scranton-Claymont predicted a “dark winter” for America – nothing like gloom and doom to inspire a country suffering under Democrat lockdown mania. In short, Biden is doing the worst thing any political candidate can do – he’s sitting on a lead, trying to run out the clock. Biden’s effort is so lifeless and lackluster that I am reminded of something President Nixon used to say to me: “Stone, in politics the only thing worse than being wrong is being boring.”

Donald Trump, by contrast, has stolen (or brilliantly rewritten) a page from the last landslide Republican president, Ronald Reagan, by bombarding Democrat strongholds with an upbeat message of hope and sunny optimism. The endlessly-energetic Trump lays out his impressive record and reassures voters that, contrary to Joe Biden’s vision of a Dark Winter for America, ‘the best is yet to come.’

Touting his extraordinary record of job creation and wage growth, this president dominates the political stage as a happy warrior, but also one who is equally fearless in excoriating the Democrats and their propaganda fluffers in the corporate mainstream (fake news) media. His tireless come-from-behind effort is interesting, entertaining and inspirational.

His Trump Rallies are becoming the stuff of political legend. But even moreso, they are presidential campaign rocket fuel. While the President draws strength and resolve from the enormous crowds of fired-up Americans who flock to see him, they, in turn, are infused with his infectious energy, moved to action by the confidence and enthusiasm he imparts with his every word and his commanding presence.

Democrats know their candidate is weak and that his ‘supporters’ have the intensity of a room full of dental patients waiting for a tooth extraction. Their sum total of their message is “we hate Trump”, higher taxes, more regulation and a re-constituted reign of error by the Democrats’ bellicose, ossified political lifers, only now with a burgeoning splinter of aggressive proto-communist zealots driving their demagogic ideology.

Desperate Democrat power-seekers and their Trump-deranged RINO fellow travelers know Biden’s lead is dwindling (if he ever really had one, given the Trump-hate media and political class’s pathological inability to utter so much as a breath that does not denigrate or diminish the object of their endless scorn and vicious hatred). The leftist Democrat shock troops are already torquing up their (well-organized, well-funded) mob violence on the streets of New York and Philadelphia – a glimmer of the diabolical plans by which they will to go to any lengths and use any means necessary to defeat Donald Trump…or destroy the country in the process.

They are already in the process of resorting to widespread voter fraud to stop the quickly rising Trump and have troweled up a practical army of at least 600 sleazy lawfare specialists from the bottom of the Democrat lawyer cesspool, eagerly scheming to pressure election boards to ratify various Democrat election-stealing fraud schemes like ballot harvesting. While this noxious army of political ambulance chasers swarm over the land seeking to manufacture delay, disarray and uncertainty until or unless they can rig the defeat of Donald Trump, the Biden Democrat-fomented criminal street mobs will augment this chaos-driven pressure with violent “protests” and destructive riots.

From all of the polling I have examined, this presidential race may be as close as the Bush v Gore race in 2000 and the 1960 contest between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Bush v. Gore was, of course, resolved in the U.S. Supreme Court. Kennedy versus Nixon was resolved by the magnanimity and patriotic fidelity of Vice-President Richard Nixon. Attorneys for Nixon had already gathered more than enough evidence of widespread and systematic Democrat voter fraud in Illinois and Texas (which was extremely well-documented at the time in a detailed series of articles in The New York Herald Tribune), but Nixon selflessly decided against putting the country through the agony of a divisive, drawn-out legal process to eliminate the fruits of Democrat fraud and honestly determine who was the rightful President. Interestingly, American war hero and straight arrow, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, joined a number of prominent Americans urging Nixon to wage a no holds-barred legal challenge to the questionable victory of Democrat John Kennedy.

If my premonition of a razor-thin margin of victory by one candidate or the other turns out to be accurate, it is absolutely imperative that the Trump Campaign, the Republican National Committee and the “Stop The Steal” organization of Republican lawyers working to ensure the integrity of this election, ready to sort out the what and the who of the Democrats’ election fraud, immediately mobilize around one effort. They must have voters lined up and ready who have standing to file the appropriate legal petitions, pleadings and motions to challenge questionable results and expose fraudulent activities wherever they have occurred. They must be prepared to collect and submit persuasive hard evidence detailing all voter fraud and expose those who planned, paid for, solicited or perpetrated these crimes.

As I said, Democrats have an illegal ballot harvesting plan in full swing and are coordinating with the foreign-funded domestic terror groups BLM and Antifa to foment violence and political instability in order the steal the 2020 election. Behind all of this organized Democrat corruption is a sleazy legal trickster and Democrat hatchet man named Norm Eisen, who actually wrote a manual or guidebook outlining how he was behind the same type of violent insurrection in other countries – and how he plans to use the same tactics to hijack our election next Tuesday. Eisen’s international trademark is a scenario in which insurrectionist forces engineer various contrivances to loudly contest a national election, while also mobilizing massive protests in support of seizing the election in their favor. These astro-turfed riots are falsely portrayed as “peaceful protests” or acts of civil disobedience, when they are in fact violent destructive mobs.

Eisen wrote a detailed “how to” book for radical revolution, literally called the “Playbook”. This diabolical manual for mass manipulation lays out scenarios for the overthrow of democratically elected governments overseas, which Eisen sought to topple. It includes plans for engineering election fraud scenarios and then using election fraud as the pretext to engineer mass protests intended to cast doubt on the legitimacy of election result.

This un-American slimeball Eisen has been a chief architect of the underhanded, dishonest and even seditious impeachment efforts waged against President Trump, as well as over 180 frivolous or malicious lawsuits against Trump and his political allies. He had already authored ten articles of impeachment against President Trump before the President’s phone call to the President of Ukraine, which Democrats absurdly distorted, misrepresented and inflated into their laughable grounds for impeachment, had even taken place. Eisen was Special Counsel to the Democrats for the impeachment process he had himself engineered.

This ruthless lawyer thug and Democrat zealot Eisen will employ the usual Democrat lawfare tricks to try to steal or overturn the 2020 election, with street thugs as his Plan B. Republicans must be prepared to fight this effort both in the courts and through mobilization of legitimate peaceful protests.

The big stash of ballots that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar got caught with trace directly to Eisen’s ballot-harvesting operation. This is but one strand in a sprawling vote fraud web which can be traced, and proved if necessary, to similar criminal operations underway in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia and Arizona.

I firmly believe, and can look to their long history of engaging in it, that Democrat criminals are, and will be, engaging in widespread voter fraud in various forms including mail-in voting abuse, illegal ballot harvesting, multiple votes cast by one individual, votes cast in the name of persons who are deceased or no longer reside in the voting jurisdiction and manipulation of computerized voting machine tabulations. I know that there will be credible evidence of this everywhere it is perpetrated, if for no other reason than, while Democrat masterminds like Eisen may be crafty little manipulators who slither around in the shadows undetected, the average Democrat thug hired, or otherwise willing, to carry out the necessary election fraud tasks is going to reflect the Democrat base in being either sloppy, stupid, or both, and will leave a trail of evidence behind.

The President’s lawyers and a supporting network of diligent attorneys willing to join the fight against this criminal effort to steal the presidency and more, must be prepared and organized to collect and catalog credible evidence showing the Democrats’ systematic vote fraud campaign, while preserving all available legal options to challenge the results, even if (when) the fake news media works overtime to stampede the public into rubber-stamping a fraudulent election, stealing the presidency if not the Congress too.

To pull off their version of a “color revolution”, Democrats and their fake news propaganda machine in mainstream media have set up a cynical diversionary effort. In recent weeks, corporate-owned Democrat shill media has been in overdrive falsely and maliciously smearing and defaming a fraternal organization called the “Proud Boys,” an extraordinarily small group of mostly young men of all races and identities (the national chairman is a black latino of Cuban descent) who are essentially a drinking society. Truly vile Democrat stooges in media have published libelous and slanderous statements falsely labeling these men as “white supremacists.” Having absolutely ZERO evidence to substantiate this defamation, all they do is cite a criminal front group run by leftist zealots called the “Southern Poverty Law Center” or SPLC (an organization whose name is three lies in one).

The radical leftists behind this shady defamation factory disguised as a public interest group are neither neutral nor objective, and are a credible arbiter of absolutely nothing on this planet. They have been a malicious propaganda generator against anyone with views that are anything right of the Chamber of Commerce. This evil organization was essentially setup as a money-making scam for left-wing fundraiser Morris Dees, used to fleece well-intentioned low-dollar liberal donors of their money, thinking they were sending money to fight extremists on the right, like Gerald Ford. Meanwhile, they defame as a Nazi or Klansman anyone who doesn’t actively profess twisted hard left doctrine or bow down before the likes of Elizabeth Warren.

That said, their lies about the Proud Boys have been fodder for a despicable smear campaign by the corporate Democrat media which has progressed to totally-false utterly-fabricated insinuations that the Proud Boys are going to suppress votes by menacing , harassing and assaulting voters at polling places.

I predict here and now that no Trump-supporter anywhere of any kind will in any way intimidate or harass voters at the polls, nor even attempt such conduct. Because the left always accuses their opponents of whatever crimes or treachery in which they are themselves engaged, or planning to engage, I am concerned about the Norm Eisen – Mark Elias – Neal Katyal scheme to steal the 2020 election and the presidency, using Black Lives Matter and Antifa to intimidate and harass Trump voters at the polling places in order to suppress the Trump vote – particularly among older citizens.

The head Democrat election thief Eisen calls his ballot fraud/lawfare/street violence operation (what else?) a “Voter Protection Project”. It is anything but that, but one must acknowledge how clever these liberals can be in their nefarious scheming and scamming.

BLM and Antifa have demonstrated beyond question that they have the numbers, funding, structure and organization to stage such violent suppressive incidents at carefully selected polling locations around the country. The notion that Antifa is, per Joe Biden in the first presidential debate, merely “an idea” or “ideology” and not an actual organization is, aside from being lunacy, disproved by their criminally violent and well-organized actions in recent months. Someone is paying for trucks, buses, U-Hauls and pallets of bricks, as well as the lawyers who show up instantaneously with bail money whenever one of these violent terrorists is arrested.

That America is awash with dark money to fund these terrorist operations and the insurrection they seek to foment is beyond question at this point. These are the thugs who will lead the wave of violence that Mr. Eisen and his cohorts have planned to use the pressure tactic against the vote counters, while Mr. Katyal and his band of manipulative lawyer thugs badger and threaten them with legal maneuvers.

In recent days the Democrat propaganda fake news media juggernaut has taken on the practice of distorting virtually everything I say, ever since the Soviet-style show trial I was put through in Washington D.C. This has only escalated since President’s humanitarian act of justice and mercy, commuting the outlandish sentence slapped on me by the vicious partisan judge who made sure I would never receive a fair trial and sought to incarcerate me immediately in a prison rife with COVID-19 cases, literally putting my life at great risk to sate their partisan malice. The President’s clemency by which I was able to escape certain death in a federal penitentiary has degenerate leftist zealots feeling denied the fruits of their lawless abuses of power and corruption of our courts as their illegitimate tool for political score-settling. Many will surely attack me for revealing the truth in this article.

Since they now twist and distort anything I say publicly, let me state it clearly and unequivocally: I renounce violence of any kind as a solution to any dispute over the outcome of the election taking place just days from now. If there is credible evidence of voter fraud sufficient to distort the election results, and the fake news media and violent shock-troops of the Democrat Party should attempt to stampede the country into accepting the illegitimate election of Joe Biden as president, the dispute must nonetheless be settled in the courts, not in the streets.

"ACLU Suing Police Across US For “Brutality” in Response to Riots, Looting","Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

In addition to having to deal with inept politicians and their respective police forces being harassed and assaulted across the U.S., cities are also starting to face another hurdle: lawsuits are stacking up alleging “police brutality” in dealing with “peaceful” protesters.

The New York ACLU, for example, has sued Mayor Bill de Blasio and police leadership and officers for how the city responded to protests over the summer, claiming NYPD used “brutal force,” according to Bloomberg.

Which is funny, because all we remember seeing from the summer was property destruction, looting, boarded up businesses and all hell generally breaking loose while Mayor De Blasio appeared to do nothing at all.

But, we digress. Regardless of whether they have merit, the lawsuits in New York and in other cities create even more financial liabilities for many U.S. cities that are already under distress. Similar cases are also being filed in Omaha, Nebraska; Los Angeles; New York; and Minneapolis.

A lawsuit filed this week against the NYPD said that they “unnecessarily used tools like batons and pepper spray on demonstrators and deployed tactics like kettling, in which police surround and trap a group in a location.”

Otherwise known as maintaining law and order.

The lawsuit, which also claims false imprisonment, alleges that the tactics resulted in a broken arm for one plaintiff. Daniel Lambright, an ACLU attorney, said: “What everybody saw in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder was egregious police misconduct and violations of protesters’ rights across the country but particularly in New York City. We don’t think there was a ‘bad apple’ problem. We think these were part of policies and practices endorsed by the mayor and the commissioner.”

Yes, the same mayor who, as far as we can remember, has worked to decriminalize everything he can get his hands on, from turnstile jumpers to people who urinate in public.

De Blasio commented: “From what I’ve heard of the lawsuit’s allegation, it doesn’t sound right at all to me. You know, there’s been a conscious effort for seven years now to change the relationship between the NYPD and communities.”

The lawsuits put economic pressure on cities when they can least afford it. State and local governments face a $467 billion decline in revenue from 2020 to 2022 as a result of the pandemic, Bloomberg notes:

In some localities, public safety already exceeds a third of general fund spending. Louisville, Kentucky, where Breonna Taylor was killed by police in March, spends 29% of its general fund budget on police. In Minnesota and Omaha, it’s 35% and 36%, respectively. New York City spends nearly 6% of its vast general fund on police, which comes out to more than $5 billion. Misconduct payouts are a further way departments pull on city purse strings.

Ironically, Joanna Schwartz, a professor at the UCLA School of Law, said that the lawsuits – filed against several cities where “defunding the police” is being called for by protesters – would “force cities to spend more on police.”",10/30/20 9:40,,0
The Fed’s Balance Sheet May Be Headed to $40–$50 Trillion,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

President Trump has said often that he had “created the greatest economy the world has ever seen, until the China virus came.”

Maybe some people believe that, but if the economy was so great why did the Fed keep interest rates at zero and its balance sheet at $4 trillion?

The president is bragging about the third quarter GDP bump; however, as David Rosenberg tweeted, “Even with the Q3 GDP snapback, a snapback that is now stalling, 2020 likely goes down with a –4% print, by far the worst year for the economy in the post-WWII era.”

Maybe the economy wasn’t so hot. Danielle DiMartino Booth, who once worked for Richard Fisher at the Dallas Fed, told Raoul Pal on Real Vision,

September the 16th [2019], when they launched Not QE. Because the inversion of the 2s 10s had passed the 30-day mark, and they’re like, oh my god, history says that we’re in recession. Well, no kidding, we’re in recession. World trade was contracting for the entire year of 2019. Lacy Hunt will tell you, you have to go back to the double-dip recession of the 1980s or 2007- 2009, that era, before you had global contraction in global trade. Of course, we were headed into recession. But it was very slow.

There were the good old days when the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet footed to all of $800 billion in assets. In November 2008, the depth of the great recession, the Fed’s assets exploded to over $2 trillion. By 2015, Fed total assets had reached $4.4 trillion. Of course, when coronavirus hit, Fed assets popped to over $7 trillion.

Some people predict $10 trillion by year-end 2020. Who knows? Jerome Powell is pushing for fiscal stimulus and claims his operation has more ammunition if forced to use it. DiMartino Booth told Pal,

The Hippocratic Oath is nowhere in the Eccles building. They don’t understand Do No Harm. They don’t understand Do Nothing. They can’t. And the market and market participants, they need to know that the Fed is doing something, because if they don’t, they’re just staring at a pile of insolvent crap. So they have to know that there is something being done on behalf of them. And the reason that every Fed official has been begging for stimulus spending is they want $3 or $4 trillion of new product out there to buy and continue to aggressively grow the balance sheet.

To put it simply, the Fed needs more bond issuance to buy.

As it is now, the Treasury issues, primary dealers buy, and then the Fed buys what the rest of the market doesn’t. There is talk to take the primary dealers out of the equation, as DiMartino Booth said,

Even if they don’t reopen the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 to allow the Fed to buy Treasuries at auction, which would require the law to change, what difference does it make if—and you see, you see the ticks flow. You see foreign investors stepping back from our Treasury market, meaning the Fed had to step in. So if the Fed is effectively absorbing Treasury issuance, why wouldn’t you call it monetization by any other name, if it’s de facto?

Felix Zulauf, owner and president of Zulauf Asset Management, told Grant Williams and Peter Fleckenstein on The End Game podcast that the government can’t absorb higher rates. He said the world’s central banks must take whatever paper governments issue. The result by the end of the decade will be a Federal Reserve balance sheet totaling $40 to $50 trillion. Williams and Fleckenstein audibly gasped upon hearing Zulauf say this.

Once the world’s central banks reach their limit, Zuluaf believes sovereign interest rates will be capped and pension plans and individual retirement accounts will be forced to buy the paper.

Negative rates will continue in Europe, leading to a nationalization of the banks. The same will happen in the US, with real interest rates being negative for years to come. Negative rates punish banks, Zulauf said.

Today’s social unrest doesn’t surprise Zulauf given the central bank policies which have led to the huge divide between the haves and have-nots. He sees the US as the worst in this regard along with Brazil. The result is “the zeitgeist is turning left.”

Trump is a populist/socialist who speaks to the right wing, according to Zulauf. He believes Joe Biden would work better with the European socialists.

This splintering will lead to more nations being formed in the next twenty years, and even California, with the fifth-largest economy in the world, may break away.

This is an investment scenario like we’ve never seen. Good luck and be careful.",10/30/20 15:58,,0
Economist Raises Alarm Over Inflation,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

The mainstream isn’t worried about inflation. In fact, we’re told inflation is muted.

And that’s true, at least by some measures. We haven’t seen the rising consumer price index (CPI) you might expect as central banks inject trillions of dollars created out of thin air into the economy.

But just because government numbers don’t reflect it – yet – that doesn’t mean there isn’t inflation. In fact, defined correctly, increasing the money supply is inflation. And we certainly have plenty of that.

The fact is inflation is here and it will almost certainly find its way to consumer prices eventually.

Peter Schiff has been saying that we can’t avoid the inflationary impact of money printing forever. During an interview on RT last month, he said that ultimately the price of everything is going up “because the value of the dollar, the money that people are using to buy things is going down. So, everybody is going to need a lot more dollars to buy the stuff that they need.”

In a recent interview with Kitco News, Degussa chief economist Thorsten Polleit agreed with Peter, saying people should be concerned about inflation because it’s a major threat looming on the horizon.

The Federal Reserve was already increasing the money supply before the pandemic, but the response to COVID-19 has put money printing into overdrive. As governments locked down the economy in response to coronavirus, the Fed launched what many have called “QE infinity,” and has increased the money supply at a record pace. But the Federal Reserve isn’t alone. According to a recent IMF report, central banks worldwide have injected $12 trillion into the global economy.

Meanwhile, people are asking “where is the inflation?” Polleit said it’s there. You just have to look for it.

You just have to look at equity markets, real estate and bond prices. At the moment inflation is impacting asset markets. But the increase in the quantity of money that has been printed in the US as well in the Euro area inflation will sooner or later also push up consumer prices. It may take a while for inflation in asset markets to show up in consumer prices, but it will eventually happen.”

Most people reflexively agree that money printing and stimulus are necessary to deal with the economic impacts of the pandemic, but Polleit reminds us that printing money doesn’t create wealth. It merely debases the currency and erodes our purchasing power.

Money is just a means of exchange. The wealth of a nation comes from the products it produces, the apples it grows and the homes that it builds. More money doesn’t make a nation wealthier.”

With the economy mired in a recession, millions out of work and many governments still keeping the clamps on their economies, products aren’t being produced and services aren’t being rendered. “Right now there is very little production so very little wealth is being created,” Polleit said.

But inflation isn’t bad for everybody, at least not in the short-run. Wealthy investors with big portfolios see their wealth grow thanks to asset inflation. The stimulus and money printing have blown up a massive stock market bubble. Real estate prices have also spiked. But your average consumer doesn’t reap the benefits of asset inflation. Instead, they watch their purchasing power erode. As Polleit put it, “Inflation benefits some at the expense of others.”

As the quantity of money rises, it has various effects, but eventually, it will make the great majority of people poorer.”

So, how can we mitigate the pernicious effects of inflation? Polleit said own gold. After all, the yellow metal has thousands of years of history as a store of value.

Holding gold is the best way of getting a risk reduction and return enhancement in your portfolio. Holding gold, especially at current prices, is a wise thing to do.”

Iconic NYC Barbershop Closes After 73 Years in Business Due to Lockdown,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Astor Place Hairstylists is closing down after 73 years of doing business in the East Village.

The iconic hair salon has become the latest victim of both the coronavirus pandemic and the draconian shutdown measures that New York City has had to endure for months.

The shop has counted people like Robert de Niro, Kevin Bacon and Andy Warhol has clients over the years, according to the New York Post. But now, the shop is closing for good just before Thanksgiving.

Michael Saviello, the shop’s manager, told The Post: “We’re down 90% of our business. We’ve been open every day since reopening in June, but we’ve reduced our hours.”

The decision affected 40 stylists that work at the shop, including one named “Big Mike” who has been working at the shop for over 40 years. He said: “A lot of people cried when we told them the news. Some of our customers cried because they came here as kids and now bring their kids to get their hair cut.”

The shop has been owned by the same family for three generations and its message has always been diversity, embracing the idea that people from all different economic backgrounds still need haircuts. A sign near the door informs customers of the many languages the staff speaks.

“Maybe we’ll come back when the city comes back, but right now it’s not feasible,” Saviello concluded.

Unfortunately, for as long as De Blasio stays in office, we’re not sure the city has any chance of “coming back.”",10/27/20 9:55,,0

Keep up to date with our latest:

Anti-lockdown demonstrations intensified around Europe on Saturday night as protesters in Rome hurled Molotov cocktails, bottles and rocks at police and there were also rising tensions in Barcelona and Dresden.

Early Saturday evening in Rome, a sit-in at the famed Campo dei Fiori ended in a clash with police as some in a crowd of a few hundred protesters began throwing bottles and firecrackers, before being dispersed by police with riot gear and truncheons.

Protesters also wielded banners, flares and the Italian flag before clashes with police saw one officer fall to the floor as others charged at demonstrators.

In Barcelona, in Spain, protesters pelted police with rocks and other projectiles in what was a second night of disturbances in Spain’s second-largest city. Small fires also broke out as demonstrators set fire to wooden pallets.

There were also clashes in capital Madrid, along with the northern city of Logroño, where 150 people attacked police with stones, set fire to containers and looted shops, according to officers.

Although not as ill-tempered as elsewhere, there were also protests in the German city of Dresden organised by anti-lockdown group Querdenken 571.

The protests, which were a repeat of similar scenes in the past few days came in the context of new national lockdown measures across Europe in response to rising numbers of coronavirus cases and infections.

“We Are At War”: French Official Warns Country Must Brace For More Islamist Terror Attacks,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

For the second time in October, France has been hit with grisly knife attacks, forcing government officials to warn that more of these terror fueled incidents by “Islamist ideology” are coming.

The latest attack occurred in the French city of Nice on Thursday. Three people were stabbed to death at a church. While an investigation is underway, French President Emmanuel Macron was quick to say the French people are under attack by “Islamist and terrorist madness.”

Thursday’s killings follow the gruesome beheading of schoolteacher Samuel Paty in a northern Paris suburb earlier this month. A Chechen refugee beheaded Paty after he showed his students cartoons of prophet Muhammad in a freedom of expression lesson.

Besides Macron’s warning, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told RTL radio on Friday, quoted by RT News, that the country must be prepared for future attacks as it battles Islamic extremism.

“We are in a war against an enemy that is both inside and outside. We need to understand that there have been and there will be other events such as these terrible attacks,” Darmanin said on RTL radio.

Video: “France is at war. We are at war with an enemy outside and inside. We are at war with the Islamist ideology,” he said on RTL radio.

“The greatness of our democracy, its strength, lies in being able to tell the French that within a legal framework, we can defeat the greatest barbarities. Islamism is a form of 21st-century fascism, extremism that we must fight,” he said on RTL radio.

La grandeur de notre démocratie, sa force, c’est de pouvoir dire aux Français que dans un cadre légal, on peut battre les plus grandes barbaries.

The government raised the terror threat to the highest “emergency” level late this week. Soldiers have been deployed to schools and churches across the country. This also comes as Macron declared a second national lockdown Friday until at least the end of November due to rising coronavirus cases.

UK prime minister Boris Johnson said the Nice incident on Thursday was a “barbaric attack:”

“Our thoughts are with the victims and their families, and the UK stands steadfastly with France against terror and intolerance,” said Johnson.

President Trump said, “America stands with our oldest ally in this fight.” Pope Francis said he prays for the victims, for their families, and for France.

Turkey, which is embroiled in a diplomatic spat with France over the publication of cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, said they “strongly condemn the attack at the church in Nice.”

While 79% of French people believe Islamists have “declared war” on their country, this could drum up support for nationalist political leaders in the country who have had a tough stance on combating Islamic extremism – such as Marine Le Pen.

Responding to the beheading of a school teacher by an Islamist in Paris, French ambassador to Sweden Etienne de Gonneville told broadcaster SVT, “France is a Muslim country.”",10/31/20 11:09,,0
Joe Rogan Debunks Claims He Spread ‘Anti-Vaxxer’ Conspiracy Theories,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Joe Rogan responded to criticism that he was spreading “anti-covid vaccine conspiracy theories” during his podcast with Alex Jones by posting a CBS News clip in which Bill Gates admitted that in one COVID vaccine trial, 80% of participants suffered side-effects.

Following a failed outrage campaign to have Rogan’s podcast with Jones deplatformed altogether, critics then turned to the content itself, accusing Rogan of facilitating dangerous conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines.

Their specific gripe centered on Jones’ claim that a coronavirus vaccine trial left 80% of participants with side-effects.

“I knew people were going to criticize the content of the podcast without even listening and I was right,” said Rogan on his Instagram page.

“That’s why I fact checked every single crazy thing he said, and all of them were verified. People have said he spread “anti-covid vaccine conspiracy theories” because he said that 80% of the people who were given one of the vaccines got sick. Here’s the video of Bill Gates admitting it himself.”

Rogan posted a video of Bill Gates appearing on CBS News, during which the host explained how at least 80% of participants in a coronavirus vaccine trial experienced a “systemic side effect ranging from severe chills to fevers.”

Gates was then asked, “Are these vaccines safe?” to which he countered that the side effects were not “super severe”.

The host then emphasized that “everybody with a high dose had a side effect,” to which Gates responded, “Yeah but some of that is not dramatic, where you know it’s just super painful.”

“Now, I’m NOT anti vaccine, and if a safe and effective covid vaccine is created I’ll take it and encourage others to take it, but I wanted to put this video up to validate what he said,” wrote Rogan.

“He said a lot of crazy, but accurate things, and that’s what I’ve been saying about him for years. He’s most certainly fucked up in the past, but this episode and the subjects he exposed highlight why I chose to have him on.”

Health Expert: Mask Wearing Will Remain Mandatory Even After a COVID Vaccine,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

A top doctor who served as an expert witness for the U.S. Congress says that even after a COVID-19 vaccine is available, mask wearing and other social distancing measures will remain mandatory.

“I feel like there is this perception that once we have a #CoronavirusVaccine life will go back to normal,” tweeted Dr.Krutika Kuppalli.

“Life will not be like it was pre-COVID. Even after we have a #vaccine you will still need to use good hand hygiene, maintain physical distance, avoid crowds and wear masks,” she added.

I feel like there is this perception that once we have a #CoronavirusVaccine life will go back to normal. Life will not be like it was pre-COVID. Even after we have a #vaccine you will still need to use good hand hygiene, maintain physical distance, avoid crowds and wear masks — Dr.Krutika Kuppalli (@KrutikaKuppalli) October 24, 2020

As we have repeatedly highlighted, despite the original lockdown and social distancing rules being introduced on the basis of ‘getting back to normal’, we’re now being told life will never return to normal.

In a CNN article written by their international security editor Nick Paton Walsh, the author asserted that the mandatory wearing of masks will become “permanent,” “just part of life,” and that the public would need to “come to terms with it.”

Earlier this month, a senior U.S. Army official said that there’ll probably never be a return to “normal” post-COVID and that rules such as social distancing and mask wearing will likely become permanent.

Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates also warned that the world won’t return to normal until there is widespread take up of a second coronavirus vaccine and that this could take years.

The idea that life will never return to pre-corona normality is also being pushed by globalist bodies like the World Economic Forum, which has promoted the necessity of exploiting the pandemic to implement a “great reset.”

“Non-essential items being covered up in supermarkets in Wales. Has it really come to this?” asked journalist Grant Tucker.

Why people should be prevented from buying bedding products during a coronavirus lockdown is anyone’s guess, but it’s par for the course given how much society has been deformed thanks to such petty restrictions.

As we previously highlighted, during the first lockdown back in April, a police force in the UK threatened to start searching people’s shopping baskets in order to catch coronavirus lockdown violators.

Northamptonshire Police chief constable Nick Adderley prompted outrage after he appeared in a video to warn people who were buying unessential items at grocery stores that their purchases may be scrutinized by the authorities.

“We will not at this stage be starting to marshal supermarkets and checking the items in baskets and trolleys to see whether it’s a legitimate, necessary item but again be under no illusion, if people do not heed the warnings and the pleas that I’m making today, we will start to do that,” said Adderley.

In the same month, one shopper was fined by police for buying wine and potato chips, which were deemed to be “non-essential” items.

Residents of Wales are currently under a ‘Tier 3’ lockdown, which means people are being urged to stay at home, must not visit other households, while pubs, restaurants, gyms, churches and shops deemed “non-essential” are all closed.

EU Chief Warns Europe Facing “Long Coronavirus Pandemic”,"Looking determinedly into the camera, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a virtual press conference from Belgium — which currently has the highest infection rate in the European Union — that the coronavirus pandemic remains “very serious.”

“We are deeply into the second wave,” said von der Leyen, who is a medical doctor with a background in public health and epidemiology. “And, this time, we face two enemies: the coronavirus and a growing COVID-19 fatigue.” She warned that it would be months at least before the first vaccines were available.

“We cannot let down our guard now,” von der Leyen said. “The situation is very, very serious, but we can slow down the spread of the virus if everyone takes responsibility.” She said that meant “every single one of us, regional and local communities, member states and the European level.”

Von der Leyen also called for better coordination between member states on strategies and measures to curb the spread of the virus, as well as for coordinated quarantine rules. The Commission recommends an EU register of hospital capacity to better organize cross-border patient care. Moreover, though member states have been asked to share COVID-19 data with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, this has not been happening as much as hoped for. The Commission has encouraged member states to agree on standards for travel and contact tracing.

‘Deaths are rising’

The Commission, which is negotiating with pharma companies to purchase hundreds of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines to distribute across the 27 member states of the European Union, has called on EU governments to draw up national vaccination strategies. “There are many issues to be considered for an effective vaccine deployment,” von der Leyen said. “But on one thing I will be very clear,” she added. “We will not compromise on the safety of vaccines.”

The Belgian microbiologist Peter Piot, the former executive director of UNAIDS and one of the scientists who identified Ebola, attended the press conference as a special adviser on COVID-19 to the president of the European Commission. He said 11 vaccines were currently in clinical trials, but he said that there would be no magic elixir.

Piot said it would take a long time before the population achieved sufficient immunity, adding that he was very concerned by polls that suggested that 25% of the EU population might refuse a vaccine. He said he understood that people were suffering from COVID-19 fatigue and were reluctant to follow the guidelines. However, he said, about 60% of people across the EU were wearing masks: Hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved if that rose to 95%.

“Deaths are rising also,” Piot said. “Last week about one-third more deaths than the week before, which means that about 1,000 Europeans die per day from COVID.”

Piot, who contracted the coronavirus at the beginning of the pandemic and suffered from complete exhaustion for months, said he knew what he was talking about. He said he was more optimistic now that that hospital treatment seems to be more effective than it had been at the beginning of the pandemic.

Tough times ahead

At a video summit hosted by European Council President Charles Michel on Thursday, EU heads of state and government will discuss the current situation. Michel said the European Union should conduct more rapid testing for travelers, careworkers and elderly people in care homes. The European Commission has put aside €100 million ($117.5 million) to buy rapid tests, and Michel has said member states should not have to compete for access.

Von der Leyen seemed a little perturbed by a question about why the European Union’s strategy so far had not succeeded. But then she admitted that perhaps member states had been “too fast” to ease certain measures in the summer that had been put in place to curb the spread of the virus. She also pointed out that though hospitals were better equipped than in spring, medical staff were “exhausted,” and it was no surprise that Europe was now witnessing a second wave, which might not even be the last.

The European Commission president concluded on a somber note, saying the cancellation of holiday markets, restricted travel and limited socializing would make for a tough winter. “

“I think this year’s Christmas will be a different Christmas,” von der Leyen said.",10/29/20 7:27,,0
"UK Police Chief Warns Lockdown Could Spark Riots, Civil Unrest","Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

A police chief in the UK has warned that lockdown is a “time bomb” that could eventually explode into riots and mass civil unrest.

The United Kingdom has placed its citizens under different ‘tiers’ of lockdowns depending where they are in the country, although anecdotal evidence suggests there is now mass non-compliance with the rules.

This could force authorities to become more draconian in enforcing the measures, which could in turn spark a violent backlash.

According to West Midlands commissioner David Jamieson, “We’re sitting on a time bomb here.”

“We’re getting very near the stage where you could see a considerable explosion of frustration and energy,” he added.

“Things are very on the edge in a lot of communities and it wouldn’t take very much to spark off unrest, riots, damage,” warned Jamieson.

The comments were made off the back of another warning – that people who violated the rules by organizing family Christmas gatherings could see their celebrations broken up by police.

The West Midlands is currently under a Tier 2 lockdown, which means that it’s illegal for two separate households to mix indoors, ruining Christmas for many families or at least those who choose to abide by the rules.

The prospect of video footage showing police officers entering homes to break up Christmas family gatherings is only likely to turn the public further against the lockdown, which was introduced under the guise of “getting back to normal” but has now become the new normal.

Whitmer Orders Restaurants Take Names of Customers For Contact Tracing Or Face Fines & Jail Time,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer’s administration has set forth new tyrannical coronavirus mitigation orders requiring restaurants and bars take down names of its customers “to aid in contact tracing and case investigation efforts.”

Michigan Department of Health and Human Services unveiled the order last week, stating that the new mandate would take effect on Monday.

“All dine-in food service establishments must maintain accurate records of the names and phone numbers of patrons who purchase food for consumption on the premises, and the date and time of entry,” the order reads.

Failure to follow these new orders is punishable by a fine of up to $1000 and up to six months in jail.

“While continuing to focus on encouraging voluntary compliance with its Emergency Orders, MDHHS has also issued rules that set forth fines for violations of these epidemic orders. Violations are punishable by a civil fine up to $1,000 and may also be treated as a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than six months or a fine of not more than $200, or both,” the order states.

Additionally, the department’s new orders also reduce the maximum gathering size for indoor gatherings, such as weddings, parties and banquets from from 500 people to 50 people — just in time for Thanksgiving.

Though the daily death rate has remained low since June, Whiter is using the increase in general cases as the pretext to implement this tyrannical contact tracing agenda.

Notably, the ACLU had stated in May that government contact tracing schemes are a risk “to people’s fundamental rights to privacy and association.”

This over-the-top government order is par for the course for Whitmer and Michigan.

Last month, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that Whitmer’s draconian lockdown orders were unconstitutional.

“The liberties protected by the Constitution are not fair-weather freedoms — in place when times are good but able to be cast aside in times of trouble,” U.S. District Judge William Stickman wrote.

Whitmer’s administration is encouraging residents to report such violations of this order and report non-mask wearers to police.

"Fauci Praises Biden, Knocks Trump Over Coronavirus Approach — WH Slams For “Playing Politics”","Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci praised Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden and criticized President Trump over their coronavirus response plans just days before the election.

Fauci told The Washington Post on Friday that America will experience “a lot of hurt” in the coming winter months due to a second wave of the pandemic.

“We’re in for a whole lot of hurt. It’s not a good situation,” Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said. “All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.”

But Fauci went on to suggest that Trump is to blame for a coming second wave and that Biden is “taking it seriously.”

From The Washington Post:

Asked about the difference between their approaches, Fauci said Biden’s campaign “is taking it seriously from a public health perspective.” Trump, Fauci said, is “looking at it from a different perspective.” He said that perspective was “the economy and reopening the country.”

The White House hit back at Fauci’s political grandstanding, saying that Fauci “making his political leanings known” just days before the election is indicative of “Swamp” behavior.

“It’s unacceptable and breaking with all norms for Dr. Fauci, a senior member of the President’s Coronavirus Task Force and someone who has praised President Trump’s actions throughout this pandemic, to choose three days before an election to play politics,” said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere.

“As a member of the Task Force, Dr. Fauci has a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy, but he’s not done that, instead choosing to criticize the President in the media and make his political leanings known by praising the President’s opponent — exactly what the American people have come to expect from The Swamp.”

“Dr. Fauci may have just admitted that he is afraid the cure will be worse than the disease and that unlike the president he has no confidence in the American people to make the best choice for themselves armed with CDC best practices,” Deere concluded

Operation Coronavirus Is Working Hand-in-Hand With The Nanotech Agenda,"Reddit Email WhatsApp More 20 Shares

The nanotech agenda – involving the placement of tiny sensors, devices and machines measured in nanometers inside the human body – is receiving a boost from the current fake pandemic which I have labeled Operation Coronavirus.

My earlier article Hydrogel Biosensor: Implantable Nanotech to be Used in COVID Vaccines? discussed the possibility that the coming COVID vaccines may incorporate nanotechnology funded by DARPA called hydrogel, a biosensor which would monitor your body as well as send and receive information to the 5G Smart Grid.

However there is much, much more to the story.

The NWO conspirators have not only been planning this scamdemic for decades but also have been planning the nanotech agenda for a long time too; now, with the advent of COVID, the two agendas are merging, with sinister implications for humanity.

This article will take a closer look at the nanotech agenda and the current state of nanotechnology inside existing products such as vaccines. The agenda is already far more advanced than many people realize.

2008 Paper Outlines Plan To Construct A Nanorobot Hardware Architecture

A 2008 research paper entitled Nanorobot Hardware Architecture for Medical Defense analyzes in fine detail how nanotech devices such as nanorobots could be used to for various purposes such as “medical defense” and “epidemic control.”

It states that it provides details on an “integrated platform and hardware architecture for nanorobots application in epidemic control, which should enable real time in vivo prognosis of biohazard infection.”

The idea is to place nanotech inside our bodies which communicates in real time with the Smart Grid (powered by 5G) to provide intimate information to the authorities about us. Wayne from Alchemical Tech Revolution does a great commentary here. Following are some quotes from the paper:

“Normally, for areas in public calamity or conflict zones, the absence of drinking water, any sort of fuel, electricity, and the lack of towers for network communication, including cable and wireless telephony, is a constant.

“In such a situation, the available infrastructure is far from ideal to enable a large scale medical laboratory with precise and fast analysis. For such aspect, nanorobots integrated with nanobiosensors can help to transmit real time information, using international mobile phones for wireless data transmission through satellite communication.

“In fact, nanorobots should mean an efficient and powerful clinical device to provide precious biomedical monitoring, both for soldiers as for civilian population.”

Notice how they admit that there is dual use (for military and civilians) which usually connotes a weapons system with another use. In this case, they are disguising the deeper purpose (embedded surveillance) with the superficial purpose (a medical application):

“Taking from the moment of infection, some contagious diseases may show the first symptoms after hours, a week, or longer time, like years or even decades. It means, for example, that when the public authorities noticed the infection from a contaminated person, showing external symptoms, a virus had enough time to spread itself through a circle of friends and workmates of the infected victim.

“Meantime, those mates were adversely driving the virus forward, and had started a catastrophic chain circle. The use of nanorobots with embedded nanodevices for real time epidemic control, as lab on a chip, can be useful to avoid serious contamination with large proportions.”

The above quote hypes the danger of contagion, and specifically a virus, as a reason for you to willingly submit to the nanotech agenda and get embedded with nanotechnology.

It appeals to the concepts of contagion and germ theory, however especially since the COVID scamdemic began, a number of brave independent researchers and doctors are questioning these ideas, which reinforce the current Medical Industry’s business model of petrochemical pills and vaccines.

“We implemented a system simulation and architecture of nanorobots for sensing the bloodstream, targeting biochemical changes against pathological signals.

“Actual advances in wireless technologies, nanoelectronics devices, and their use in the implementation of nanorobots applied to epidemic control, illustrate what upcoming technologies can enable in terms of real time health monitoring. The approach for in vivo monitoring chemical concentrations should also apply to other.”

As Wayne says, this stuff is next level contact tracing. Forget an app on your phone; the plan is for in vivo (taking place in a living organism) surveillance. There are many significant quotes from the paper, but here is one last one:

“Frequencies ranging from 1 to 20MHz can be successfully used for biomedical applications without any damage.”

Is the implication that there could be damage if frequencies are higher than 20MHz, such as in the 30-100 GHz range of 5G?

2017 Study Shows Nanotech Contaminants Already Widely Present In Vaccines

The nanotech invasion is already here. It’s not a question of “will they place nanotech in vaccines” since they already have.

This 2017 Italian study entitled New Quality-Control Investigations on Vaccines: Micro- and Nanocontamination details an astonishing array of nanocontaminants in vaccines, including particles made of lead, cadmium, cerium, iron, titanium, nickel, zirconium, hafnium, strontium, tungsten, gold, silver, platinum, antimony, bismuth and aluminum.

The study (which analyzes 44 types of 15 traditional vaccines) states that these contaminants are “non biodegradable and non biocompatible”, that their inclusion is “not declared” and that their presence is “inexplicable.”

It gives the benefit of the doubt to Big Pharma and its controllers when it concludes that “our hypothesis is that this contamination is unintentional, since it is probably due to polluted components or procedures of industrial processes (e.g. filtrations) used to produce vaccines, not investigated and not detected by the Producers. If our hypothesis is actually the case, a close inspection of the working places and the full knowledge of the whole procedure of vaccine preparation would probably allow to eliminate the problem.”

Knowing the background of the human microchipping and nanotech agenda, I would suggest there is another way to see things.

The study reveals how these nanoparticles can interact with the body in negative ways and cause harmful effects:

“… investigations revealed that some particles are embedded in a biological substrate, probably proteins, endo-toxins and residues of bacteria. As soon as a particle comes in contact with proteic fluids, a nano-bio-interaction occurs and a “protein corona” is formed.

“The nano-bio-interaction generates a bigger-sized compound that is not biodegradable and can induce adverse effects, since it is not recognized as self by the body. Figure 5a-5f show examples of these nano-bio-interactions. Aggregates can be seen (stable composite entities) containing particles of Lead in Meningitec, of stainless steel (Iron, Chromium and Nickel) and of Copper, Zinc and Lead in Cervarix.”

“After being injected, those microparticles, nanoparticles and aggregates can stay around the injection site forming swellings and granulomas … But they can also be carried by the blood circulation, escaping any attempt to guess what will be their final destination … As happens with all foreign bodies, particularly that small, they induce an inflammatory reaction that is chronic because most of those particles cannot be degraded.

“Furthermore, the protein-corona effect … due to a nano-bio-interaction … can produce organic/inorganic composite particles capable of stimulating the immune system in an undesirable way … It is impossible not to add that particles the size often observed in vaccines can enter cell nuclei and interact with the DNA …”

“In some cases, e.g. as occurs with Iron and some Iron alloys, they can corrode and the corrosion products exert a toxicity affecting the tissues …”

So here is the question to ponder: are these so-called accidental and dangerous nanocontaminants just particles that deleteriously affect human health in numerous ways, or are they also nanosensors that can receive and transmit data to the Smart Grid?

Nanotechnology Is At The Forefront Of Cutting-Edge Vaccine Research

The nanotech agenda is closely connected to vaccines. For example, this 2019 study Nanoparticle-Based Vaccines Against Respiratory Viruses touts the advantages of nanotech vaccines:

“Conventional vaccines based on live-attenuated pathogens present a risk of reversion to pathogenic virulence while inactivated pathogen vaccines often lead to a weak immune response. Subunit vaccines were developed to overcome these issues.

“However, these vaccines may suffer from a limited immunogenicity and, in most cases, the protection induced is only partial. A new generation of vaccines based on nanoparticles has shown great potential to address most of the limitations of conventional and subunit vaccines.

“This is due to recent advances in chemical and biological engineering, which allow the design of nanoparticles with a precise control over the size, shape, functionality and surface properties, leading to enhanced antigen presentation and strong immunogenicity.”

This July 2020 study COVID-19 vaccine development and a potential nanomaterial path forward explains how there are many nanotech platforms that will be included in future vaccines:

“Nanotechnology-based approaches offer enabling solutions to the delivery challenge by trafficking the vaccine to appropriate cellular populations and subcellular locations …

“Moderna’s mRNA vaccine is based on a lipid nanoparticle platform, but there are many other emerging nanotechnologies for delivery of nucleic acid vaccines … Nanotechnology platforms including cationic nanoemulsions, liposomes, dendrimers or polysaccharide particles have been employed for improving the stability and delivery of mRNA based vaccines.”

The coming Moderna COVID vaccine funded by NWO frontman and eugenics Bill Gates is a new type of technology: an mRNA vaccine that uses nanotechnology. This goes for other COVID vaccines that are being developed.

The COVID plandemic is being used as a pretext to rush forward even faster with nanotech vaccines, which ultimately accelerates the central NWO (New World Order) scheme: the human microchipping agenda. The nanotech agenda via COVID is on full display:

“Nanomaterials play an important role in all aspects of vaccine design, delivery and administration. Nanoparticles enable multivalent antigen presentation and stabilization of antigens upon administration, they can serve as adjuvants to boost the immune response, and they can act as carriers for the targeted delivery of antigens.

“Indeed, an mRNA vaccine delivered by a liposomal nanoparticle is amongst the candidates currently in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2. While it remains a fact that no mRNA or DNA vaccine is currently approved for any disease, the delivery of nucleic acids requires some form of modification or a nanodevice to prevent degradation in the body, and liposomal devices have indeed already been approved for RNA delivery, albeit not yet for vaccines.”

Final Thoughts On The Accelerating Nanotech Agenda

This is it! It’s game on! All the things that many alternative researchers have been writing, talking and warning about for years are arriving. Operation Coronavirus is the gateway to bring in the New World Order. COVID has been the excuse offered by tyrants for just about every draconian restriction under the sun.

Now, with the coming COVID vaccine, we know it will include some kind of nanotechnology, since as I have outlined above, there are a plethora of nanotechnology platforms being developed in addition to things like hydrogel. Various studies and the pharmaceutical companies themselves are openly stating that there will be nanotech COVID vaccines.

With plans to make this vaccine widepsread, administed by the military (as admitted in both the US and the UK) and “as mandatory as possible” (according to Aussie PM Scott Morrison), time is running out for people to wake up to the nanotech agenda – before it’s too late.

The Global Takeover Is Underway,"Reddit Email WhatsApp More 86 Shares

The World Economic Forum public relations video above, “8 Predictions for the World in 2030,” short as it may be, offers a telling glimpse into what the technocratic elite has in store for the rest of us. This includes:

“You’ll own nothing” — And “you’ll be happy about it.” Instead, you’ll rent everything you need, and it’ll be delivered by drone right to your door. “The U.S. won’t be the world’s leading superpower” — Instead, a handful of countries will dominate together. “You won’t die waiting for an organ donor” — Rather than transplanting organs from deceased donors, custom organs will be 3D printed on demand. “You’ll eat much less meat” — Meat will be “an occasional treat, not a staple, for the good of the environment and our health.”As detailed in many previous articles, this is a foolhardy idea, not just for health reasons but also environmental ones. Integrating livestock is a foundational aspect of successful regenerative farming that can solve both food shortages and environmental concerns at the same time. “A billion people will be displaced by climate change” — As a result, countries will have to prepare to welcome more refugees. “Polluters will have to pay to emit carbon dioxide” — To eliminate fossil fuels, there will be a global price on carbon. Vandana Shiva, Ph.D., discussed this in a recent interview. Rather than promoting organic and regenerative farming, the technocratic elite are pushing something called zero-budget natural farming. Bill Gates is part of this scheme.As explained by Shiva, the wholly unnatural setup works something like this: The state takes out large loans, which are then divvied out to farmers to grow food for free. The farmers make their money not by selling their crops, but by trading their soil carbon rate on the global market.Basically, carbon is being turned into a tradeable commodity, replacing the actual farm output of grains and other crops. Farmers with higher carbon in their soil will make more money than those with carbon-poor soil. Meanwhile, they’ll make nothing from the crops they grow. “You could be preparing to go to Mars” — Scientists “will have worked out how to keep you healthy in space,” thus opening up the possibility of becoming a space-faring race and colonizing other planets. “Western values will have been tested to the breaking point.”

Pandemics Are a Tool of Social Control

For decades, war and the threat of war has enriched the technocratic elite and kept the population going along with their agenda. War and physical attacks have been repeatedly used to foist ever more draconian restrictions upon us and remove our liberties. The Patriot Act, rammed through in the aftermath of 9/11, is just one egregious example.

Today, pandemics and the threat of infectious outbreaks are the new tools of war and social control. For years, Gates has prepared the global psyche for a new enemy: deadly, invisible viruses that can crop up at any time.1,2 And the only way to protect ourselves is by giving up old-fashioned notions of privacy, liberty and personal decision-making.

We need to maintain our distance from others, including family members. We need to wear masks, even in our own homes and during sex. We need to close down small businesses and work from home. We need to vaccinate the entire global population and put stringent travel restrictions into place to prevent the potential for spread.

We must track and trace everyone, every moment of the day and night, and install biometric readers into everyone’s bodies to identify who the potential risk-carriers are. Infected people are the new threat. This is what the technocratic elite wants you to believe, and they’ve succeeded to convince a shocking ratio of the global population of this in just a few short months.

If you’re unfamiliar with the term “technocracy,” be sure to go back and listen to my interview with Patrick Wood, author of “Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation” and “Technocracy: The Hard Road to World Order.”

A New Digital Currency System Underway

Two of the last pieces of the totalitarian takeover will be the transition to an all-digital currency linked to digital IDs. With that, enforcement of social rules will be more or less ensured, as your finances, indeed your entire identity, can easily be held hostage if you fail to comply.

Just think how easy it would be to automate it such that if you fail to get your mandated vaccine, or post something undesirable on the internet, your bank account becomes unavailable or your biometric ID won’t allow you entry into your office building.

An August 13, 2020, article3 on the Federal Reserve website discusses the supposed benefits of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). There’s general agreement among experts that most major countries will implement CBDC within the next two to four years.

An all-digital currency system also plays into social engineering, as it can be used to incentivize desired behaviors, very similar to what China is doing with their social credit system. For example, you might get a certain amount of digital currency but you have to buy a certain item or perform a particular task within a certain timeframe.

Many uninformed people will believe that these new CBDCs will be very similar to existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but they would be seriously mistaken. Bitcoin is decentralized and a rational strategy to opt out of the existing central bank controlled system, while these CBDCs will be centralized and completely controlled by the central banks.

If you have been intrigued about investing in Bitcoin as a safer alternative to the stock market, but just didn’t know how or understand the process, the video below is an excellent introduction on how to do this safely without losing your funds. My favorite crypto exchange is Kraken, which has far lower fees than Coinbase.

The Globalists

While I mention Gates a lot, he’s not acting alone, of course. It just so happens that as you trace the connections between the decision-makers of the world, you’ll find him in an astonishing number of places.

For example, In October 2019, Gates co-hosted a pandemic preparedness simulation for a “novel coronavirus,” known as Event 201, along with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the World Economic Forum.

The event eerily predicted what would happen just 10 weeks later, when COVID-19 appeared. Gates and the World Economic Forum, in turn, are both partnered4 with the United Nations which, while keeping a relatively low profile, appears to be at the heart of the globalist takeover agenda.

Gates is also the largest funder of the World Health Organization — the medical branch of the U.N., while the World Economic Forum is the social and economic branch of the U.N. Other key partners that play important roles in the implementation of the globalists agenda include:5

Foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Ford Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, the UN Foundation and George Soros’ Open Society Foundation Avanti Communications, a British provider of satellite technology with global connectivity 2030 Vision, a partnership of technology giants to provide the infrastructure and technology solutions needed to realize the U.N.’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. 2030 Vision is also partnered with Frontier 2030, which is a partnership of organizations under the helm of the World Economic Forum Google, the No. 1 Big Data collector in the world and a leader in AI services Mastercard, which is leading the globalist charge to develop digital IDs and banking services Salesforce, a global leader in cloud computing, the “internet of things” and artificial intelligence. Incidentally, Salesforce is led by Marc Benioff, who is also on the World Economic Forum’s board of directors

The Fourth Industrial Revolution Is the Technocratic Agenda

In decades past, the technocrats, the global, mostly unelected, elite that steer the management of nations worldwide, called for a “new world order.” Today, the NWO has been largely replaced with terms like “the Great Reset,”6 “the Fourth Industrial Revolution,”7 and the slogan “Build Back Better.”8

All of these terms and slogans refer to the same long-term globalist agenda to dismantle democracy and national borders in favor of a global governance by unelected leaders, and the reliance on technological surveillance rather than the rule of law to maintain public order.

As expressed by Matt Hancock, the British Minister for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, during a speech before the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Fourth Industrial Revolution in 2017:9

“One of the roles of Parliament is to cast ahead, to look to the horizon, and tackle the great challenges of our time. So, I applaud the creation of the APPG on the fourth industrial revolution, which surely is one of the greatest challenges we face, as a nation, and as a world.

The nature of the technologies is materially different to what has come before. In the past, we’ve thought of consumption as a one-off, and capital investment as additive. Yet put resources into the networks that now connect half the world, or into AI, and the effects are exponential …

I’m delighted to speak alongside so many impressive colleagues who really understand this, and alongside Professor Klaus Schwab who literally ‘wrote the book’ on the 4th Industrial Revolution. Your work, bringing together as you do all the best minds on the planet, has informed what we are doing …

Our Digital Strategy, embedded within the wider Industrial Strategy, sets out the seven pillars on which we can build our success. And inside that fits our 5G strategy, like a set of Russian Dolls.

Our Strategy covers infrastructure, skills, rules and ethics of big data use, cyber security, supporting the tech sector, the digitization of industry, and digitization of government.”

The Great Reset — A Techno-Fascist Recipe

If you listened to my interview with Wood, you will recognize the technocratic elements of Hancock’s speech: the focus on technology — in particular artificial intelligence, digital surveillance and Big Data collection (which is what 5G is for) — and the digitization of industry (which includes banking) and government, which in turn allows for the automation of social engineering and social rule (although that part is never expressly stated).

“The promised Utopia comes with a price — it sets shackles on our personal freedom.”

Then there’s the direct reference to professor Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum. Schwab is also highlighted in the June 29, 2020, Technocracy.news article,10 “The Elite Technocrats Behind the Global ‘Great Reset,” which reads, in part:11

“The UN Agenda 2030 with its Sustainable Development Goals is claimed to ‘ensure peace and prosperity for people and the planet.’ The actions are said to tackle poverty and hunger, bring better health and education, reduce inequalities, and save the oceans, forests and the climate.

Who can argue against such benevolent goals? But the promised Utopia comes with a price — it sets shackles on our personal freedom …

The leading partners of the United Nations Global Goals project reveal the real technocratic agenda that lies behind the polished feel-good façade — it involves a plan to fully integrate mankind into a technological surveillance apparatus overseen by a powerful AI.

The current pandemic scare has been a perfect trigger to kickstart this nefarious agenda … The current COVID-19 crisis is seen by the World Economic Forum and its chairman Klaus Schwab as the perfect trigger to implement their grandiose technocratic plan. Big Tech will come to ‘rescue’ the world.

In June 2020, Schwab declared … the need of a Great Reset to restore order in a world steeped in panic, conflict and economic turmoil:

‘The COVID-19 crisis has shown us that our old systems are not fit anymore for the 21st century. It has laid bare the fundamental lack of social cohesion, fairness, inclusion and equality. Now is the historical moment in time, not only to fight the real virus but to shape the system for the needs of the Post-Corona era.

We have a choice to remain passive, which would lead to the amplification of many of the trends we see today. Polarization, nationalism, racism, and ultimately increasing social unrest and conflicts.

But we have another choice, we can build a new social contract, particularly integrating the next generation, we can change our behavior to be in harmony with nature again, and we can make sure the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are best utilized to provide us with better lives.’

This techno-fascist recipe will then, in an utmost non-democratic fashion without any public debate or skeptic inquiry, soon be integrated into the agenda of G20 and the European Union — relabeled as the Great Green Deal …

Unsurprisingly, Klaus Schwab fails to mention his own and his cronies’ role in creating this global economic mess in the first place — as it was ‘foreseen’ with stunning accuracy in World Economic Forum’s and Bill Gate’s Event 201 (October 2019) and in the Rockefeller Foundation report12 Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development (2010).”

UN Calls for Nations to ‘Build Back Better’

The U.N.’s central role in the technocratic agenda is hard to miss once you start looking. As reported by the U.N.’s Department of Global Communications April 22, 2020, in an article about climate change and COVID-19:13

“As the world begins planning for a post-pandemic recovery, the United Nations is calling on Governments to seize the opportunity to ‘build back better’ by creating more sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies …

‘With this restart, a window of hope and opportunity opens… an opportunity for nations to green their recovery packages and shape the 21st century economy in ways that are clean, green, healthy, safe and more resilient,’ said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa in her International Mother Earth Day message … It is therefore important that post-COVID-19 stimulus packages help the economy ‘grow back greener’ …

As Governments approve stimulus packages to support job creation, poverty reduction and economic growth, UNEP will help Member States ‘build back better,’ and capture opportunities for leap-frogging to green investments in renewable energy, smart housing, green public procurement and public transport — all guided by the principles and standards of sustainable production and consumption. These actions will be critical to fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals.”

Here too, we see the technocratic agenda shining through. As described by Wood (see interview hyperlinked above), technocracy is an economic system based on the allocation of energy resources, which necessitates social engineering to control the population and the technological infrastructure to automate this control.

Rather than being driven by supply and demand and free enterprise, this system is one in which companies are told what resources they’re allowed to use, when, and for what, and consumers are told what they are allowed to buy — or rather, rent, judging by the World Economic Forum video above.

If you need something, you’ll be allowed to rent it. You probably won’t even own the clothes on your back. Everything will be “fair” and “equitable.” There will be no need for hard work, ingenuity or higher-than-average intelligence. Everyone will be the same — with the exception of the technocrats themselves, of course. And in true social engineering fashion, they tell us we will be “happy” in our 24/7 enslavement to boot.

The Encroaching Dystopia

It’s important to realize that one way by which this globalist plan is being pushed forward is through the creation of new global laws. Gates already wields powerful influence over global food and agriculture policy, in addition to his influence over global health and technology (including banking and digital IDs).

The Great Reset, or the “build back better” plan, specifically calls for all nations to implement “green” regulations as part of the post-COVID recovery effort. It sounds like a worthwhile endeavor — after all, who doesn’t want to protect the environment?

But the end goal is far from what the typical person envisions when they hear these plans. The end goal is to turn us into serfs without rights to privacy, private ownership or anything else.

To get an idea of just how dystopian a future we might be looking at, consider Microsoft’s international patent14 WO/2020/060606 for a “cryptocurrency system using body activity data.” The international patent was filed June 20, 2019. The U.S. patent office application,15 16128518, was filed September 21, 2018. As explained in the abstract:16

“Human body activity associated with a task provided to a user may be used in a mining process of a cryptocurrency system. A server may provide a task to a device of a user which is communicatively coupled to the server. A sensor communicatively coupled to or comprised in the device of the user may sense body activity of the user.

Body activity data may be generated based on the sensed body activity of the user. The cryptocurrency system communicatively coupled to the device of the user may verify if the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.”

The U.S. patent application includes the following flow chart summary of the process:17

This patent, if implemented, would essentially turn human beings into robots. If you’ve ever wondered how the average person will make a living in the AI tech-driven world of the future, this may be part of your answer.

People will be brought down to the level of mindless drones, spending their days carrying out tasks automatically handed out by, say a cellphone app, in return for a cryptocurrency “award.” I don’t know about you, but I can think of better, more enjoyable ways to spend my time here on Earth.

The World Economic Forum — A Trojan Horse

I’ve mentioned the World Economic Forum multiple times already in this article, and it, along with the U.N., is at the heart of the global takeover agenda. As noted in the Canadian Truth blog post,18 “World Economic Forum Wheel of Evil”:

“ … this is about two things, the implementation of the UN SDG’s [Sustainable Development Goals] and the WEF [World Economic Forum] Fourth Industrial Revolution. End game: total Technocratic lock-down where they control every aspect of our lives and all resources on the planet.”

The blog post includes the following illustration, created and released by the World Economic Forum, showing the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global response to it. If you go to the original site for the illustration,19 you’ll also find listings of publications, videos and data relating to all of these facets.

In short, the pandemic is being used to destroy the local economies around the world, which will then allow the World Economic Forum to come in and “rescue” debt-ridden countries.

As mentioned earlier, the price for this salvation is your liberty. The World Economic Forum will, through its financial bailouts, be able to effectively control most countries in the world. And, again, one of the aspects of the technocratic plan is to eliminate nation borders and nationalism in general.

COVID — Symptoms of Power

There’s a lot more that could be said on this, but I’ve already covered many of the different aspects of the globalists agenda in other articles, including “COVID Symptoms of Power: Tech Billionaires Harvest Humanity,” “Tech Billionaires Aiming at a Global Currency,” “Harvard Professor Exposes Surveillance Capitalism,” “How Medical Technocracy Made the Plandemic Possible” and “US Surveillance Bill 6666: The Devil in the Details.”

None of it is pleasant reading, but it’s important to understand where we’re headed. We no longer have the luxury of sticking our heads in the sand and waiting for the bad news to pass.

The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically widened the economic gap between average people and the wealthy elite, with billionaires raking in trillions of dollars in mere months.20,21 Without the competition from small businesses, large multinational companies have been allowed to gobble up business, expanding both their wealth and their influence, while extreme poverty has risen for the first time in two decades.22

If you think the Great Reset and the Green New Deal are going to even out this financial disparity and turn the world into an equitable Utopia, you’re bound to be disappointed. The globalist plan isn’t about creating a better world for the average person. Microsoft’s patent illustrates what the plan heralds for us.

Medical Tyranny Will Get Worse if We Let It

The medical tyranny and censorship of anti-groupthink that has emerged full-force during this pandemic are also part and parcel of the Great Reset. After all, if they won’t allow you to own anything, and they want to put biosensors into your body to turn you into a cryptocurrency mining minion, do you really think they’re going to let you make medical decisions for yourself?

Over the past several months, Gates has made the media rounds discussing the need to silence dissenting views and information about the virus, it’s treatment and the vaccines being made.

According to a survey cited by RT,23 less than half of all Americans now say they would not take the COVID-19 vaccine even if they were paid $100 to do it. There are good reasons for this hesitancy, as trials are starting to reveal serious side effects.

For Gates, who is funding no fewer than six different COVID-19 vaccines, this is no small problem. In an October 2020 interview, Gates urged American health officials to start “thinking about which voices will help reduce the hesitancy, so we can get a level of vaccination that really has a chance of stopping” the pandemic.24

Despite the risks associated with these novel mRNA vaccines, which have never before been approved for human use, and despite the fact that children and adolescents have a minuscule risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19, vaccine proponents like Dr. Paul Offit are now calling for children to be added to the COVID-19 trials.25 Hopefully, the number of parents willing to offer up their children as guinea pigs will be few.

In closing, keep in mind that technocracy is inherently a technological society run through social engineering. This is why there’s such a strong focus on “science.” Anytime someone dissents, they’re therefore accused of being “anti-science,” and any science that conflicts with the status quo is declared “debunked science.”

The only science that matters is whatever the technocrats deem true. Logic, however, will tell you that this cannot be so. Science is never settled. Science is never one-sided. Science can be wrong. Getting to the truth demands that an issue be looked at from many different angles.

Over the past year in particular, scientific inquiry and inquisitiveness has been censored and stifled to an astonishing degree. If we allow it to continue, the end result will be devastating.

We must keep pushing for transparency and truth. We must insist on medical freedom and personal liberty. Do not allow yourself to be bullied into silence by those who counter your objections with “anti-science” or “conspiracy-theory” slurs. The future of mankind is at stake. Be brave. Resist tyranny.

COVID-19 Roadmap: 12 Step Plan To Create A Totalitarian New World Order,"Reddit Email WhatsApp More 124 Shares

One can step back from all the MK Ultra mind control through the propaganda of the mainstream media and lying politicians and clearly see that the CON-vid hysteria is the invisible enemy tyrants are using to push forward both the United Nations ‘Agenda 21‘ and advance toward Agenda 2030.

Below is an infographic that provides the 12 step plan of using a virtually unproven “virus” to bring about the New World Order and it’s right on schedule unless the people stop it.

Currently, we are on step 8 and moving quickly towards step 9:

After step 9, all bets are off because by that time, most small businesses will be out of business due to unlawful lockdowns and the only businesses open with be giant online corporations who are making a killing from the lockdown even now.

Already we are told there are “coin shortage” and many stores are demanding payments be card rather then cash unless you have the correct amount.

Seriously, the above roadmap seems to be right on track with what we are seeing advance our way.

It’s time the people awake from their slumber, turn off the television, quit believing the narrative of the “right/left” paradigm and start shutting down tyrants and defending liberty!

"5G Rollout Speeds Up Despite Pandemic, Governments Banning It Issuing Moratoriums & Lawsuits","Reddit Email WhatsApp More 948 Shares

Many cities, countries, and organizations have taken action against the 5G rollout including banning it, filing lawsuits and issuing moratoriums. Since 2018 people and animals have been getting sick where it has been turned on.

Worldwide opposition includes a multitude of catastrophic warnings in addition to health risks from exposure which include reduced immunity to illness and cancer.

Even though the coronavirus pandemic has literally caused countries to shut themselves down – this hasn’t stopped the “Race to 5G”. In fact – the pandemic is actually accelerating it.

Thanks to Technocracy News & Trends for providing explanation why:

5G carriers claim that the coronavirus pandemic has actually increased demand for wireless bandwidth and thus make it ever more important to quickly rollout 5G towers around the nation to increase wireless capacity. – TN Editor

In March 2020 everything that could be moved online already has, from elementary schools to college classes, from entire company workforces to shareholder meetings. Whole cities have emptied under the coronavirus threat as businesses tell employees to work from home, students are sent indoors to learn online and every type of entertainment — from restaurants and sporting venues to movie theaters — shutters, forcing people to stay home and rely on their home broadband networks to interact with the outside world.

Small mobile antenna on concrete pole.

This switch-over is unprecedented, which begs the question: Can our current networks handle the strain?

Moreover, is the coronavirus outbreak and the “social distancing″ required to mitigate the spread going to become the business case for more advanced and robust 5G technologies for a future in which business, health care and human interaction must be at more than an arm’s length?

Read full story here…

In February 2019 the telecom industry admitted that they don’t even have scientific evidence that 5G is safe. Yet many of the powers-that-be still insist that humanity desperately needs this technology. So this desperate need even includes launching satellites to blast it from space. Wack-a-doodle doo.

Entire Baltimore Neighborhood Under Lockdown: “Police Declared Martial Law”,"Reddit Email WhatsApp More 212 Shares

Five days ago, Detective Sean Suiter, a married father of five and an 18-year veteran with the Baltimore Police, was patrolling the streets of West Baltimore around 5pm last Wednesday when he saw suspicious activity. Suiter approached a man and was shot point blank in the head, in a summary execution. He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition where he later died of his injuries.

Rest In Peace Detective Sean Suiter https://t.co/NiKIdmzbAD pic.twitter.com/l7vkrOKjMv — Baltimore Police (@BaltimorePolice) November 16, 2017

In response, Baltimore Police reacted with “fire and fury” turning the neighborhood where Suiter was shot into an “open-air prison,” shutting down city streets and enabling checkpoints for citizens while officers in tactical gear went door to door, according to Baltimore Brew. Residents were prohibited from entering their own neighborhood unless they showed proper identification, these extreme measures have been in place for 4-5 days.

“They’ve been to my house three times asking, ‘Did you hear anything? Do you know anything,’” said Edward Stanley, a local resident, who had to show a yellow slip before entering the neighborhood.

Baltimore Brew said, the neighborhood was tuned into “open-air prison,” as the complete lockdown was in attempt to collect evidence and search for the shooter.

Police initially said they needed to cordon off the area to try to capture the shooter. Police have said Suiter was in the 900 block of Bennett Place, investigating a previous homicide, when he was shot on Wednesday. So far, no arrests have been announced in the case. This morning, homicide detective Mike Newton told The Brew that the lockdown was necessary to collect evidence.

One community group took pictures of a checkpoint in West Baltimore.

Citizens describe how their day lives have been disrupted as West Baltimore remains under police control, as per Baltimore Brew:

Two women walking down Franklin Street to get to their cars, parked blocks away because of the lockdown, complained that they had been harassed by officers.

“They know I live here. They’ve seen me come and go. But this one had to pat me down. He [the officer] went like this to my jacket, grabbing it,” said Shelly, 25, who asked that her last name not be used.

“They wanted to know where I had been. Why do I have to tell him that? It’s just me in my flip-flops trying to go to my own home.”

“We haven’t been able to get our mail for four days,” said the woman with her, Samantha, 50, who also asked not be identified. “Is the city going to pay the late fees on my bills?”

“It’s so sad what happened to the officer and I hope they catch whoever did it,” another woman said. “But this is really overboard. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

The ACLU of Maryland released a statement yesterday, who are “troubled by reports that some persons entering or leaving the area have been subject to pat down searches, and that non-residents have been barred from entering the area.”

“While the search for a killer is, of course, a high priority for the police, the limits on lawful police behavior do not disappear even when engaged in that pursuit. And at least one federal appellate court has said that a similar police cordon and checkpoint system was unconstitutional.

“The residents of Baltimore, and, in particular, the residents of the affected community, deserve a clear explanation from the City as to why this unprecedented action has been taken, what rules are being enforced, and why it is lawful. The need to secure a crime scene from contamination to preserve evidence does not, on its face, explain the wide area to which access has been restricted for days after the incident.”

On-the-ground information is scarce to those outside the cordon because access to residents, including by the media, has also been restricted. For that reason, we encourage anyone who has this kind of information to contact us at [email protected]

This is the 3rd time in less than 3 years that West Baltimore has been occupied by police: 1) April 27 – May 1 in 2015 after the funeral of Freddie Gray

2) June 27, 2016 at a street celebration of the life of rapper Lor Scoota

3) Nov. 16-???? in 2017 after Det. Suiter was killed pic.twitter.com/C85qSSl6Br — T’Challa ☀️Ra ? (@BmoreDoc) November 18, 2017

Baltimore Brew concludes by saying the Baltimore Police will “clear the crime scene” on Monday, so in a few hours.

Perhaps in a preview of things to come, the 4-5 day siege of West Baltimore by Police has been described by one resident as “Martial Law.” Readers concerned about social tensions in the US are urged to monitor events in Baltimore, which better than Chicago or Detroit now demonstrates just how the United States is marching straight into a new, Orwellian era.

Lab Created Super-Mosquitos Released Into Wild Could ‘Make All Men Infertile’,"Reddit Email WhatsApp More 110 Shares

Millions of disease carrying mosquitoes are to be freed in a well-meaning bid to decimate natural populations of the malaria-spreading insects.

The lab-grown versions are infected with a disease which prevents natural mosquito populations from breeding.

But some activists fear the disease could transfer to humans ultimately making all human males sterile.

Despite claims it is safe for humans, there are also some concerns, it could affect other arthropods, such as spiders which pray on mosquitoes, therefore increasing populations in the long run, or even people, rendering humans unable to breed.

In a decision that has not been formally announced, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will allow the release of the killer insects in 20 states and Washington DC.

They have been bred by the company MosquitoMate in a bid to drastically reduce the population of the disease-carrying Asian tiger mosquito (A aegypti), which is responsible for infecting humans with viruses such as dengue, yellow fever and Zika, which has caused birth defects in babies.

The firm creates mosquitoes infected with the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis which prevents natural mosquitoes from breeding.

These risks of humans or other arthropods being affected are said to be extremely low, but the full impact will not been known until mass releases happen, according to scientists.

Canadian blogger Rose Webster is behind a campaign to stop the releases.

She has spent months speaking to scientists and fears that it may be possible for Wolbachia to infect humans, and prevent individuals from breeding.

She is also convinced that Wolbachia releases have actually helped the spread of the Zika virus.

She said: “Wolbachia is responsible for the most widespread pandemics in the animal kingdom.

“Safety tests were never carried out on vertebrate species prior to Wolbachia-infected mosquito releases carried out in Brazil, Columbia, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Australia, California, and Florida.

“It’s akin to putting genetic dynamite in a species.

“Wolbachia can survive about a week in a dead host. Lateral transfers to other species have happened.

“This could be the reason that Zika is spreading out of control.

“Wolbachia doesn’t just magically disappear when these mosquitoes die off naturally or are consumed.

“Here is what I am sure of:

“The CDC and WHO (and Health Canada) have ignored critical scientific facts and solid evidence from ethical scientists.

“Why? I don’t know. Perhaps because some regions of the world are so overpopulated that even certain governments are willing to fund something that is likely cause men to become sterile (Wolbachia) and is the unspoken co-factor amplifying Zika.”

An article about the risk on “truth finding” website Courtofrecord.com said: “Years ago, a laboratory experiment to infect mice with Wolbachia failed.

“Scott O’Neill of Yale Medical School points out that the bacteria are intolerant of the basal body temperature of mammals.

“However, Werren points out that it is too early to dismiss the possibility of Wolbachia infecting vertebrates.

“At least some scientists believe the notion of Wolbachia in humans is not entirely preposterous.”

A February 2015 a scientific study of a patient with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma who was found to have wolbachia genes was published on clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com.

It concluded there was the potential for the bacteria to infect humans.

The report said: “Wolbachia spp should be further evaluated as causes of human infection, especially as Wolbachia infection of mosquitoes is increasingly considered to be a tool for interfering with mosquito-borne transmission of human pathogens.

“The findings suggest the potential for Wolbachia bacteria to infect humans.”

Yet many scientists believe it is perfectly safe.

David O’Brochta, an entomologist at the University of Maryland in Rockville, said: “It’s a non-chemical way of dealing with mosquitoes, so from that perspective, you’d think it would have a lot of appeal.

“I’m glad to see it pushed forward, as I think it could be potentially really important.” MosquitoMate rears the infected insects in laboratories. Males, which do not bite, are released into a high mosquito population area. They mate with wild females, and the infection of Wolbachia into the latter means the fertilised eggs do not hatch, because paternal chromosomes do not form properly. The plan is that over time the natural population will dwindle. Stephen Dobson, an entomologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington and founder of MosquitoMate, said other insect populations, including mosquito predators, are not affected by the lab-grown disease. There are concerns that female lab-grown insects, which do bite may be released. Staff currently separate males from females by hand and mechanically based on size differences at pupal stage. Zhiyong Xi, a medical entomologist and microbiologist at Michigan State University, who leads the project, said this is 99 percent successful, meaning up to one percent released could be female. Mosquitoes released are then subject to radiation to sterilise females but not males. The technique has been tested extensively in Brazil, following the 2015 zika outbreak, and populations of disease carriers have drastically dropped in test areas. There were concerns from the public when another firm Oxitec wanted to test the mosquitoes in the Florida Keys area. Objections from the public in late 2016 mean the tests were postponed. Concerns ranged from any risk of the lab-grown insects being able to infect humans, the natural disease carriers becoming immune to them, or it decimating populations of other arthropods, including the spiders that feed on the natural mossies. Oxitec said only 62 female mosquitoes per person in an area would be inadvertently released, but it was hard to predict how many would land on humans. An EPA environmental impact document about the plan said: “Mosquitoes have been feeding on humans and other animals for millennia but there is no evidence of DNA transfer between mosquitoes and humans. “There’s also ‘negligible’ risk that the GM mosquito saliva would have any toxic or allergenic effects on humans.” Simon Warner, Oxitec’s chief scientific officer in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in the UK, said there was “no reason to think their lab strain—descendants of mosquitoes collected in Cuba, crossed with a Mexican strain—would be any more dangerous than another strain of (Asian Tiger mosquito) A aegypti. He said: “Vector competence is not a question that we’ve been asked by the regulators. “We haven’t studied it, because we don’t think it’s a concern.” Oxitec said in tests four percent of infected wild mosquitoes went onto to produce offspring, so some could be immune. Entomologist Zach Adelman, of Texas A&M University in College Station, said: “That’s something that does have to be paid close attention to. “When Oxitec stops its releases, mosquito numbers will rebound, and it is not clear whether or how the genes from the release strain would influence the recovered population, including how mosquitos seek out hosts, mate, or lay eggs. “For example, of key concern is how good Oxitec’s strain is at transmitting viruses compared with wild mosquitoes—its so-called vector competence. “So far, studies of such changes in a post-release population are missing.” Insect geneticist Max Scott of North Carolina State University in Raleigh said it was a “theoretical possibility” that wild mosquitoes could become immune, but that should not stop the tests. Express.co.uk found research carried out by the School of Biological Sciences, at The University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, in 2010, when they were looking to test a similar system. The scientific study considered the risk to humans. It said: “A major concern the community repeatedly expressed was whether Wolbachia could be transferred to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes.” However, it said: “Wolbachia have never been found in humans or other mammals, neither in birds, reptiles or fish.” Despite the limited risks, tests were carried out on people, and no infections were found. It said: “Both immunological investigations, Western blots and ELISA, show that humans repeatedly bitten by Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti develop antibodies against mosquitoes as already described for exposed humans, but do not develop IgG antibody against Wolbachia. “All those results indicate that Wolbachia antigens are not injected into humans during the mosquito bloodmeal and therefore do not initiate an immune response in human host.” However, in a section entitled “To implement or not to implement?”, it said the full effects would not be known until they were released on mass. It said: “A number of experiments were conducted to verify that the Wolbachia-based strategy to control mosquito-borne disease is safe for people, other organisms and the environment. “The results presented in this paper show that no experimental evidence of any negative impact of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes was obtained. “Assessing experimentally the potential consequences that could happen over a long-term period and large geographic scale could be a daunting task. “Many questions related to long-term consequences can only be assessed once the release is done. “Questions such as the evolution of the virus in response to the presence of Wolbachia, or the persistence of the virus blocking phenotype after generations in natural population are examples of key concerns for the scientific project and for the community but indeed require a priori the release to be answered.” via: express.co.uk",2017-11-16 18:28:34-04:00,,0
Russia’s FSB Reports Michael Jackson Assassinated By CIA,"FSB sources are reporting to President Medvedev today that American pop icon Michael Jackson was “most assuredly” assassinated by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) after an examination of data transmitted by a Russian Military’s Kosmos 2450 satellite show “conclusively” that immediately prior to the music stars death in Los Angeles an electromagnetic pulse consistent in pattern to EMR weapons looted from the former Soviet Union by the United States was employed at the “exact coordinates” of the rock stars home.

To the type of technology being perfected by the US Military-Industrial Complex based upon former Soviet Union research used in these kinds of assassinations we can read about as reported by Cheryl Welsh, president, Citizens Against Human Rights Abuse, in her landmark 2001 report “Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) Weapons: As Powerful As The Atomic Bomb”, and which says:

“A newly declassified U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report says- extensive Soviet research into microwaves might lead to methods of causing disoriented human behavior, nerve disorders or even heart attacks…. A copy of the study was provided by the agency to The Associated Press in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The Pentagon agency refused to release some portions of the study, saying they remain classified on national security grounds.”

Even more importantly, since Ms Welsh’s landmark report in 2001, the US has continued perfecting this insidious technology they’ve named Active Denial System (ADS), and as we can read as reported by New Scientist in their 2005 report titled “US Military seeks new non-lethal weapon; the prototype of the phaser?”, and which says:

“The US military is funding development of a weapon that delivers a bout of excruciating pain from up to 2 kilometres away. Intended for use against rioters, it is meant to leave victims unharmed. But pain researchers are furious that work aimed at controlling pain has been used to develop a weapon. And they fear that the technology will be used for torture.”

To the ‘final’ employment of these weapons [3rd photo, left] we can also read:

“In January 2007, Theodore Barna, an assistant deputy undersecretary of defense for advanced systems and concepts told Reuters that “We expect the services to add it to their tool kit. And that could happen as early as 2010”.

Apparently the military is still unsure about ADS after all the tests. Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne didn’t help clarify the issue when he suggested that the military should use the “pain ray” at crowds in the United States before deploying it in Iraq. It would be hard to imagine that Americans would be feeling okay about trying such weapons on themselves even if they believe they are not lethal.

Wagner suggested a new nickname for the weapon; the “death ray”, since it’s well-known that exposing mammals to microwaves make them explode. He sent an email all around the U.S. in which he used a live example to prove his theory.”

To the reason behind the CIA needing to assassinate Michael Jackson, these reports continue, was an out of court settlement the pop icon signed with son of the king of Bahrain, Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad al-Khalifa, this past November in London, and which stated, in part, that in exchange for millions of dollars previously lent to Mr. Jackson by the Sheikh, Mr. Jackson would allow his sold-out United Kingdom concerts to be a “platform” for warning the World of a soon to occur mass genocide event.

Both Michael Jackson and Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad al-Khalifa have been long standing supporters of the fearless Austrian investigative journalist, Jane Burgermeister, who is warning the world that the greatest crime in the history of humanity is underway, and as we can read:

“Jane Burgermeister has recently filed criminal charges with the FBI against the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations (UN), and several of the highest ranking government and corporate officials concerning bioterrorism and attempts to commit mass murder. She has also prepared an injunction against forced vaccination which is being filed in America. These actions follow her charges filed in April against Baxter AG and Avir Green Hills Biotechnology of Austria for producing contaminated bird flu vaccine, alleging this was a deliberate act to cause and profit from a pandemic.

In her charges, Burgermeister presents evidence of acts of bioterrorism that is in violation of U.S. law by a group operating within the U.S. under the direction of international bankers who control the Federal Reserve, as well as WHO, UN and NATO. This bioterrorism is for the purpose of carrying out a mass genocide against the U.S. population by use of a genetically engineered flu pandemic virus with the intent of causing death. This group has annexed high government offices in the U.S.

Specifically, evidence is presented that the defendants, Barack Obama, President of the U.S, David Nabarro, UN System Coordinator for Influenza, Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO, Kathleen Sibelius, Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Department of Homeland Security, David de Rotschild, banker, David Rockefeller, banker, George Soros, banker, Werner Faymann, Chancellor of Austria, and Alois Stoger, Austrian Health Minister, among others, are part of this international corporate criminal syndicate which has developed, produced, stockpiled and employed biological weapons to eliminate the population of the U.S. and other countries for financial and political gain.

The charges contend that these defendants conspired with each other and others to devise, fund and participate in the final phase of the implementation of a covert international bioweaponsprogram involving the pharmaceutical companies Baxter and Novartis. They did this by bioengineering and then releasing lethal biological agents, specifically the “bird flu” virus and the “swine flu virus” in order to have a pretext to implement a forced mass vaccination program which would be the means of administering a toxic biological agent to cause death and injury to the people of the U.S. This action is in direct violation of the Biological Weapons Anti-terrorism Act.”

Interesting to note, too, is on the day of Michael Jackson’s assassination, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that their mathematical models show over 1 million Americans have contracted swine flu and that of the 58,000 confirmed cases around the World the US has over half of them, and even worse, Emergency Containment Areas are now being reported being set up in that troubled country.

Sadly though, and with an acknowledgement that this World star had led a much troubled life, it can never be taken away from Michael Jackson the real love he had for all of humanity and best expressed by him in the chorus of his anthem to the human race, We Are The World:

Heal the world

Make it a better place

For you and for me and the entire human race

There are people dying

If you care enough for the living

Make a better place for

You and for me.

Scientists and Doctors Call for Return to Normal Life in The Great Barrington Declaration,"Story Highlights On Oct. 6, 2020, an international group of scientists, doctors and other medical professionals issued a petition, The Great Barrington Declaration (GBD), challenging the wisdom of current restrictive public health strategies employed by governments for addressing COVID-19.

The GBD signatories called for “focused protection” that commits resources to protecting vulnerable populations, allowing most people to return to normal life.

The scientists and medical professionals signing the GBD point out that potential ramifications of current strategies include long-term mental health issues, worsening cardiovascular

disease and other pre-existing conditions, significant financial hardship and increased incidence of domestic partner and child abuse.

On Oct. 6, 2020, an international coalition of scientists, doctors and medical professionals created and signed a document they titled The Great Barrington Declaration (GBD), which was named for the Massachusetts town where organizers gathered and in which the petition was signed.1 By the end of October, the Declaration had already secured signatures from 10,233 scientists, 27,860 medical professionals and 504,875 concerned citizens.2

In the document, infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists from all over the world expressed their deep concern about the potential negative repercussions of lockdown measures imposed by governments in the wake of COVID-19 and called for a global policy change to what they call “focused protection.”

The Great Barrington Declaration Highlights Negative Effects of Lockdowns

The creators of the GBD3 maintain that “current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health,” including fewer healthcare screening visits, worse outcomes for cardiovascular disease and other pre-existing conditions, and serious effects on mental health. Stating that “vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young” and further, that “for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza,” the authors recommend measures be put in place to protect vulnerable segments of society, while allowing all others to immediately return to normal life.

Specifically, they suggest that nursing home staff should be limited to those with acquired immunity, staff rotation should be minimized and all staff and visitors should be frequently tested. Groceries and other essentials should be delivered to elderly who live in the community and the vulnerable should interact with people outside whenever possible. For everyone else, the authors recommend that:

schools and universities should immediately reopen for in-person

attendance, including all extracurricular activities;

attendance, including all extracurricular activities; businesses and restaurants should open fully;

art, music, sports and other group events should resume; and

young low-risk adults should return to work instead of working from home.

Martin Kulldorff, PhD, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and one of the three initial signatories of the GBD said, “As a public-health scientist, it is stunning to see how focused people are on this one disease and on the short term.” He argues that public health policy must focus on health as a whole, including all diseases, and should take a long view rather than opting for a short-term solution.

Dr. Kulldorff also asserted his belief that even if we choose to focus on COVID-19 alone, the lockdowns and isolations do not make sense:

We sought to flatten the curve in the spring so as not to overload hospitals, and that succeeded in almost every country. But trying to suppress the disease with contact tracing, testing and isolation, together with severe lockdowns, is not going to solve the problem. It will just push things into the future.4

Pointing at Sweden—which did not impose strict lockdown measures for the past year—as an example of the economic and social benefits of a more relaxed approach to protective measures, he stressed that COVID-19 is much less serious than seasonal influenza for children. Breaking down statistics on Sweden’s 5,900,000 COVID-19 deaths as of Oct. 22, 2020, only two occurred in children under age 9, while 4,004 deaths were in people ages 80 and above.5

Others Argue That Lower Risk of COVID-19 Does Not Mean No Risk

Some argue that, while older people are more likely to experience severe symptoms or to die from COVID-19, children and young people are not immune to infection, even serious infection.6 The CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that more than 20 percent of confirmed cases during the summer months occurred in people between 20 and 29 years of age. For the week of Sept. 28, the National Center for Health Statistics reported 1,800 COVID-19-related deaths in people under age 35, with 419 of those in young people under age 25. They also reported that 851 children under age 18 have been hospitalized with severe disease. Those numbers are updated every week and, as of Oct. 22, there have been 2,090 reported deaths involving COVID-19 in Americans under age 35, with 462 in individuals under age 25.7

Long-Term Damage Expected from COVID-19 Restrictions

Most experts agree that lockdowns are expected to have major long-term socio-economic consequences for populations. A U.N. report focusing on the impact on children and young people warned that, “All children, of all ages, and in all countries, are being affected, in particular by the socio-economic impacts and, in some cases, by mitigation measures that may inadvertently do more harm than good,” and, further, that “the impact will be life-long.” Analysis of data from more than 60 pre-existing, peer-reviewed studies indicated a strong association between loneliness and future mental health issues in young people, suggesting that the duration of loneliness had a greater impact than degree.8

Looking at current pandemic strategies, Dr. Kulldorff also pointed out that lockdown measures disproportionately affect the working class, who may not be able to work (restaurant staff for example, if their place of business is closed) or are unable to work or isolate at home (such as those in service industries). In this way, Kulldorff argues, we are effectively “throwing the working class under the bus,” while protecting the more privileged such as college students and business professionals who can more easily work from home.9

Mental Health and Economic Repercussions from COVID-19 Lockdowns

Decreases in preventive care and screening visits, increases in risk for mental health issues, significant financial losses and the potential collapse of many restaurants and small businesses that may be unable to rebound are not the only ramifications of isolation and lockdown policies. There also has been a sharp uptick in both the number and severity of incidents of intimate partner violence (IPV) during the pandemic compared to the three years prior, with increases in calls to domestic abuse helplines reported worldwide. 10

Some of the factors identified during COVID-19 lockdowns as potential stressors that could lead to increased domestic violence include socioeconomic instability, avoidance of healthcare facilities due to fear of catching the virus, lack of community support, increased substance abuse and more time spent at home with partners. 11

During this same period, the National Children’s Alliance (NCA), reporting for more than 900 children’s advocacy centers (CACs) across the U.S., says they have seen 21 percent fewer child abuse cases in this year, correlating to about 40,000 fewer children served compared to the same period last year. Child safety advocates attribute the change to an underreporting of abuse in the face of

COVID-19. As NCA Executive Director Teresa Huizar put it:

It really did exemplify our worst fears, which is that kids are home and that they were outside the view line in many cases of trusted adults and teachers and counselors and coaches and physicians―all the folks who normally are making reports as mandated reporters.12

In the words of Dr. Kulldorff in advocating for the GBD, the strategies to try to contain and combat COVID-19 have amounted to “a unique experiment, and it’s a terrible experiment… in a short time, we are throwing all the principles of public health out the window.”13 Those who have signed the GBD and others maintain that COVID-19 will always be with us and that we must use traditional, more balanced public health strategies, while adapting to living with the new coronavirus until populations acquire immunity and the disease becomes less virulent.

CDC Gives States COVID-19 Vaccination Program “Playbook”,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) created a national COVID-19 Vaccine Program Playbook for state, territorial and local public health officials and their partners and issued directions for how to plan and operationalize COVID-19 vaccine programs in their jurisdictions. State health departments throughout the United States submitted comprehensive drafts of their COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) on Oct. 16, 2020.1

CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccination Program Playbook

Many of the COVID-19 vaccination program initiatives described in the CDC’s playbook may overlap with routine vaccination programs already in place. For example, routine child and adult vaccination and pandemic influenza program activities can serve as a foundation for COVID-19 vaccination planning.2

The CDC’s 51-page plan calls for different phases for distributing the vaccine. Due to changing vaccine supply levels at various stages during the national COVID-19 vaccination program, the planning will be flexible but as specific as possible to accommodate a variety of scenarios. Health officials are projecting that coronavirus vaccine supplies will be limited immediately after licensure. Therefore, the first allocation of vaccine doses will target healthcare workers and populations considered to be a high risk for COVID-19 complications, such as individuals over 65 years old. As vaccine supplies increase quickly following licensure, distribution of the vaccine will be expanded to other populations that health officials consider to be at high risk and, then, to the general public.3

Vaccine Distribution Determined by Federal Government

According to the CDC’s guidelines, after a COVID-19 vaccine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), federal officials will determine how many doses will be distributed to each state or region. States will then be responsible for distributing the doses to local vaccine providers.4

Paul Mango, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) said that the federal government is in the process of “actively engaging tens of thousands of provider outlets for these vaccines”.5 He added that the U.S. currently has assembled 40 million-plus vaccination kits with the bottles, needles and other items needed to administer the vaccine: “All of those are in warehouses ready to go, so that’s a big logistical task or undertaking,” Mango said.6

Vaccine Storage and Infrastructure Concerns

Depending on which COVID-19 vaccine gets approved (or if several coronavirus vaccines are approved), storage and handling of the vaccine will vary accordingly. Since Pfizer, Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b1, needs to be stored at 94 degrees below zero, it will require special storage equipment and transportation. The company will only be shipping about 500 to 1,000 doses at a time. Moderna’s vaccine candidate will need to be stored at four degrees below zero. The concern is that many providers do not have ultra-cold freezers and the infrastructure that safe and effective storage of these vaccines require.7

Sounding a note of caution, Marcus Plescia, MD, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials said, “Everybody needs to realize it’s not going to be seamless.”8

Brazilian Doctor Dies Participating in AstraZeneca’s COVID-19...,"Story Highlights A COVID-19 vaccine trial participant, who was a physician working with COVID-19 patients at hospitals in Brazil, has reportedly died from coronavirus infection complications.

It has not been confirmed, but sources indicate the victim was given the trial “placebo” (a meningococcal vaccine) and not the experimental AZD1222 vaccine developed by pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and Oxford University.

In September, AstraZeneca temporarily halted its COVID-19 vaccine trials when a participant developed inflammation of the spinal cord after vaccination in one of its trials in the United Kingdom.

A 28-year-old physician volunteer in Brazil, who was participating in a Phase 3 clinical trial of the experimental AZD1222 (formerly ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) for COVID-19 developed by AstraZeneca plc and Oxford University, died on Oct. 15, 2020. Early reports did not specify whether he had received the AZD1222 vaccine or a meningitis vaccine used as a “placebo.” It has since been reported that the man did receive the meningococcal vaccine used as a placebo in the trial instead of the experimental coronavirus vaccine, although no official confirmation has been released by AstraZeneca, which has cited privacy concerns for not making more information available to the public.1

The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) released a statement saying, “according to national and international regulations on good clinical practices, data on clinical research volunteers must be kept confidential, in accordance with the principles of confidentiality, human dignity, and protection of participants.”2 However, the Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported that the victim was a physician working with COVID-19 patients at three hospitals in Brazil and died from complications arising from an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. That information has been verified by other sources and the deceased has been identified as Joao Pedro Feitosa of Rio de Janeiro.3

“Laypersons Are Being Given Information They Can’t Understand”

In the comment section to Medscape’s article, “Brazil Confirms Death of Volunteer in COVID-19 Vaccine Trial,”4 which is limited to commentators from the medical community, the source was chastised for publishing a “misleading and inflammatory headline,” for adding to public confusion and creating possible misgivings about a future COVID-19 vaccine because “laypersons are being given information they cannot understand” and for fear mongering in reporting on the death at all when so much was unknown.

Several commenters alluded to the victim’s status as a front-line health care worker, noting that he was likely exposed to higher viral loads than other trial volunteers and that “those getting large repeated viral load inoculum no matter their health status is a huge risk the virus will just over run their immune system before it can even mount a appropriate response.” It was further suggested that this doctor might not have been a suitable candidate for the trial at all at this stage because his close contact with COVID-19 patients from three different hospitals would have put him at risk for a much higher than usual viral load.

Many Unknowns About the COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Participant Who Died

One person who commented on the Medscape article pointed out that, in addition to unconfirmed assumptions about whether the deceased volunteer was in the experimental or placebo arm of the trial, other questions also remain. It is not known, for example, whether other than his profession that made him more vulnerable to being infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, the participant had underlying health conditions that placed him at high risk for COVID-19 complications. There is also no information about the timeline between his potential exposure relative to receiving the meningitis “placebo” vaccine injection or between injection and death. No details are yet known about the cause of death, aside from the attribution to “complications of COVID-19” and it is not known whether he mounted any type of antibody or other immune system response to the coronavirus infection.

Further, there is little information about the type of meningococal vaccine “placebo” the physician was given in the trial and a potential interaction between his apparent SARS-Cov2 viral infection and the administration of a meningitis vaccine that could have caused a serious adverse response.

The Clinical Trial in Brazil is Expected to Continue

In a public statement, Oxford University said, “All significant medical incidents, whether participants are in the control group or the COVID-19 vaccine group, are independently reviewed. Following careful assessment of this case in Brazil, there have been no concerns about safety of the clinical trial and the independent review in addition to the Brazilian regulator have recommended that the trial should continue.”5

AstraZeneca’s Phase 3 trials on the AZD1222 vaccine had been halted last month when a trial participant developed inflammation of the spinal cord after vaccination in the United Kingdom. That trial was resumed in the U.K. after a review by Britain’s Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). The trial on AZD1222 vaccine in the United States remains on hold pending an investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).6

AZD1222 (formerly ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) uses a genetically engineered adenovirus that causes common cold symptoms in chimpanzees (ChAdOx1 – chimpanzee adenovirus Oxford 1) and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus surface spike protein. The AZD1222 vaccine induces production of the coronavirus surface spike protein, priming the immune system to attack the coronavirus if it later infects the body and causes COVID-19 disease.7

No adenovirus-based vaccine has been successfully developed for use in humans, and questions have been raised about the approach.8 9

Pharma’s Public Pledge On COVID-19 Vaccines,"On Sept. 8, 2020, nine pharmaceutical companies working on COVID-19 vaccines signed a pledge saying they would not submit their experimental vaccines to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) unless they were shown to be both safe and efficacious in the Phase 3 human clinical trials.1 2 3 4 5

The pledge, signed by the CEOs of AstraZeneca plc, BioNTech SE, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Moderna, Inc., Novavax, Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Sanofi SA expressed the companies’ “on-going commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for COVID-19 in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles” and promised that they would “always make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority.”1 2 3 4 5

The pledge was signed just two days after the results of a CBS News/YouGov poll of 2,493 registered U.S. voters were published showing that 65 percent of them were skeptical about the safety of any COVID-19 vaccine made available this year due to concerns about it being “rushed through without enough testing.” Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, indirectly referenced the poll (and other similar polls) as a reason for the pledge.5 6 7 Bourla said:

With increasing public concerns about the processes that we are using to develop these vaccines and even more importantly the processes that will be used to evaluate the vaccines, we thought it was critical to come out and reiterate our commitment.2

The CEOs said they believe the pledge will help “ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which COVID-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved.”1

Public Trust in Pharma is Very Low

But how far, really, will the pledge go toward allaying public fears? Particularly given the appearance it was made out of self interest specifically to counteract plummeting public confidence. Also, it’s not like the American public’s trust and confidence in the pharmaceutical industry and government agency regulation and oversight is exactly stellar. In fact, a recent Gallup poll shows that public trust in biopharmaceutical companies is at an all-time low.8 9

According to the Gallup poll:

The pharmaceutical industry is now the most poorly regarded industry in Americans’ eyes, ranking last on a list of 25 industries that Gallup tests annually. Americans are more than twice as likely to rate the pharmaceutical industry negatively (58%) as positively (27%).9

Referencing the poll, an article in Biopharma Dive noted “the public sees the drug industry as falling short of its responsibility to society—a shortcoming severe and persistent enough to sap the public’s trust.”8

So why take the word of nine pharma CEOs whose companies stand to make billions of dollars in sales for years to come if their COVID-19 vaccines, which have been heavily subsidized by taxpayer dollars, are approved by the FDA and sold in the U.S.? Clearly, there is a huge financial incentive to say and do everything possible to encourage the American people to get over their fears and get vaccinated with these vaccines as soon as they become available.

Billions of Dollars at Stake With COVID-19 Vaccines

Analysts at investment bank SVB Leerink of Boston, Massachusetts are projecting that Pfizer alone may earn $3.5 billion in sales from its COVID-19 vaccine in 2021 and $1.4 billion annually after that. SVB Leerink analysts said they “expect the virus to become endemic in the human population” and that their “current assumption is that vaccinees will need to be revaccinated every two years or so to maintain protective immunity.” They added, “We assumed high operating margin around 75%-80% initially, with minimal sales and marketing expense, which is different from other pharmaceutical products.”

Industry news website Fierce Pharma reported that profits for Pfizer from its COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) could be significant “given the urgency among politicians and the general populous to put an end to the pandemic.10

The headline of a recent article in The New York Times reads “COVID-19 Vaccines Offer Drug Makers Chance at Salvation, Financial and Beyond.” The article opens, “Big profits beckon for pharmaceutical companies, which are already using their work on vaccines to fight efforts in Washington to curb drug prices.” It cites a sales estimate of $20 billion for COVID-19 vaccines in the first year they are introduced.11 The article continues:

For a long time, drug makers have been the most hated industry in America. Companies are blamed for gouging prices on lifesaving drugs and enriching themselves through the opioid crisis, among other sins. Now, with pharmaceutical companies racing to find vaccines to end the coronavirus pandemic, the industry is hoping to redeem itself in the public’s mind.11

This reads more like a plea and cautionary warning than a glowing vote of confidence in the moral integrity of a wealthy and politically powerful industry that is pledging it will abide by “high ethical standards and sound scientific principles” in its development of COVID-19 vaccines. So it is not unreasonable to say that this sudden statement committing to ethical behavior rings a little hollow.

DES Tragedy Offers Cautionary Tale for COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates,"The synthetic estrogen Diesthylstilbestrol (DES) was prescribed to pregnant women in the U.S. from 1938 to 1971 for the prevention of miscarriages and premature births. In 1953, published research showed that DES did not in fact prevent miscarriages or premature births. However, physicians continued to prescribe it until 1971, when the FDA warned that the drug could cause cancer in women exposed to DES in the womb.1

The daughters of women who used DES while pregnant have about 40 times the risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma of the lower genital tract than unexposed women, and also experience greater risk of infertility, pregnancy complications and breast cancer. It is estimated that between five to ten million Americans were exposed to DES between 1940 and 1971.2

DES, Thalidomide, Vioxx: A Cautionary Tale

DES now takes its place in history alongside such tragedies as Thalidomide, Vioxx, and the Swine Flu vaccine—all medications determined to be safe for our use and given to millions of people, but then found to be dangerous. In the case of DES, the effects persist through the generations, as new research now shows that the granddaughters and grandsons of women exposed to DES are also at increased risk for cancer and birth defects.3

Today, there are over 150 coronavirus vaccines in the pipeline,4 including some that use technologies that could change human DNA.5 The leading drug company contenders are conducting trials that follow participants for only a few weeks to monitor for acute effects, such as headaches, fevers, muscle weakness, or injection site pain.

Knowledge Gaps in COVID-19 Clinical Trials

But those clinical trials are not designed to tell us anything about whether those vaccines cause infertility, birth defects, or cancer, or whether they will contribute to autoimmune disorders, fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes, neurodevelopmental disorders, inflammatory conditions, or neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

They also cannot tell us what will happen if we have already been infected with and recovered from the new coronavirus or when our bodies encounter another common strain of coronavirus—or any other virus, for that matter—after we or our children have been given a COVID-19 vaccine.

In short, they cannot tell us if any near term gain comes at the expense of long term pain.

Every person who receives these hastily developed vaccines will become an unwitting participant in the uncontrolled, liability-free medical experiment to learn about the long-term effects of these vaccines. Unfortunately, as time passes the connection between the vaccine and ill effects is lost, and any connections that are made will be relegated to a footnote in the Post Marketing Experience section of the manufacturer’s insert.

Forced Use of COVID-19 Vaccines A Human Rights Violation

Anyone who wants to participate in this experiment should be free to do so. But forcing people to participate in a medical experiment goes against the universally accepted ethic of medical informed consent and the Declaration of Human Rights created in Nuremburg following the brutal medical experiments conducted by Germany on its citizens during World War II. How can our government officials believe it is acceptable to violate these bedrock tenets of human rights?

“But we’re in a pandemic,” they say. “People are dying and a mandatory vaccine is our only way out.”

It’s unlikely that a coronavirus vaccine will be our savior. Some health officials estimate that effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine may be as low as 50 percent,6 with the prospect of multiple boosters repeated yearly, and with masking, distancing, dividers, and other measures continuing to be a regular part of our daily lives.7

Alternatives to Mandated Use of COVID-19 Vaccine

Is a mandatory vaccine our only choice? New studies are tumbling out of research institutions, including a recently published study from Boston University showing that when vitamin D levels are adequate the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 is reduced by 54 percent. Many other studies consistently report that in patients with COVID-19, both mortality and severity were significantly reduced in people with adequate vitamin D levels.8 In fact, the benefits of vitamin D are so compelling that even Dr. Fauci reports that he takes vitamin D supplements.9

If we truly care about protecting people from this virus, why aren’t we testing for vitamin D levels and encouraging supplements when needed? Vitamin D is readily available, easily administered, safe, and inexpensive.

What about sick leave policies that ensure that people can stay home when they’re sick without sacrificing the rent?

Many of the risk factors for COVID-19 are lifestyle induced. If we can spend billions to develop a vaccine, why can’t we develop policies and programs to help people reduce their risk factors and strengthen the herd? We have an epidemic of obesity and chronic disease in the U.S.—conditions that put people at risk not just from COVID-19, but from other opportunistic infections that affect all of us.

Flawed Regulatory Process Will Not Protect Us from Potential COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse Effects

There is so much at stake here. The lessons of DES are that the regulatory process is flawed and cannot be relied upon to protect us, and that not all consequences of pharmaceutical products are immediately apparent. Our experiences with DES, Thalidomide, and the Swine Flu vaccine should be cautionary tales as we grapple with our current knowledge gaps about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the effects of coronavirus vaccines developed at warp speed.

A vaccine for a virus we don’t fully understand, that has skipped standard animal testing, gone through expedited trials with no long term risk analysis, using a technology with no safety record, to manipulate an immune system whose complexity is still not fully understood, is not only arrogant, it is dangerous. For these and other reasons, a coronavirus vaccine should never be made mandatory.

What Does Zinc Bring to the Table?,"Story Highlights Zinc is a trace element necessary for human health and has many important benefits including anti-inflammatory properties and powerful immune system support.

It has long been used to reduce the duration and severity of the common cold, which is generally caused by coronaviruses.

Zinc is not made by or stored in the body and must be replenished through the diet (meat, shellfish, beans and nuts are among the food sources) or taken in supplements.

Along with other natural supplements like vitamin C, vitamin D and melatonin, zinc is getting a lot of attention for its potential role in supporting immune function during coronavirus infections, and studies are currently underway to evaluate its use in various treatment modalities. Among many others, one study is looking at zinc as part of a combination including an antibiotic, either azithromycin or doxycycline1; another is evaluating prophylactic combination therapy including vitamin C and zinc in volunteer health care workers.2

Although results of these studies are not yet available, Mahir Ozmen, MD, a professor of surgery at the Istinye University School of Medicine in Istanbul, Turkey and lead researcher in the second study, believes the best treatments for COVID-19 will include zinc and vitamins C and D. Zinc enters and destroys the infected cell, and vitamins C and D support immune function.3 4

Zinc is a mineral and a so-called “essential nutrient” or “essential trace element.” Very small amounts are necessary for human health but it is neither produced by nor stored in the body and must be consistently replenished through the diet.5 6 Zinc plays important roles in many of the body’s systems including metabolism of nutrients, growth and repair of body tissues, gene expression, governing the actions of hundreds of enzymes, synthesis of DNA and proteins, wound healing and supporting healthy immune function.7

Zinc is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. The second most common mineral in the body, after iron, it is present in every cell.8

Benefits of Zinc

Zinc has numerous qualities that make it a useful tool for maintaining health. One of the mechanisms behind its many benefits is activation of T lymphocytes (T cells), which in turn control and regulate immune system responses and act to attack infected or cancerous cells.9 It is thought by some researchers that zinc also may decrease the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.10

Zinc has been found to treat diarrhea in children, to improve memory and learning ability, promote wound healing, improve male fertility and prevent age-related macular degeneration and other chronic conditions in the elderly.11 It also may have some benefits in treating atopic eczema, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, degenerative retinal lesions, Alzheimer’s disease, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and inflammatory bowel disease.12

Zinc Has an Established Benefit in Other Coronaviruses

Historically, the mineral zinc has been found to shorten the duration of the common cold, most often caused by one of four coronaviruses, providing a foundation for the hypothesis that zinc also may be useful in the management of COVID-19.

In looking at its benefits in the common cold, the working theory is that zinc “inhibits the binding of the cold virus to cells within the nasal mucosa and suppresses inflammation.” Because there are few available results of zinc in COVID-19 specifically, its benefits in other conditions are evaluated for relevance. For example, one laboratory study from 2010 was able to demonstrate that zinc inhibited the activity and replication of SARS-CoV, the coronavirus strain responsible for an outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002. Another study done in Spain showed that low zinc levels were predictive of a worse outcome for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.13

Foods High in Zinc

By many accounts, oysters are the best food source of zinc, followed by red meat, poultry, and shellfish like crab and lobster. Beans, nuts, whole grains and dairy foods also provide lesser amounts of zinc.14 Many other foods such as packaged breakfast cereals are fortified with zinc.

Zinc is not as well absorbed from plant-based foods and vegans and vegetarians may need as much as 50 percent more zinc in their diet. It has been suggested that soaking beans in water before cooking them reduces the presence of phytates, which bind to zinc and make it difficult for the body to absorb. Leavened grain products also reduce the level of phytates.15

A Medical News Today report from 2017 listed the following table comparing foods with the highest reported zinc content16:

raw oysters (Pacific), 3 ounces: 14.1 milligrams

beef, lean chuck roast, braised, 3 ounces: 7.0 milligrams

baked beans, canned, ½ cup: 6.9 milligrams

crab, King Alaskan, cooked, 3 ounces: 6.5 milligrams

ground beef, lean, 3 ounces: 5.3 milligrams

lobster, cooked, 3 ounces: 3.4 milligrams

pork loin, lean, cooked, 3 ounces: 2.9 milligrams

wild rice, cooked, ½ cup: 2.2 milligrams

peas, green, cooked, 1 cup: 1.2 milligrams

yogurt, plain, 8 ounces: 1.3 milligrams

pecans, 1 ounces: 1.3 milligrams

peanuts, dry roasted, 1 ounces: 0.9 milligrams

Symptoms of Zinc Deficiencies

Referencing the investigations of “consumer advocate, investigator and author Bill Sardi,”17 Joseph Mercola, DO, notes illness symptoms that may indicate a zinc deficiency. These include but are not limited to dry cough, fever, abdominal discomfort, pneumonia, depressed immune function and loss of sense of smell.18

Zinc deficiencies are not common in the United States, though the worldwide prevalence is high, estimated at 17 percent of the global population. Many factors can increase risk: Age over 60 years; alcoholism; breastfeeding; cancer or chronic conditions such as diabetes, sickle cell anemia, diarrhea, liver or kidney disease; bowel disorders or recent gastrointestinal surgery all can deplete zinc levels. Vegans and vegetarians also are at greater risk since plant-based foods are not the best sources of bioavailable zinc.19

Avoid Overdoing Zinc Supplements

Lozenges containing zinc are commonly used at the very first signs of a cold. Nasal sprays are not recommended as many people experience a loss of smell after using them.20

In general, doctors urge caution when taking supplemental zinc products, as too much zinc can cause toxicity issues including nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, a metallic taste and loss of smell. It also can hinder absorption of copper, potentially causing copper deficiency and anemia, and may have negative interactions with drugs including antibiotics and diuretics.21 In addition to affecting copper absorption, too much zinc also may disrupt absorption and metabolism of iron and vitamin A.22

Many supplements also contain cadmium, another metal that is chemically similar to zinc and often found with it in nature. High levels of cadmium can lead to kidney failure over time. According to Medline Plus, concentrations of cadmium in zinc supplements can vary by as much as 37-fold.23 Among the many types of zinc supplements available, that same source recommends zinc-gluconate supplements, which consistently contain the lowest cadmium levels. Zinc-rich foods do not cause toxic levels of zinc. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), recommended daily doses of zinc vary by age and gender, as follows24:

Babies between 0 and 6 months need 2 mg/day (this amount is equivalent to the level of zinc provided by breast milk. Breastfed babies do not need supplemental zinc)

Babies and children from 7 months to 3 years need 3 mg/day

Children 4 to 8 years, 5 mg/day

Children 9 to 13 years, 8 mg/day

Teens 14 to 18, 11 mg for boys, 9 mg for girls (pregnant teens in that age group need 12 mg/day and lactating teens need 13 mg)

Over age 19, males need 11 mg/day and females need 8 mg/day, with requirements increasing to 11 mg/day during pregnancy and 12 mg/day during lactation.

COVID-19 Lockdowns in New York: A Matter of Religious Freedom?,"On Oct. 7, 2020, Harold Tischler, an Orthodox Jewish activist was arrested and charged with inciting a riot and the unlawful imprisonment of Jacob Korbluh, a journalist, during a protest in Borough Park, Brooklyn. Tischler, an activist, radio talk show host and candidate for Brooklyn City Council is known for speaking out against the COVID-19 restrictions placed on Orthodox Jewish communities in New York.1 2

Korbluh claims that he was unlawfully imprisoned during the protest when he was chased down the street, encircled by Tischler and kicked by the crowd.3 Tischler alleges that Korbluh harassed him the night before the protest.4

Governor Cuomo said that protestors demonstrating against COVID-19 lockdown measures should be arrested and prosecuted for their “criminal behavior.”5 Tischler, who agreed to turn himself into police on Monday after receiving a phone call from the NYPD, was arrested Sunday night.6

Cuomo’s Lockdown Order Goes Into Effect on Jewish Holiday

Tischler’s arrest was preceded by a protest against the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions imposed by Governor Cuomo’s Executive Order (Order), which went into effect Oct. 9, the same day many Jewish communities would typically gather together to celebrate the Jewish holidays, Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah. Cuomo’s Order closed schools, nonessential businesses and restricts non-essential gatherings to a maximum of 10 people, including those in Jewish temples of worship in parts of Brooklyn, Queens, Orange and Rockland counties and a section of Binghamptom.7

The governor’s most recent plan divided the state into red, orange or yellow zones based on the number of positive tests for SARS CoV-2. Houses of worship in the red zone are limited to 25 percent capacity or a maximum of 10 people, those in the orange zone are capped at 33 percent capacity or 25 people and those in the yellow zone are permitted to have 50 percent capacity. Schools in the red and orange zones are shut down, while those in the yellow zone require weekly testing of students and teachers.8 The red zone with the strictest regulations are in neighborhoods that are home to predominately Orthodox Jewish communities.9

Cuomo Targets Orthodox Jews for Strictest Lockdown Measures

Cuomo did not deny that the Orthodox Jewish Community was targeted by his Executive Order. “We’re now having issues with the Orthodox Jewish community in New York where, because of their religious practices etc, we’re seeing a spread.”10 Showing a picture of an Orthodox Jewish prayer service, Cuomo explained, “This is about mass gatherings and one of the prime places of mass gatherings are houses of worship. That is the truth.”11

Governor Cuomo’s Order is punitive, imposing a fine of up to $15,000 on anyone who organizes a mass gathering. To date, five Orthodox Jewish institutions have been fined $15,000.12 The New York State Department of Health and Governor Cuomo threatened local governments and schools in the red and orange zones that they would lose state funding if they failed to close schools and limit the size of gatherings.13 Cuomo warned:

I have to say to the Orthodox community tomorrow, ‘If you’re not willing to live with these rules, then I’m going to close the synagogues.14

Governor Cuomo is Sued for Violating U.S. Constitution’s Free Exercise Clause

In response to New York State’s latest restrictions, an Orthodox Jewish organization, Agudath Israel of America, filed a lawsuit against Governor Cuomo seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the state from restricting attendance at houses of worship in certain areas of the state.15 The Plaintiffs allege that Cuomo’s Executive Order violates the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution by preventing the practice of their religion and ability to provide a religious upbringing for their families. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn filed a similar lawsuit against Cuomo.

The Free Exercise Clause protects the right of Americans to accept and practice any religion free from government interference without due process of law.16 A law violates the Free Exercise Clause when it restricts one’s ability to practice their religion and is not neutral, meaning it does not apply to all people regardless of their religious beliefs or practices.17 A law is not neutral if it targets religious but not secular practices or if it is neutral on its face but restricts religiously motivated behavior.

Laws that are not neutral and restrict religious practices are subject to strict scrutiny in order to be upheld. The U.S. Supreme Court stated,

To satisfy the commands of the First Amendment, a law restrictive of religious practice must advance “interests of the highest order,” and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests… A law that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment or advances legitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a religious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare cases.18

The Complaint points out that by suddenly limiting the number of worshippers in synagogues to only 10 people 48 hours before the start of Jewish holidays, Cuomo not only “explicitly targeted the Orthodox Jewish Community,” but rendered it impossible for tens of thousands of Orthodox Jews to remain faithful to their religious practices and simultaneously comply with the Executive Order.19

The Complaint further states that Governor Cuomo, in his own words, specifically targeted religious institutions with the latest Order and that the restrictions are discriminatory because they do not apply to “essential” businesses nor “essential” gatherings, without defining what constitutes an “essential” gathering.20 Therefore, religiously motivated behavior is restricted, but secular activity may not be restricted in the same manner.

While the state can generally restrict gatherings when necessary to protect public health, if it only restricts certain activities, those restrictions must be truly nondiscriminatory in order to not violate the Free Exercise Clause. Because some mass gatherings are deemed essential and permitted under the Order, but all religious gatherings are restricted, the state must have a compelling justification for this distinction or the Order could be considered discriminatory.21

Many synagogues are large and limiting the capacity to 10 people for all houses of worship despite their size seems excessive and arbitrary. The executive vice president of Agudath Israel of America, Rabbi Zwiebel stated,

Social distancing, masking, and all health precautions must, of course, be observed. However, we think that it is possible to stay safe and at the same time have more than ten people in a Shul building that is meant to hold hundreds.22

The Federal Court Decision: A “Crushing Blow to Religious Freedom”

On Oct. 9, Federal Judge Kiyo Matsumato, of the U.S. Eastern District of New York court in Brooklyn denied the Plaintiff’s request for an emergency restraining order delivering what Plaintiff Agudath deemed a “crushing blow to religious freedom.”23

The judge wrote,

Plaintiffs failed to show, among other things, a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that [Cuomo’s executive order] is otherwise unconstitutional or violates the free exercise clause.24

On the same day, Federal Judge Eric Komitee denied a TRO to the Diocese of Brooklyn in a similar lawsuit. Judge Komitee made it clear that Governor Cuomo’s Executive Order was aimed at the Orthodox Jewish synagogues in particular when he wrote,

This Emergency Order, as noted above, contains provision made expressly to houses of worship. Second, the Governor of New York made remarkably clear that this Order was intended to target a different set of religious institutions. See “Governor Cuomo is a Guest on CNN Newsroom with Poppy Harlow and Jimmy Sciutto,” October 9, 2020… “[T]he cluster is a predominantly ultra-Orthodox (Hasidic) community…[T]he issue is with that ultra-Orthodox community.” 25

Despite the mounting evidence that the Order was geared towards and motivated by the Orthodox Jewish community, Governor Cuomo denied that this was a matter of religious freedom.26

Agudath Israel has filed an appeal and a hearing date has been set for Nov. 3, 2020.27

Hospital Staff Sensor ID Badges Track COVID-19,"Story Highlights Sensor technology has been used by hospitals to monitor hand-washing behaviors and keep track of expensive equipment, but the coronavirus pandemic has opened up a new application for contact tracing of COVID-19 cases.

Adding a sensor to staff ID badges, medical technology company SwipeSense enables hospitals to monitor employee movements, document interaction with potential COVID-19 cases and subsequently identify contacts of COVID-19 positive cases.

Despite intentions for providing valuable information, the technology also has an inherent potential for abuse of security and personal privacy.

Seeking new ways to rapidly identify and contain cases of COVID-19, some hospitals are using existing sensor technology that has been repurposed to facilitate contact tracing of staff members inside the hospital.1 Prior to the arrival of COVID-19, hospitals were using the sensors, provided by Chicago-based medical technology company SwipeSense, to monitor such best-care medical practices as frequency of hand washing and consistency of bedside visits to patients, as well as to keep track of—and avoid theft of—expensive medical equipment.

Cloud-Based Sensor Network Tracks Movements of Hospital Workers

The SwipeSense system is a cloud-based network connecting individual sensors to a communication hub that can transmit data-tracking activity by department, unit or individual.2 The system works via unique identifiers that are clipped to a health care worker’s ID badge. As the worker goes about his or her day, the sensor collects data from other sensors embedded in equipment or at hygiene stations, tracking how many times the individual enters a given patient’s room or accesses hand-washing equipment.

Hand hygiene has been recognized as a critical practice for preventing hospital-acquired infections (HAI). However, monitoring of individual hand-washing behavior has been approached cautiously, with managers stressing the goal of solving barriers to good hand-washing practices rather than punishing underperformers. There are any number of legitimate reasons a staff member may fail to wash hands upon entering a patient’s room, from lack of alcohol gel to carrying supplies or operating equipment that makes it difficult to always handwash first. As Klaus Nether, executive director of high reliability product delivery at the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare said, “You have to take the time to really understand it, because it is more complex than just reminding someone to wash their hands.”3

Repurposing Sensor Technology for Tracking COVID-19

Because of those types of privacy concerns, SwipeSense had avoided using their technology for individual tracking application, until the coronavirus pandemic set in.4 When hospitals began reporting that staff were contracting COVID-19, SwipeSense’s chief executive Mert Iseri realized sensors added to ID badges could be used to track the movements of individual workers in the hospital, documenting potential COVID-19 exposures and subsequently identifying any contacts associated with positive COVID-19 cases.

Contact tracing is a standard epidemiological disease control tool used to track and notify anyone who may have been in contact with someone diagnosed with an infectious disease. In the case of the SwipeSense badges, the population being tracked is limited to a hospital setting rather than covering a geographic area.

Clifford Daniels, senior vice president and chief strategy officer at Methodist Hospital of Southern California, one of the hospitals currently using the SwipeSense badges, is hoping the sensor technology will monitor COVID-19 infections among staff members and also reassure patients about the safety of coming back into the hospital. With hospitals losing significant income over delays in elective and non-emergency procedures during the pandemic,5 Daniels said, “We’re hoping to get across that the hospital is as safe a place as it can be and that we’re doing everything we can to help contain the spread of COVID-19.”

Sensor Tracking Used in Illinois Hospital

One of the first hospitals to embrace the tracking system is Edward-Elmhurst Health in Illinois, where 3,600 hospital workers, doctors and nurses agreed to try using the sensor-embedded badges. When one patient unexpectedly tested positive for COVID-19, the surveillance team was able to determine the number of people who had been in that patient’s room. The 75 employees identified as being at risk were asked to be tested and to self-isolate for 72 hours. One contact employee tested positive, but isolation kept the virus from spreading further.

Crediting the technology as well as other infection control practices, the hospital has reduced its rate of positive COVID-19 testing among staff from 17 per cent at its peak in March to less than one percent by June.

Some of the hospital staff expressed concerns that the information gathered could be used to monitor break times and productivity. However, the hospital’s Chief Data Analytics Officer Raj Iyer stressed that the hospital only wanted to use the system to catch COVID-19 cases, not to monitor employee movements. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the inherent risks of using tools to monitor people, cautioning that “these kinds of tools can always get into the wrong hands… we have to be really thoughtful about the technology we’re building.”

AAP Wants Children Enrolled in COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Trials,"The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is asking federal officials to include children in COVID-19 vaccine trials.1 On September 29, 2020, Sara Goza, MD, president of the AAP, wrote a letter addressed to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Steven Hahn, MD stating, “Children must be included in vaccine trials to best understand any potential unique immune responses and/or unique safety concerns.”2

Currently, none of the COVID-19 vaccines in clinical development are being tested in children under the age of 18 years.3

The letter goes on to state, “It would also be less than desirable to have one or more SARS-CoV-2 vaccines licensed or available under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) at a time when no data have been collected on the safety, tolerability, dose, and regimen for children.”4

The AAP is also asking federal officials to include individuals in the trials who reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the U.S. population and include pregnant women and individuals with underlying poor health conditions.5

AAP Blames Mistrust of COVID-19 Vaccines on Anti-Vaccination Movement

In the letter to HHS and the FDA, AAP officials blame the “vocal, well-established and growing anti-vaccination movement” for spreading “fear mistrust and misinformation” about COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The letter states:

Unfortunately, fear, mistrust, and misinformation about a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is being spread from a vocal, well-established, and growing anti-vaccination movement. For a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be effective in controlling the pandemic, it must not only be safe and effective, but must also be embraced by medical providers and the public. For this to occur, Americans must have trust and confidence in the processes by which these vaccines are being tested for both safety and efficacy, and in the transparency of the scientific basis for licensure and recommendations for use. If that trust is jeopardized, mistrust of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines could become widespread and result not only in reduced uptake of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines but also in decreased confidence in all vaccines.6

Pfizer Submits Amended Protocol to FDA to Include Children in Clinical Trials

On Sept. 12, 2020, Pfizer, Inc. of New York City, New York and BioNTech SE of Mainz, Germany announced that they had submitted an amended protocol to the FDA to expand the enrollment of their Phase 3 pivotal COVID-19 vaccine trial to include approximately 44,000 participants, which also allows for the enrollment of new types of populations.7

The proposed expansion would allow the companies to increase trial population diversity and include adolescents as young as 16 years of age and people with chronic, stable HIV (human immunodeficiency viruses), Hepatitis C or Hepatitis B infection, as well as provide additional safety and efficacy data.8

Coronavirus Cases Plummet When PCR Tests Are Adjusted,"Health experts now say that PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus associated with the illness COVID-19, is too sensitive and needs to be adjusted to rule out people who have insignificant amounts of the virus in their system.1 The test’s threshold is so high that it detects people with the live virus as well as those with a few genetic fragments left over from a past infection that no longer poses a risk. It’s like finding a hair in a room after a person left it, says Michael Mina, MD, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.2

In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of people testing positive carried barely any virus, a review by The New York Times found.3

Manufacturers and Labs Set Criteria for Positive COVID-19 Test Results

The reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test used to identify those people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses a nasal swab to collect RNA from deep within the nasal cavity of the individual being tested. The RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA and amplified through 40 or more cycles, or until virus is detected.4 The result is reported as a simple “yes” or “no” answer to the question of whether someone is infected.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials state they do not specify the cycle threshold ranges used to determine who is positive, and that commercial manufacturers and laboratories set their own threshold ranges.5

PCR Test Threshold for COVID-19 Positivity Is Too Sensitive

Any test with a cycle threshold (CT) above 35 is too sensitive, says Juliet Morrison, PhD, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. “I’m shocked that people would think that 40 [cycles] could represent a positive.” A more reasonable cutoff would be 30 to 35, she added. Dr. Mina said he would set the figure at 30, or even less. Those changes would mean the amount of genetic material in a patient’s sample would have to be 100-fold to 1,000-fold that of the current standard for the test to return a positive result worth acting on.6

The CDC’s own calculations suggest that it is extremely difficult to detect any live virus in a sample above a threshold of 33 cycles.7

“We’ve been using one type of data for everything, and that is just plus or minus—that’s all,” Dr. Mina said. “We’re using that for clinical diagnostics, for public health, for policy decision-making.” But “yes” or “no” isn’t good enough, he added. It’s the amount of virus that should dictate the infected patient’s next steps. “It’s really irresponsible, I think, to forgo the recognition that this is a quantitative issue,” Dr. Mina said.8

The number of people with positive results who aren’t infectious is particularly concerning, said Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. “That worries me a lot, just because it’s so high,” he said.9

SARS-CoV-2 Positive Case Numbers Drop When Cycle Threshold is Adjusted, Removing Need for Contact Tracing

Officials at the Wadsworth Center, New York’s state lab, have access to CT values from tests they have processed, and analyzed their numbers at The Times’s request. In July, the lab identified 872 positive tests, based on a threshold of 40 cycles. With a cutoff of 35 cycles, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30.

In Massachusetts, from 85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of 40 would have been deemed negative if the threshold were 30 cycles, Dr. Mina said. “I would say that none of those people should be contact-traced, not one,” he said.

“I’m really shocked that it could be that high—the proportion of people with high CT value results,” said Ashish Jha, MD, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “Boy, does it really change the way we need to be thinking about testing.”10

“Gold Standard” PCR Tests Leave Many Unanswered Questions Due to Knowledge Gaps

A positive PCR test does not tell doctors whether the person is currently ill or will become ill in the future, whether they are infectious or will become infectious, whether they are recovered or recovering from COVID, or whether the PCR test identified a viral fragment from another coronavirus infection in the past. The CDC reports that a person who has recovered from COVID-19 may have low levels of virus in their bodies for up to three months after diagnosis and may test positive, even though they are not spreading COVID-19.11

CT Value Adds Context to PCR Results, Personalizes Care

Although the cycle threshold (CT) is not reported on PCR tests, new evidence suggests the CT value could help to better inform clinical decisions, particularly when testing in the absence of symptoms for COVID-19. When SARS-CoV-2 virus is detected after fewer amplification cycles, that indicates a higher viral load and a higher likelihood of being contagious, while virus detected after more amplifications indicates a lower viral load.

“It’s just kind of mind-blowing to me that people are not recording the CT values from all these tests—that they’re just returning a positive or a negative,” said Angela Rasmussen, PhD, a virologist at Columbia University in New York. “It would be useful information to know if somebody’s positive, whether they have a high viral load or a low viral load,” she added.12

In a study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in May, 2020,13 the authors suggested that viral load based on CT cutoff could establish whether inpatients have transmissible disease or need to be retested. This would conserve valuable testing capacity, reagents, and personal protective equipment (PPE), and determine when a patient could discontinue isolation. Taking the CT value into account may also help justify symptom-based strategies recommended by the CDC. CT values may enable contact tracers to focus only on persons most likely to be infectious, which will become increasingly important as asymptomatic screening expands.

Another study14 found that patients with positive PCR tests at a CT above 33-34 are not contagious and can be discharged from the hospital or strict confinement at home.

Evidence from both viral isolation and contact tracing studies supports a short, early period of transmissibility. By accounting for the CT value in context, RT-qPCR results can be used in a way that is personalized, highly sensitive, and more specific.15

FDA Approves Rapid, Less Sensitive Coronavirus Antigen Test

Highly sensitive PCR tests seemed like the best option for tracking the coronavirus at the start of the pandemic. But for the outbreaks raging now, Dr. Mina said, what’s needed are coronavirus tests that are fast, cheap and abundant enough to frequently test everyone who needs it—even if the tests are less sensitive. “It might not catch every last one of the transmitting people, but it sure will catch the most transmissible people, including the super spreaders.”

The FDA noted that people may have a low viral load when they are newly infected. A test with less sensitivity would miss these infections. That problem is easily solved, Dr. Mina said: “Test them again, six hours later or 15 hours later or whatever,” he said. A rapid test would find these patients quickly, even if it were less sensitive, because their viral loads would quickly rise. People infected with the virus are most infectious from a day or two before symptoms appear till about five days after. But at the current testing rates, “you’re not going to be doing it frequently enough to have any chance of really capturing somebody in that window,” Dr. Mina added.16

When a patient is tested for the coronavirus, doctors typically tell them to stay home until the results come in. If a patient tests positive and faces a two-week quarantine, that means they could spend a total of three weeks in isolation. That’s a long time for anybody who has bills to pay or kids to care for, and it’s understandable that some people will continue working until the results come in. The problem is that anybody who does this with a serious infection is putting others at risk.17 Rapid tests can be helpful in these situations.

In late August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first rapid coronavirus test that doesn’t need any special computer equipment. Made by Abbot Laboratories, the 15-minute test will sell for U.S. $5 but still requires a nasal swab to be taken by a health worker.18 The Abbot test is the fourth rapid point-of-care test that looks for the presence of antigens rather than the virus’s genetic code as the PCR molecular tests do. 19

DC Bill B23-0171 Allowing Children 11 Years and Older to Be Vaccinated Without Parental Knowledge or Consent Advances,"Opinion | On Oct. 7, 2020, during a hastily scheduled virtual meeting,1 four District of Columbia Council members making up the Health Committee2 amended and unanimously passed a minor consent bill, B23-0171.3 The bill would not only permit children aged 11 years and older to give consent for doctors and other vaccine administrators to give them vaccines without their parents’ knowledge or consent, but would also require insurance companies, vaccine administrators and schools to conceal from parents that the child has been vaccinated.

On Oct. 20, 2020,4 the entire DC Council voted in favor of the bill 12:15 on the first reading in yet another virtual online meeting6 with no public testimony. It was announced that the second reading, which will be the final vote, will take place on Nov. 10, 2020.7

Committee Chair and Bill Sponsor Admit “Imminent” COVID-19 Vaccine is Reason for Sudden Push to Eliminate Parental Rights

NVIC issued an alert8 through the online NVIC Advocacy Portal when the bill had it’s first public hearing in June of 2019 advising opposition to the bill, which violated parental medical informed consent rights. Testimony was taken,9 and NVIC submitted testimony against the bill.10 B23-0171 then sat for over a year untouched and unmoved.

In a revealing statement Vincent C. Gray (D-Ward 7), the chair of the DC Health Committee which passed the bill, explained why the bill was all suddenly being revived and pushed through so quickly. Gray was quoted in The Washington Post as saying, “the hope of an imminent corona­virus vaccine gave the bill new urgency.”11

Primary sponsor of this bill, DC Council Member Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), emphasized that coronavirus vaccines were her the main reason why she wants to remove parents from the process of vaccinating children. Advocating for passage of her bill, she stated:

And given our ongoing pandemic and the incredible work being done to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, it’s more important than ever I think that we reduce any and all barriers to these treatments and this legislation aims to do just that by increasing access to vaccines for minors who choose to get vaccinated but have not been able to do so.12

If this bill passes, it is clear that minor children will be at risk of being pressured and coerced into getting a COVID-19 vaccine behind their parents’ back once it is available and added by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to the childhood vaccine schedule recommended by the U,S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) .

Violation of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act and Parental Rights

B23-0171 permits minor children 11 years and older to consent to any vaccine recommended by ACIP without a parent’s knowledge or consent (bill lines 27-30).

Federal legislative history provides evidence that Congress never intended for a minor child to make decisions to get a vaccine without parents’ knowledge or consent. When the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 198613 was passed, the Act clearly stated that before the administration of vaccines14 to a child, a health care provider shall give a copy of the CDC’s vaccine information materials to the, “parent or legal representative of any child to whom the provider intends to administer such vaccine…”

The CDC confirms that there is a requirement that their Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) is provided to the parent/legal guardian prior to vaccination of a minor child on their VIS Q&A page.15 Under the question, “Is there a requirement to verify that parents/legal representatives have actually received and reviewed the VIS,” the answer is a clear “YES”.

These requirements under federal law for a parent to be educated with CDC materials prior to their minor child being vaccinated will not be met if a child is allowed to make these decisions on their own.

The United States Supreme Court has recognized the right of parents to be an active and integral part of their children’s lives as “perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by [the Supreme] Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (U.S. 2000)16

B23-0171 Endangers the Health and Well Being of Children

A minor child is far less likely than an adult parent to understand personal and family medical history, including vaccine reactions, allergies, and autoimmune or neurological disorders.

Children do not have the same kind of critical thinking skills or emotional maturity required to make a well-informed vaccine benefit-risk decision compared to an adult. Vaccines can cause injury and death as evidenced by the creation of a federally operated Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which has paid out over $4.4 billion dollars to vaccine victims.17

If a child consents to vaccination without their parent knowledge and has a reaction, the parent may not recognize vaccine reaction symptoms and the reason for their child’s sudden personality change and decline in physical, mental or emotional health, and this lack of knowledge could be life threatening for the child. The parent’s lack of knowledge about the fact that their child was given vaccines that carry a risk of injury or death may well prevent the parent from seeking immediate medical care.

Under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act18 Congress gave partial liability protection to vaccine manufacturers in 1986 and then added an amendment giving vaccine administrators liability protection from vaccine injury lawsuits in 1987. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court judges in Bruesewitz et al v. Wyeth et al19 affirmed that government licensed and recommended childhood vaccines were “unavoidably unsafe” and effectively removed all remaining liability from vaccine manufacturers. Today, pharmaceutical companies making and selling vaccines and doctors and other vaccine administrators have no legal accountability or financial liability in civil court when a mandated vaccine causes permanent injury or death.

There is no justification for the state to eliminate a parent’s legal and moral right to make an informed benefit and risk decision about vaccination on behalf of a minor child, especially when doctors and other vaccine providers have no liability or accountability for what happens to the child after vaccination.

Violates Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)20

B23-0171 compels schools (bill lines 52-54) to conceal vaccine administration from parents, whose children give consent to receive vaccinations on their own, even when their parents have already declined one or more vaccines for health risk reasons or have filed a religious vaccine exemption.

FERPA, 34 CFR § 99.1021, guarantees parents the right to have access to their children’s education records. The definition of “education records” include health and vaccine records at the K-12 level22.

While B23-0171 blocks parents from getting access to their child’s vaccination status, the bill does permit schools to share the child’s vaccination record with the DC Department of Health or the school-based health center (bill lines 53-54).

This is also in conflict with FERPA because 34 CFR §99.30 requires prior written parental consent before personally identifiable information (PII) is disclosed to others and requires schools to provide copies of those records disclosed.23 While FERPA does allow for release of PII under the health and safety emergency exception, the release of information that personally identifies the student is extremely limited.24

Bill Conflicts With Religious Exemption, Requires Falsification of Records

Section 5300.11 of the DC Municipal Regulations states, “The immunization requirements subject to this Chapter, shall not apply to any student whose parent or guardian objects in writing to the immunization on grounds that the medical treatment or medical test is forbidden by their religion or religious beliefs and practices25.”

Granting vaccine providers the ability to vaccinate children in the absence of parental consent conflicts with the already codified religious exemption rights of parents.

There are other serious legal issues creating the potential for criminal violations and civil liability lawsuits: the bill requires vaccine providers and insurers to conceal the fact that the child was vaccinated and it requires the falsification of official medical records by vaccine administrators.

The bill (lines 37-41) requires providers to seek reimbursement from the parent’s insurance company but prohibits insurers from sending an Explanation of Benefits.

DC Vaccine Bill Part of the Dangerous Agenda To Remove Parents From Vaccination Decisions for Minor Children

Congress held two vaccine hearings on Feb. 2726 and Mar. 5, 2019.27 The hearings, which focused on vaccine hesitancy, pitted children against their parents.

Veteran vaccine safety and informed consent advocates with decades of experience, including time spent serving as consumer representatives on federal advisory committees, were denied the ability to testify. However, a teenager, who had no expertise in the area of vaccine safety and law and whose only experience related to the subject being discussed was recently criticizing his mother on social media28 for not vaccinating him, was invited to testify.29

After the hearing, the mainstream media published multiple similar articles promoting the ill-conceived concept of doctors being given the power to convince minor children to receive vaccines without their parents’ consent, often quoting the teen’s testimony as justification for why parents should be cut out of the vaccination process for their minor children.30 Medical trade groups representing liability-free vaccine administrators also endorsed the concept of giving children liability free vaccines without parental consent.

Doctors, who are frustrated with having to spend time talking with educated parents about vaccines, have identified minor consent as a way to coerce children into consenting to vaccines on their own. Pre-adolescents and teenagers are vulnerable to peer and authority-figure persuasion. An opinion piece expressing support for removing parental informed consent rights was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 31 and the American Medical Association passed a resolution supporting state laws to allow minors to consent to vaccination.32

This coordinated effort resulted in 13 minor consent bills being introduced in state legislatures in 2019, and there was a big jump to 21 similar bills being introduced in 2020.

Legislators listened to parents and rejected a total of 33 minor consent bills filed in 2019 and 2020. The DC minor consent bill in is the only one moving.33

What Happens if the Bill Passes on November 10th?

If the bill passes a second reading in the City Council, it goes to the DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has up to 10 days to sign the bill, let it go into effect without her signature, or veto it. If Mayor Bowser vetoes the bill, the City Council can override the veto by a two-thirds vote.

The final step before becoming law is the bill must be sent to the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate for a period of 30 days before becoming effective as law. During this period of review, the U.S. Congress may enact into law a joint resolution disapproving and negating the legislation. If, during the review period, the President of the United States approves a joint resolution by Congress disapproving the DC legislation, it will be prevented from becoming law. If, however, upon the expiration of the congressional review period, no joint resolution disapproving the Council’s Act has been approved by the President, the bill finally becomes a law and is assigned a law number.34

Litigation is also likely if the DC Council passes B23-0171. In an Oct. 21, 2020 update by ParentalRights.org, “DC Council Would Discard Constitution, End Parents’ Rights,” Executive Director Michael Ramey asserts this bill is contrary to the U.S. Constitution and lays out existing U.S. Supreme Court precedent to back this up. He says, “For nearly 100 years, consistent Supreme Court precedent has held that parents have both the duty and the right to direct the care, custody, and control of their minor children.”35

What Can People Do To Help Defeat This Legislation?

Families living or sending their children to school in the District of Columbia should contact all thirteen members of the DC Council36 and tell them to Vote NO on B23-0171 in the second and final reading. Specific directions, talking points, and contact information is published in the alert on the NVIC Advocacy Portal.

Everyone else can help get this information to people they know in DC. NVIC anticipates that there will be similar minor consent bills filed in other states in 2021. Registered users of the free online NVIC Advocacy Portal will receive action alerts with talking points when vaccine related bills like this one are introduced in 2021 so they can take action in their own states to protect their informed consent rights.

Massachusetts Public Health Officials Require Annual Flu Shots for Child Care and All Grades Through College,"On Aug. 19, 2020, Massachusetts public health officials announced that all children six months of age and older who are attending child care, pre-school, kindergarten, K-12 and colleges and universities in Massachusetts will be required to get the influenza vaccine “to reduce flu-related illness and ​the overall impact of respiratory illness during the COVID-19 pandemic.”1 Although as of August 2020, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York City require annual flu shots for children enrolled in child care and pre-K school, Massachusetts is the first state to also require influenza vaccinations for all students attending kindergarten, primary and secondary schools and colleges and universities.

Deadline to Get the Influenza Vaccine is December 31, 2020

Students in Massachusetts will be required to show proof of influenza vaccination by Dec. 31, 2020 for the 2020/2021 influenza season to attend child care or school unless a valid medical or religious exemption is provided.2 Exempt from this requirement are K-12 students who are homeschooled and higher education students who do not go on campus and are engaged in distance education only.3

This new vaccination requirement to register for school in January 2020 is in addition to existing vaccine requirements recommended by the U.S. Center for Control and Disease Preventions’ (CDC) Childhood Vaccination Schedule for all those students attending childcare, preschool, K-12, and colleges and universities in Massachusetts.4

Students Educated at Home During Pandemic Not Exempted

Elementary and secondary students in districts and schools that are participating in remote education at home during the coronavirus pandemic declaration are not exempt from the annual flu shot requirement.5 The parents of approximately 30 percent of public school students have opted for their children to participate in at-home remote-only learning, raising questions about how school district officials plan to enforce the vaccine requirement for students who are not attending classes in schools but are being educated at home.6

For adult college and university students, the influenza vaccination requirement applies to all full-time undergraduate and graduate students under 30 years of age and all full-time and part-time health science students. The requirement includes foreign students attending or visiting classes or educational programs in Massachusetts as part of an academic visitation or exchange program. The only exception is for college and university students who exclusively attend classes online and never visit the campus in person. College students who attend any classes or activities on campus, even once, must be vaccinated by Dec. 31, 2020.7

Marylou Sudders, Secretary of Health and Human Services for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, said the requirement will extend beyond the coronavirus pandemic declaration and be permanent in the future, requiring all students from day care enrollment to graduation from college to get influenza vaccines annually.8

Public Health Officials Say Flu Shot Mandate Justified by Fears of COVID-19 Surge in The Fall

Massachusetts public health officials say that the new influenza vaccine requirement is a result of their concern that infection rates of COVID-19 may surge again in the fall when more schools and businesses reopen in the state. They fear that concurrent outbreaks of influenza and COVID-19 could overwhelm the state’s health care system and maintain that, by requiring annual influenza vaccines for all students, it will ease the potential burden on the state’s health care system by decreasing influenza cases. They argue that giving annual flu shots to all children and students from six months old through college age will allow health care workers to spend less time trying to figure out whether symptoms such as fevers and coughs are influenza cases or COVID-19 cases.9

According to Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, “I would hope people would understand this is an important part of how we continue to fight the coronavirus here in Massachusetts. The more people who get the flu shot don’t get the flu and don’t wind up in the ER.”10

Massachusetts Residents Protest Against Government Overreach

In response to the influenza vaccine requirement, parents in Massachusetts are protesting the new law. They cite the well-known poor effectiveness of influenza vaccine that has been acknowledged by federal public health officials for many years, with vaccine effectiveness ranging from 10 to 60 percent since 2004.11

According to a parent Jennifer Gaskin of Worcester, Massachusetts, “I understand why this mandate was put in place given the current pandemic and potential impact on hospitals. However, I think it is morally wrong to take away the right to a choice for parents for a vaccination that has minimal efficacy in most cases.”12

She adds that, “This is a very slippery slope and raises concerns that we may be further mandated to give our children the COVID-19 vaccine, which would not have been fully tested prior to release. We wouldn’t know long-term effects or anything based on the proposed timelines.”13

Candice Edwards, executive director of Health Choice 4 Action Massachusetts who has been leading lobbying efforts in opposition to bills relating to vaccines and exemptions, said that medical decisions should be made by a patient or parent and a physician, not by public health officials. Health Choice 4 Action Massachusetts said the organization will be signing a petition to repeal the annual influenza vaccination requirement for all children attending child care and schools in the state.14

"A New Movie 1986: the Act Reveals Fraud, Cover-up of DPT Risks","Film director Andy Wakefield has released a movie online, 1986: the Act, which reveals the fraud and cover-up of DPT vaccine risks by the pharmaceutical industry and federal agencies that led to the passage and eventual destruction of the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act and a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision, which removed all civil liability from vaccine manufacturers. The audience is taken on a journey of discovery through the eyes of a young couple about to have their first child. Legal documents and interviews with attorneys, historians, bioethicists, parents of vaccine injured children, journalists, doctors and activists give context and historical perspective to current events related to the coronavirus pandemic and the fast tracking to licensure of liability-free COVID-19 vaccines that will be mandated for children and adults.

On the website of 1986: the Act, the film is described as:

Man and microbe, from Polio to COVID-19… a never more relevant forensic examination of the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act and its consequences. What happens when an ancient wisdom—a mother’s intuition—is pitted against powerful interests in a race against time?

A Very Dangerous Place: Mandating Unsafe, Liability-Free Products

In a July 2020 podcast interview with Benjamin Benulis, DC, film director Andy Wakefield said:

This film is an astonishing untold story of what I believe to be the core of all the problems that we face with vaccines worldwide at the moment because when you take an industry and a product and you take it outside the constraints of the free market, then you are in a very dangerous place. When you give indemnification to the vaccine manufacturers for damage done by their products, there is no incentive for safety… Then when you mandate these faulty, unsafe products for every child in the country and, by extension, to every child in the world, then you have a disastrous situation.

Industry and Government Destroy the Act

Wakefield said that the film explains how, after the Act was passed by Congress in 1986, it was destroyed by industry and government:

What happened next is even worse and that is the federal agencies and the industry conspired to sabotage, to disable checks and balances that Congress had put in place to make vaccines safer: the reporting system for adverse events [and] the compensation of children, the degree to which the parents had to prove causation. The entire infrastructure crumbled and parents were left naked, on their own, to deal with this system. When you do this, when you make the industry so powerful, so rich that they can buy politicians worldwide, they can buy doctors worldwide, then it owns everything. And that is an exquisitely dangerous situation.

An Affirmation of Maternal Intuition

Wakefield describes the film as not only an expose of fraud and corruption of a wealthy and powerful industry but also an affirmation of the power of maternal intuition:

The story is about the extraordinary power of maternal intuition, that’s what it really comes down to, and this is not an emotional argument. This is a survival imperative. It’s the ability of mothers that has evolved over thousands and thousands and thousands of years to know instinctively, intrinsically, when their child is well and when they are ill, what is right and what is wrong… at the end of it all [the film], it is saying to people, saying to mothers, that there is an inner authority that you need to defer to, not an external authority. You need to trust that because it is the reason we are here on this earth right now—not because of men in white coats, not because of vaccines or antibiotics, but because intuitively you knew what to do and how to do it. And that is the truth. And when people wake up literally and collectively to that notion and take back that power, give themselves that inner authority, then we’re going to see change.

Relevance During COVID-19 Pandemic

Because the film educates the public about the social, political and economic underpinnings of the vaccination system, Wakefield said that the film helps people understand events that are taking place today during the COVID-19 pandemic:",2020-08-10 18:47:04+00:00,,0
Only Half of Americans Polled Say They Would Get COVID-19 Vaccine,"In a poll conducted for CNN during Oct. 1-4, 2020, the Pennsylvania-based market research firm SSRS found that 51 percent of the 1,205 Americans surveyed said they would try to get a COVID-19 vaccine if it were widely available at a low cost, 45 percent said they would not and four percent had no opinion. Sixty percent of respondents 65 years of age and older said to they would get a new COVID-19 vaccine, while 49 percent of those under 45 said they would try to get vaccinated.1 2 3 4

Poll responses also varied depending on gender and race. Of the men surveyed, 58 percent said they would try to get a COVID-19 vaccine, while only 45 percent of women said they would try.1 2 3 4

CNN polls conducted in May and August showed 66 percent and 56 percent respectively of those surveyed said they would try to get a COVID-19 vaccine, reflecting a steady downward trend. The May and August polls also shows that the percentage of respondents saying they would not try to get a COVID-19 vaccine has steadily increased. In May, 33 percent of those polled said they would not get a COVID-19 vaccine, while in August the percentage rose to 40 percent.5

Other Polls Have Shown Even Less Interest in Getting COVID-19 Vaccine

Other polls conducted by other market research firms on behalf of other news outlets have shown even less willingness on the part of Americans to get a COVID-19 vaccine. In a poll of 2,493 U.S registered voters conducted last month for CBS News, pollster YouGov found only 21 percent of of those surveyed said they would get a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available, even if it is offered for free.6

Consistently, “the number of Americans willing to get a new vaccine against COVID-19 has been falling since polling began,” noted staff writer Kate Raines of The Vaccine Reaction in a recent article.6 Raines wrote:

In April/May, a poll of 1,056 adults conducted by the Associated Press’s NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed that 49 percent said they planned to get vaccinated as soon as a vaccine was licensed, 20 percent said they would not get the new vaccine and 31 percent were unsure. Morning Consult poll numbers from May showed an even higher number of respondents planning to get a new vaccine: 59 percent among 2,200 surveys of U.S. adults, with 14 percent saying they would not want the vaccine and 22 percent unsure. By late July, polls showed the number of people who would accept a newly licensed COVID-19 vaccine had dropped to 32 percent, with 17 percent against taking any coronavirus vaccine approved this year and 51 percent taking a “wait and see” stance.6

Polls indicate that many Americans are concerned about safety, while others are not sure a COVID-19 vaccine would protect them from the mutated coronavirus.6

Polls Find Many Americans Do Not Want COVID-19 Vaccine as Soon as...,"Story Highlights More adults in the U.S. are expressing doubts about the safety of a newly licensed COVID-19 vaccine that might become available this year.

The number of poll respondents planning on getting a new coronavirus vaccine as soon as it is FDA approved has fallen from a reported high of 50 to 60 percent down to 21 percent currently.

Reduced trust in the fast-tracked vaccine process mirrors generally reduced trust in COVID-19 information being disseminated by public health officials and mainstream media.

As medical doctors and government health officials warn that there can be no return to normal until we have an effective COVID-19 vaccine that everyone uses, more and more Americans are expressing skepticism about accepting a newly licensed coronavirus vaccine that has been rushed through the approval process. In a poll of 2,493 registered U.S. voters across the country conducted on behalf of CBS News, only 21 percent of voters are still saying they would get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as one becomes available, even if it is free.1

That same poll showed that two thirds of voters say they would not consider a vaccine made available this year as a scientific breakthrough (65 percent) but rather as one that had been “rushed through without enough testing” (35 percent). Among those who feel the vaccine testing has been rushed, only 13 percent say they would get the vaccine as soon as it was available.

Decreasing Trust in Fast-Tracked Vaccine Safety

The number of Americans willing to get a new vaccine against COVID-19 has been falling since polling began. In April/May, a poll of 1,056 adults conducted by the Associated Press’s NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed that 49 percent said they planned to get vaccinated as soon as a vaccine was licensed, 20 percent said they would not get the new vaccine and 31 percent were unsure.2 Morning Consult poll numbers from May showed an even higher number of respondents planning to get a new vaccine: 59 percent among 2,200 surveys of U.S. adults, with 14 percent saying they would not want the vaccine and 22 percent unsure.3 4

By late July, polls showed the number of people who would accept a newly licensed COVID-19 vaccine had dropped to 32 percent, with 17 percent against taking any coronavirus vaccine approved this year and 51 percent taking a “wait and see” stance.5 Most of those who have expressed reluctance about getting a new COVID-19 vaccine are concerned about safety and side effects, while others are uncertain a vaccine would be effective in protecting them from the mutated coronavirus.6

Polls results seem to indicate that there are divisions within political parties, with more registered Democrats viewing a new vaccine as being inappropriately rushed to market (77 percent) rather than a scientific achievement (23 percent) compared to Republicans (48 and 52 percent, respectively). Though more Republicans than Democrats plan to get the vaccine if one becomes available, most plan to wait or forego the vaccine altogether.7

Trust in Public Health Information Also on the Decline

That same CBS poll shows that voters as a whole have less trust in the coronavirus information provided by public health authorities, such as officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the President of the United States, state governors and the national media, compared to opinions reported earlier in the pandemic.8 Most dramatically, trust in the CDC to provide accurate information about COVID-19 has fallen from a high of 86 percent in March to 54 percent today.9

Also since March, trust in information provided by the national media has fallen from 45 percent to 35 percent currently. Trust in information disseminated by state governors has also fallen by 14 percentage points.10

Regardless of party, the majority of voters—65 percent of Republicans, 84 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Independents—agree that whomever is elected president should publicly be vaccinated to demonstrate confidence in the safety of a new COVID-19 vaccine recommended by the government.11

Makers of Experimental COVID-19 Vaccines Lobby EU for Liability...,"Vaccines Europe, a pharmaceutical industry lobbying group, has issued a memo to its member companies saying it would seek liability protection from the European Union (EU) for corporations manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines. The memo, obtained by the Financial Times, expressed concern about the “inevitable risks” of rushing the development and global marketing of COVID-19 vaccines.1 2 3 According to the document:

The speed and scale of development and rollout do mean that it is impossible to generate the same amount of underlying evidence that normally would be available through extensive clinical trials and healthcare providers building experience.

Vaccines Europe added that for this reason it will advocate for a “comprehensive no-fault and non-adversarial compensation system, and an exemption from civil liability.” The memo acknowledged that some people will likely suffer “adverse events” after receiving COVID-19 vaccines and that, given the large number of people who will get the vaccines, this might lead to “numerous damage claims.”1 2 3

The precedent that such liability protection would set worries Yannis Natsis, a patient representative on the management board of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). “This kind of discussion around giving companies a free pass, this undermines patient safety and confidence in vaccines,” Natsis said.4

On Aug. 27, 2020, AstraZeneca signed a contract with the EU exempting the company from future liability claims in exchange for supplying EU countries with at least 300 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine by mid-2021.3 The Brussels Times reported:

In its current form, the [AstraZeneca] deal allows the multinational drugmaker to pass the hot potato of product liability onto national governments, leaving them exposed to the financial consequences of any potential side-effect claims.3

During negotiations leading up to the contract, Ruud Dober, a senior executive with AstraZeneca, said, “This is a unique situation where we as a company simply cannot take the risk if in four years the vaccine is showing side effects. Dober added, “In the contracts we have in place, we are asking for indemnification. For most countries it is acceptable to take that risk on their shoulders because it is in their national interest.”5 6

AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford have been working to develop an experimental COVID-19 vaccine known as AZD1222 (formerly ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or “chimpanzee adenovirus Oxford 1” novel coronavirus-19).7 On Aug. 15, 2002, the results of a Phase I/II human clinical trial for AZD1222 were published in The Lancet. The trial involved 1,077 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 55 years old and data showed that AZD1222 caused side effects—both local and systemic reactions—in approximately 60 percent of the trial participants.8 9

Vaccines Europe, which is a division of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, represent numerous major pharmaceutical companies, including Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca, CureVac, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novavax, Pfizer, Sanofi, Seqirus and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.2 10

Vitamin D Might Just Save You From Getting COVID-19,"A study conducted at the University of Chicago and published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association claims that vitamin D deficiency may have been factor in the infections of COVID-19 patients. In fact, patients that had a vitamin D deficiency or those whose deficiency were not treated were almost twice as likely to test positive for the coronavirus relative to those that had enough vitamin D. Why is this a major breakthrough? This means that those that are already vitamin D deficient, and this is a majority of the population by the way, may need only to take vitamin D supplements to boost their immune system to prevent from getting the coronavirus and successfully battle it if they’ve already been infected.",2020-11-03 15:17:49+00:00,,0
Half a Million Sharks Could Die to Produce Squalene Adjuvants for...,"Story Highlights A shark conservation group is calling for alternatives to using squalene harvested from the liver of sharks as an adjuvant in COVID-19 vaccine candidates.

Shark conservation advocates estimate that an additional 500,000 sharks will be killed every year should squalene adjuvanted coronavirus vaccines become licensed for global general use.

The group is asking pharmaceutical companies to explore more sustainable sources of squalene.

Shark Allies, a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of sharks and rays (such as sting and electric rays) in oceans, is concerned that the production of a COVID-19 vaccine on a global scale could eventually completely destroy shark populations worldwide.1 Several vaccine candidates currently being tested in human clinical trials require an ingredient known as squalene, harvested from the liver of sharks. As the race to produce a COVID-19 vaccine intensifies, shark populations could become potentially endangered if the demand for squalene increases.2

What is Squalene?

Squalene is a natural oil produced by plants, animals and humans. In humans, oil glands hydrate and maintain the skin barrier. The amount of squalene that bodies naturally produce decreases with age. Cosmetics, supplements and skin products include squalene as an ingredient to moisturize the skin, claiming that the ingredient slows down the aging of skin.3

Shark liver oil, which contains squalene, has been extracted from shark livers for use in the cosmetic industry, especially. Companies that producing cosmetics are heavily dependent on high yielding shark-based squalene for their products due to its cost–effectiveness. Squalene is a common ingredient in sunscreens, lipsticks, eye shadows, lotions and foundations.4

Squalene is also found in many plants, such as olives, sugarcane, rice bran, yeasts and wheat germ, but plant-derived squalene is significantly more expensive to produce than animal squalene.5

Squalene Used As An Adjuvant In Many Vaccines

Adjuvants are added to vaccines to provoke a strong pro-inflammatory immune response that produces a high amount of antibodies.6 Squalene has been used as an adjuvant in many vaccines, which include vaccines for Influenza A H1N1 (Swine Flu), Asian Avian Influenza H5N1, Influenza A H7N9, Influenza A H7N7, other influenza vaccines (e.g. Fluad), rabies vaccines and anthrax vaccines.7

The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) has pointed out that squalene adjuvants have not been tested compared to placebos in large trials and results published in scientific journals. In addition, there are no studies specifically evaluating cellular, molecular and DNA changes in the body after squalene-adjuvanted vaccines have been administered to children and adults.8

In a public comment in 2015, Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of NVIC said, “Squalene adjuvants hyper-stimulate the immune system and have been linked with development of autoimmunity, narcolepsy and other chronic disease.”9

Shark Allies Petitions Against Use of Shark Derived Squalene for COVID-19 Vaccines

Shark Allies point out that the MF59 adjuvant, which is an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene, is being used in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Currently, at least five COVID-19 vaccine candidates use adjuvants that are based on shark squalene, including those manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Seqirus/University of Queensland/CSL, Medicago, Inc. and Farmacologós eterinaries SAC/Universidad Peruana Cayetana Heredia.10

It is estimated that 2.7 million sharks are killed annually for squalene used in cosmetics. Shark Allies estimates projects that an additional 500,000 sharks would be killed if a COVID-19 vaccine containing shark squalene is approved for general use.11

Stephani Brendl, executive director of Shark Allies said, “The problem is that squalene, used as an ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine, will be seen as something that’s unavoidable, and then as it becomes tested, it becomes the normal ingredient, and nothing else will be tested.”12 She noted that pharmaceutical companies must explore more sustainable squalene alternatives such as olive oil, sugar cane, wheat germ, bacteria and yeast since they have an identical chemical nature to shark squalene.13 The issue lies in the fact that these options can be 30 percent more expensive and take much longer to extract than squalene from sharks.14

“Our ask is that we start testing the alternatives, because long term, we cannot rely on a wild animal resource for a global need of anything. They (sharks) keep our fish stock healthy, they keep the food chain intact, they keep diseases out of other animal populations. Good luck trying to replace that when we lose them,” Brenda said.15

NVIC’s Online Vaccine Conference Rebroadcast This Weekend by...,"There was a young man walking down a deserted beach just before dawn. In the distance he saw a frail old man. As he approached the old man, he saw him picking up stranded starfish and throwing them, one by one, back into the sea. The young man gazed in wonder as the old man, again and again, threw the small starfish from the sand and into the water. He asked, “Old man, why do you spend so much energy doing what seems to be a waste of time?” The old man explained that the stranded starfish would die if left in the morning sun. “But there must be thousands of beaches and millions of starfish!” exclaimed the young man. “How can you make any difference?” The old man looked at the small starfish in his hand and, as he threw it to the safety of the sea, he said, “It makes a difference to this one!” —Author Unknown

Thousands of people from the U.S. and other countries watched NVIC’s Fifth International Public Conference on Vaccination: Protecting Health and Autonomy in the 21st Century, which was broadcast online Oct. 16-18, 2020 featuring 51 speakers presenting information on vaccine science, policy, law, informed consent, holistic health and civil liberties. The positive response by viewers was so overwhelming, that NVIC is re-opening registrations and will re-broadcast the conference content this weekend, Oct. 23-25, 2020.

Cutting Edge Presentations on COVID-19, Vaccine Science, Human Rights

The three-day, three-night conference features cutting edge presentations by scientists, physicians, nurses, constitutional and civil rights attorneys, book authors, journalists, parents of vaccine injured children, community organizers, and human rights activists from the U.S., Canada and Europe. Presentations explore a wide range of topics being discussed in public forums today:

the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown regulations;

infectious diseases;

vaccine ingredients, risks and failures;

mandatory vaccination policies;

the 1986 Act and liability protection for vaccine manufacturers;

tactics used by the forced vaccination lobby;

defending the right to freedom of conscience;

protection of autonomy and bodily integrity;

how to be an effective vaccine choice advocate and much more.

What the Audience is Saying

Here are just a few early comments coming in from the audience who watched the conference this weekend and were inspired to offer feedback:

“Thank you for an amazing program so far! My husband and I have been glued to our laptops soaking in the information that the presenters are dishing out. We are bronze sponsors and will be able to go back to listen to the conference again… Thank you for standing up and being strong so that human rights are preserved! We love and appreciate you all!” “Thank you so much. This is the best conference… You guys are doing world saving work.” “Thank-you for pulling together an excellent conference with some great films and speakers! The hardest part is getting those who are in deep denial and don’t want to think about these topics to watch anything that is truly enlightening and transformative. I did learn a lot and was quite moved by the conference and so glad to know that I can find more people through the organizations that already exist to work with in my part of the world.” “Will you be posting Barbara Loe Fisher’s speech to your site? Please add my name to the list of thousands who thank her for her efforts and courage and pass this along to her.” “What an incredible conference you put together! As much as I would like to say that I enjoyed it, much of it stirred anger, sadness, disbelief and a slew of other emotions. But that is a good thing! Thank you for all you have done and continue to do at NVIC! The amount of change and the far reach you have all created is astounding and encouraging. As the last slide said (paraphrasing Ghandi)… good always prevails.” “Just finished watching your conference. THANK YOU for all your efforts. What an achievement! We will win this war.”

Zheng, who is leading China’s COVID-19 vaccine development task force, said the emergency use authorization was in line with Chinese vaccine law, which allows unapproved vaccine candidates to be used on people who are considered high-risk for a limited period.3

China has reportedly been administering experimental COVID-19 vaccines to high-risk individuals for over a month. Among those who have received experimental coronavirus vaccines include frontline health care workers, public service workers and border officials.4 Chinese pharmaceutical companies have also administered their experimental vaccines to their top executives and leading researchers.5

Thousands of COVID-19 Vaccinated Citizens Forced to Sign “Nondisclosure” Agreement

There are four COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by Chinese pharmaceutical companies that are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, which are mostly being conducted in United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Peru, Morocco, Argentina, Indonesia and Brazil. The Chinese government has approved three experimental coronavirus vaccines for emergency use that are currently being administered in China.6

State-owned Sinopharm, a Chinese pharmaceutical company, has reportedly given their experimental vaccine to 350,000 people. Sinovac Biotech Ltd., another Chinese pharmaceutical company, has administered its experimental vaccine to 90 percent of its employees and family members under the emergency-use provision and thousands of doses to employees of Beijing city government. The Chinese military has also approved the use of a vaccine it developed with CanSino Biologics, Inc., a Chinese biopharmaceutical company, for experimental use in military personnel.7

The Hindustan Times has reported that those getting these experimental vaccines are also made to sign a “nondisclosure agreement”, complying with nondisclosure of any details to the media.8 Presumably, that includes being prohibited from publicly describing any vaccine reactions that occur after vaccination.

WHO Supports China’s Emergency Use of Experimental COVID-19 Vaccines

According to Zheng, China gained the “understanding and support” from the World Health Organization (WHO) before starting a controversial emergency use program for its COVID-19 vaccine candidates.9

Dr. Mariângela Simão, the WHO’s assistant director-general for access to medicines and health products said…

Countries have autonomy according to their national regulations and legislations to issue emergency use authorizations for any health product, and China and other countries have already done so for different products. And WHO has emergency use listing provisions and has issued already several products for diagnostics.10

"NVIC Will Host Fifth International Public Conference on Vaccination Oct. 16-18, 2020 Online","(photo: NVIC Co-Founders Barbara Loe Fisher and Kathi Williams)

Exploring the theme “Protecting Health and Autonomy in the 21st Century,” the non-profit National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) will sponsor the Fifth International Public Conference on Vaccination Oct. 16-18, 2020 online. The conference, which is being professionally produced, will provide an educational forum for information and perspective presented by more than 40 selected speakers from the U.S. and other countries. They will discuss a range of topics being widely discussed and debated today, from infectious diseases like COVID-19 to vaccine science, policy, law and ethics and how suppression of independent scientific inquiry and censorship of rational criticism threatens health and human rights.

According to conference coordinator NVIC co-founder and president Barbara Loe Fisher, “This conference will celebrate freedom of thought, speech, conscience and the human right to autonomy and informed consent to medical risk taking.”

Scientific Inquiry, Rational Thinking, Freedom of Speech

Over three days and evenings, presenters offering their knowledge and personal experiences will include physicians and scientists publishing in the peer reviewed medical literature, nurses, holistic health care professionals, bioethicists, representatives of faith-based communities, attorneys, authors, journalists, state legislators, environmental and civil and human rights activists, and parents of vaccine injured children.

The titles of presentations will be posted on the conference website but speaker names will not be added to the website until several weeks before the conference. A sampling of topics presented at the Fifth International Public Conference on Vaccination include:

Knowledge is Power

Take Back Control of Your Health

Staying Connected, Sharing Knowledge & Experiences

The four previous international public conferences sponsored by NVIC in 1997, 2000, 2002 and 2009 were held in a hotel in the Washington DC area, and this one was originally scheduled in a hotel as well. Due to ongoing social distancing regulations and travel restrictions, for the first time NVIC​’s October 2020 conference will be held online so more people in the U.S. and around the world can participate.

“The unprecedented response by governments to the World Health Organization declaration of a coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 and the institution of physical social distancing and travel restrictions in most countries has made it very hard for people to stay physically connected,” said Loe Fisher. “The public narratives around infectious disease control measures and fast tracking of experimental vaccines makes it even more important to share our thoughts, common experiences and perspectives so we can stand strong as a national and international community of concerned citizens.“

Conference Registration Open

2020 marks the 38th year of the founding of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) by families with vaccine injured children. Dedicated to preventing vaccine injuries and deaths through public education, NVIC is the oldest and largest consumer-led non-profit organization in the U.S. publishing information on vaccines and infectious diseases and representing families whose lives have been affected by vaccine reactions, injuries and deaths.

The first 1,000 people who register for the Fifth International Public Conference on Vaccination may obtain tickets at a special price of $60 to view and secure lifetime access to presentations. There are also Starfish Sponsor opportunities for those who want to make a special donation in support of the conference, which will help NVIC keep the ticket price low.

“There are many families struggling financially right now because mothers and fathers have lost their jobs due to social distancing restrictions,” said Loe Fisher. “Families with special needs children have been especially hit hard and NVIC is committed to making this conference accessible to as many people as possible, especially those whose loved ones have suffered serious vaccine reactions and are chronically ill and disabled.”",2020-08-02 20:25:33+00:00,,0
Public Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine Faces Many Hurdles,"Story Highlights Even before a vaccine against COVID-19 has been introduced to the public in the U.S., expectations for it are low.

Dr. Anthony Fauci warns that a COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be either long-lasting or more than 50 to 60 percent effective.

Citing experience with other vaccines, a COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to provide much, if any, benefit for obese patients, defined as those with a greater than 30 percent body mass index (BMI), which includes approximately 42 percent of adults in the U.S.

Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 has said chances are slim that early vaccines against COVID-19 will be “highly effective,” defined as having a 98 percent effectiveness rating.1 Instead, Fauci predicts that an effectiveness of 60 percent or less is about the best that might be expected, adding that a vaccine with even 50 percent effectiveness would probably be considered acceptable and given the “green light” by the FDA.2

Fauci has also said that, if COVID-19 acts like other coronaviruses, vaccination may not provide durable protection. In a live stream videoconference, he said: “You can assume, that you’re going to get protection at least to take us through this cycle. When you look at natural infection it’s anywhere from six months to a year. However, with this spike protein that’s being presented in the way that we do it, with primes and in some cases boosts, we’re going to assume that there’s a degree of protection, but we have to assume that it’s going to be finite.”3

Low Expectations for Early COVID-19 Vaccines

Adults and people with co-existing chronic conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease, as well as those who are obese or live with chronic stress, are recognized as being at higher risk for complications from SARS-Cov-2 infections. Many of these same chronic poor health conditions also are predictive of adverse responses to vaccines in general. Older age, for example, is known to be associated with a less robust immune response to both vaccination and natural infection.4 Gender, genetics, blood type and underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus, all of which have been associated with more severe COVID-19 infection outcomes, have been found to influence individual immune responses to certain vaccines, although significant variations are reported.5

COVID-19 vaccines are not expected to provide much, if any, benefit for the more than 107 million people in the U.S. classified as obese.6 It has previously been recognized that vaccines are not as effective in obese people compared to the general public.7 According to Raz Shaikh, associate professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, there is no reason to think a COVID-19 vaccine will be any different. He said: “Will we have a COVID vaccine next year tailored to the obese? No way… Will it still work in the obese? Our prediction is no.”8

The Role of Obesity in Vaccine Responses

Early warnings about the increased COVID-19 infection risks faced by the obese in the pandemic came from China, where it was reported that patients with a higher body mass index (BMI) were significantly more likely to become critically ill or die from their illness compared with the general patient population.9 The first reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that patients considered “morbidly obese,” defined as those with a BMI of 40 or more, or 100 pounds over recommended weight, were at highest risk for developing severe coronavirus symptoms.

About nine percent of the U.S. population falls into the morbidly obese category. As the picture of which patients were most severely affected by COVID-19 became clearer, however, the warning has been expanded to include those at a BMI of 30 and above, or 42.4 percent of adults in the U.S.

Researchers are not sure why obesity seems to have such an impact on immune response and response to vaccination but mechanisms involving chronic inflammation may be responsible. Inflammation is a normal response to infection (or vaccination). After the immune system’s inflammatory response to the perceived threat posed by infection or vaccination is mounted, normally the inflammation ceases and health returns. However, in obese people and those with related risk factors, such as high blood pressure or elevated blood sugar levels, the inflammatory response does not “turn off” and progresses to a state of chronic mild inflammation.10

Others have suggested that the standard 1” needle may not be adequate to reach muscle tissue. It has been speculated that those with a higher BMI may require larger doses of vaccine product.11

Hepatitis B and Influenza Vaccines and Obesity

Early evidence of the effect of obesity on response to vaccination was reported in a 1985 study of hundreds of hospital workers vaccinated against hepatitis B. In that study, the hepatitis B vaccine was half as likely to protect against hepatitis B in those with a higher BMI compared to their co-workers with lower BMIs. Even when the trial was repeated with longer needles to ensure the vaccine was injected into muscle tissue rather than adipose tissue (fat), the results were the same.

A 2017 study showing that even though obese patients vaccinated against influenza did produce “a protective level of antibodies to the influenza vaccine,” they were still twice as likely as non-obese adults of a healthy weight to develop influenza or flu-like illness, at 9.8 and 5.1 percent, respectively. Those authors concluded that, “the current standard for correlates of protection, suggesting use of antibody titers to determine vaccine effectiveness in an obese population may provide misleading information.”12

Obese patients have commonly been excluded from clinical trials on experimental drugs and vaccines due to concerns that co-morbidities frequently associated with obesity might cloud results. COVID-19 safety and efficacy trials currently underway do not exclude people with obesity. Although obesity is not being viewed as a specific potential complication at this point, BMI for study participants will be reported and evaluated.13

Rapid COVID-19 Vaccine Approval Sparks Concerns

With a stated goal of delivering “300 million doses of a safe, effective vaccine for COVID-19 by January 2021, as part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics (collectively known as countermeasures),” operation “Warp Speed” has already streamlined procedures ordinarily in place to test the safety and efficacy of vaccines over the course of years.14 The Warp Speed plan states that no corners will be cut that would compromise the safety of the proposed vaccines, even though clinical trial steps are being taken simultaneously rather than consecutively as is done in non-emergency circumstances.

For example, the most promising vaccine candidates are being manufactured “at industrial scale” even before the studies are completed to establish vaccine efficacy and safety as happens normally. Theoretically, this strategy supposedly increases financial risk for companies but does not increase product risks.

Francis Collins, MD of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has said:

I think this is an effort to try to achieve efficiencies, but not to sacrifice rigor… Definitely the worst thing that could happen is if we rush through a vaccine that turns out to have significant side effects [The NIH] is creating a master plan for testing the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates in tens of thousands of people, to prove whether they really work and if they’re safe.

Addressing Russia’s newly approved vaccine, “Sputnik V,” scientists and public health professionals have expressed concern that the Russian vaccine still needs critical safety and efficacy studies, and they worry that the hasty introduction of that vaccine could put pressure on the U.S. to prematurely approve a COVID-19 vaccine of its own.15

Only about half of Americans plan to get the COVID-19 vaccine if it becomes available, with 7 in 10 of those who plan to refuse citing concerns about safety issues surrounding the rushed approval process to fast track a vaccine to licensure.16

Children Recruited in U.K. for COVID-19 Vaccine Trial,"The University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group in the United Kingdom has announced that its researchers have begun recruiting children aged five to 12 years for phase II and phase III clinical trials testing an experimental COVID-19 vaccine the university is developing in partnership with AstraZeneca plc.1

Oxford’s ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (“chimpanzee adenovirus Oxford 1” novel coronavirus-19) recombinant vaccine is made from a genetically modified adenovirus that infects chimpanzees used as a viral vector into which the COVID-19 genome is inserted so the cells of the human body express the new coronavirus’s Spike Protein (S) and induce antibodies that are supposed to prevent infection.2 Some researchers have noted that, “Viral vector-based vaccines require assessment of efficacy and safety, including immunogenicity, genetic stability, ability to evade pre-existing immunity, replication deficiency or attenuation, and genotoxicity.”3 Others have emphasized that the selection of an appropriate viral vector for a new vaccine depends upon “a thorough knowledge of the infectious agent for which the viral-vectored vaccine is being developed.”4

There are gaps in scientific knowledge about the origin of the new coronavirus and the biological mechanisms involved in the way it infects and causes disease in humans but, like most COVID-19 vaccines being fast tracked to licensure, the vaccine being created by Oxford/AstraZeneca is compressing clinical trials testing into months rather than years.

Phase I, II, III Clinical Trials Of Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Held Simultaneously

The phase I trial began in April when over 1,000 healthy adult volunteers received their experimental “ChAdOx1 nCoV-19” vaccine. Phase II expanded the age range to include those aged five to 12 years, 56 to 69 years, and those over age 70 to assess the immune response to the vaccine in people of different ages and find out if the immune system responses of older people and children are different. The phase III part of the study assesses how the vaccine works in a larger number of people over age 18 in terms of preventing infection and symptoms of COVID-19.

In the U.K., recruitment of children to participate in vaccine trials is usually done through doctors’ offices and by health care workers. The experimental vaccine being tested in clinical trials is often given at home and parents are asked to take regular temperature readings and a diary of their child’s reaction, with follow-up visits and blood tests.5 There is no financial incentive to join the vaccine trial, and parents can withdraw their child at any point. The clinical trial team also gives the child participant other routine vaccinations during home visits for the length of the study.6

Vaccine Trials Don’t Pick Up All Side Effects

Personal benefit and contributing to “the greater good” are the two most common reasons parents cite for enrolling their children in vaccine trials, according to Shamez Ladhani, MRCPCH, PhD, a pediatric infectious disease consultant at St. George’s Hospital in London, and consultant epidemiologist for Public Health England. He commented that, while there are risks, vaccine adverse reactions are rare—so much so that they often don’t get noticed until the vaccine goes on sale and is given to many more patients.

Dr. Ladhani, who is frequently involved in vaccine trials, said:

Some side effects you actually don’t find out until you have given 100,000 doses—that’s always a worry—but there isn’t a clinical trial that’s big enough that can pick that up.7

Children appear to be less affected by COVID-19, although their role in transmission of the virus remains unclear. In the U.S., 1.7 percent of COVID-19 cases for which age was known occurred in children younger than 18 years, even though they make up 22 percent of the U.S. population.8 Additionally, relatively few children with COVID-19 are hospitalized, and fewer children than adults experience fever, cough, or shortness of breath.

Children May or May Not Be Last to Get COVID-19 Vaccine

As scientists race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, some are acknowledging that children could be among the last to be vaccinated.9 The process for testing a COVID-19 vaccine in children could take “extra months and maybe years longer,” according to Paul Duprex, PhD, Director of the Center for Vaccine Research and professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at the University of Pittsburgh.

However, Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, commented that it’s possible that studies in children might “catch up” to those in adults, if they are done correctly. “There is no reason not to believe that [a vaccine] wouldn’t be available simultaneously for adults and children,” Dr. Fauci said.10

Duke University Professor Sallie Permar, MD, believes children are “key” to ending the COVID-19 pandemic and testing vaccines in children must be a priority because, “If we prioritize children now in the steps we take to end this pandemic, we will protect them while protecting all members of our community.” In USA Today, she recently advocated for experimental coronavirus vaccines to be tested in children once safety testing in adults is completed:11

Early trials of coronavirus vaccine safety and immune responses have excluded children. Once safety testing is completed in adult volunteers, however, leading candidate vaccines should be tested for safety and effectiveness in children. And once safety and efficacy are established, children should be among the first to receive the vaccine.

Throughout history, scientists have consistently found that infants and children are not simply small adults. Children’s bodies and maturing immune systems function differently from adults,12 which is why pharmaceutical products are often studied separately in children and adults. Already, scientists are pointing out differences in immune system responses by children to COVID-19 infections compared to responses by adults, who are at increased risk for complications.13

Oxford’s COVID-19 Animal Trials Failed But Manufacturing Ramps Up

The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca researchers are proceeding with testing the experimental ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine in children, even though a May 13, 2020 published report indicated that small trials of the vaccine in mice and monkeys were not successful in proving effectiveness against infection. Although the animal trials provided evidence that the experimental vaccine induced a “robust humoral and cell mediated response” in mice and appeared to protect against development of viral pneumonia in monkeys, it did not prevent infection with COVID-19.14 15

On June 5, 2020, Market Watch reported that AstraZeneca has begun manufacturing two billion doses of Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine before clinical trials have been completed and results analyzed and published, reportedly in August. AstraZeneca has received more than $1B in funding from the U.S. government to accelerate development of its vaccine and deliver 300 million doses to the U.S., which will include a Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. this summer involving 30,000 volunteer participants.16

According to Market Watch:

AstraZeneca has struck a $750 million agreement with two health organizations backed by [Bill] Gates and his wife Melinda—the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the vaccine alliance—to provide and distribute 300 million doses fairly across the world. AstraZeneca has also agreed to supply the Serum Institute of India with 1 billion doses for low and middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million before the end of 2020.17

The company has indicated that as many as 30 million doses could be available in Britain as early as September 2020 and the U.S. could begin receiving supplies of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine as early as October.18

"COVID-19 Vaccine Will Likely Be Given Multiple Times, Perhaps Annually","In an interview with the JAMA on June 2, 2020, Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said that while he was “cautiously optimistic” about the effectiveness of the vaccines being developed for COVID-19, he was concerned that any protection the vaccines may provide might only be temporary. “If you look at the duration of protection when you recover from one of the several benign coronaviruses that cause the common cold, the durability of infection is only measured in a year or less as opposed to the other infections where you can get 15 to 20 years of protection,” Dr. Fauci said.1 2 3

Fauci and others developing or promoting COVID-19 vaccination are talking about the likelihood that the new coronavirus vaccine will have to be administered in multiple doses, perhaps even annually like the influenza vaccine.

There are more than 100 research programs around the world working on candidate vaccines for COVID-19, including 10 that have reached the clinical evaluation stage, either phase 1 or phase 2. Among these are programs led by Western pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca plc (in partnership with the University of Oxford); BioNTech SE partnered with Pfizer, Inc.; Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Moderna, Inc. (in partnership with NIAID) and Novavax, Inc. Another 123 programs to develop a COVID-19 vaccine remain in preclinical evaluation.4

Doubts About Coronavirus Vaccine Long Term Effectiveness

According to Dr. Fauci, “It is still not clear which vaccine will be effective.” He believes that the phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving thousands of people will provide the data needed to better evaluate the potential effectiveness of the candidate vaccines. The messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine being fast tracked to licensure by Moderna, Inc., which is funded not only by NIAID but also by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) and half a billion dollars from the federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA),5 as well as the AstraZeneca/Oxford coronavirus vaccine development programs are scheduled to proceed to phase 3 trials later this summer.

“The real business end of this all will be the phase 3 that starts in the first week of July, hopefully. We want to get as many data points as we can,” Dr. Fauci said. “I’m cautiously optimistic that with the multiple candidates we have with different platforms, that we’re going to have a vaccine that shows a degree of efficacy that will make it deployable.”1 6 Dr. Fauci’s said he is less worried about whether someone would get a “protective response” from a COVID-19 vaccine than he is about the “durability” of that response.

Vaccinologist Greg Poland, MD of the Mayo Clinic noted that immunity for seasonal coronaviruses may last several years or as little as 80 days. “There’s an immunologic secret locked up in the long class of coronaviruses that we don’t yet understand,” Dr. Poland said.1 2 3 6

COVID-19 Vaccine Likely Given Several Times or Annually

Vaccinologists like Fauci and Poland, who are expressing uncertainty about the length of protection a COVID-19 vaccine would provide, have reinforced speculation that two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will be required over the course of about a month and that a booster shot may also be needed a few years later. In a recent article for USA Today, Elizabeth Weise wrote, “The first shot would prime the immune system, helping it recognize the virus. The second shot would strengthen the immune response.”7

Immunologist Barry Bloom, PhD of Harvard University’s T.H Chan School of Public Health said:

As far as I am aware, with one set of exceptions, all the front-line vaccine developers are contemplating two shots. The one exception is Merck, which last week pushed forward on two vaccines, each of which they hoped would be one-shot vaccines.7

Scott Gottlieb, MD, who joined the board of directors of Pfizer after resigning as Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2019, recently told CNBC that a vaccine for COVID-19 (like the one Pfizer is developing) may have to be an annual shot. Gottlieb said:

This is probably going to be a seasonal vaccine, the coronavirus vaccine. It’s probably a vaccine that we’re going to need to take every year, and Dr. Fauci is right… the immunity is not going to be long-term in the form of like a smallpox vaccine or a polio vaccine where you get the vaccine once and you’re protected for life or most of your life, or a measles vaccine. You’re going to need to take this shot regularly and maybe annually and the immunity might last up to a year.8 9

Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech recently began clinical trials in the United States testing one and two doses of their experimental BNT162 vaccine for COVID-19 on human subjects.10

Health Officials Launch Mobile App to Pre-Register Chicagoans for...,"Story Highlights

The Chicago Department of Public Health has launched a website and a mobile device application encouraging residents to pre-register to get for a future COVID-19 vaccine.

Chicago’s Mayor said the electronic database will be used to prepare plans for mass vaccination of all residents after a COVID-19 vaccine is licensed by the FDA for use in the U.S.

The registration data obtained through the new mobile app is also expected to be used by public health officials for tracing contacts of those suspected of being infected with COVID-19.

The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) has developed a website and an application known as the “Chi COVID Coach “ app where Chicagoans can now pre-register to receive a COVID-19 vaccine once it is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the U.S.1

According to the Chicago Sun Times, the “Chi COVID Coach” mobile app was developed by Google and MTX in collaboration with the CDPH to help communicate with Chicagoans who have either tested positive for the coronavirus or may be experiencing symptoms.1 The application uses Google Cloud’s technology to provide residents with real-time information.

Pre-Registration for Future Mass Vaccination in Chicago

The CDPH website states that the main purpose of the “Chi COVID Coach” app is to coach COVID-19 patients on symptoms, provide testing information, announce the availability of future antibody testing information and allow pre-registration for when a vaccine becomes available.2

The website states, “Looking even further ahead, registering with Chi COVID Coach will ensure CDPH has your individual information as we plan for Chicago’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign–which likely will not happen until 2021, once a vaccine is available.”

CDPH Commissioner Allison Arwady said officials are building their plans with the intention to vaccinate the whole city of Chicago.3 According to a press release from Mayor Lori Elaine Lightfoot’s office, “Though a vaccine may be many months away, CDPH is already taking steps to prepare for mass vaccination. Because of this, everyone is encouraged to sign up, whether they have symptoms or not.”4

Although Mayor Lightfoot and CDPH Commissioner Arwady said a COVID-19 vaccine is not expected until 2021, both said they are already mapping plans to vaccinate the whole city by purchasing syringes and equipment and choosing locations where the vaccine will be administered.1

Using Technology For “Contact Tracing” and Mapping Plans

Even though a COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be licensed for emergency use until the end of this year with widespread use not expected until 2021, the goal of pre-registering Chicagoans and collecting personal medical information in an electronic database will make the data immediately available to public health officials once a licensed vaccine is distributed in the United States.5

Public health officials in Chicago are weighing technology options needed to link a person’s symptoms to COVID-19 test results, vaccination status and ultimately, contact tracing.5

Contact tracing involves electronically monitoring the movements of people, usually through smartphones carried by the majority of people, and tracing everyone that a person, who tests positive for the coronavirus, has been in contact with. Public health officials have said that this practice is viewed as a crucial step to safely re-open the Chicago economy.5

Mayor Lightfoot said that the city of Chicago is looking at adopting a mobile app technology being developed in Germany.1 She states, “The German government is working on an app that will automatically be able to do and facilitate contact tracing on the basis of proximity to somebody who is subsequently tested positive. The app will collect information about who you’ve been in contact with, then automatically send out an alert.”1

Chicago officials maintain that the electronic surveillance data is protected and will only be used by CDPH for public health purposes related to controlling the spread of COVID-19.5

GSK and Sanofi COVID-19 Vaccine Produced in Insect Cells with...,"Story Highlights

GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur are partnering to develop an experimental COVID-19 vaccine.

The two global vaccine manufacturers are using existing recombinant DNA vaccine technology and a squalene adjuvant for their COVID-19 vaccine.

Clinical trials are scheduled to begin in the second half of 2020 and, if successful, the vaccine will be available in 2021.

On Apr. 14, 2020, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) of the United Kingdom and Sanofi Pasteur of France announced they have signed a letter of intent to collaborate on development of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine using existing technology patented by both companies.1 According to GSK’s chief executive Emma Walmsley, “This collaboration brings two of the world’s largest vaccines companies together. By combining our science and our technologies, we believe we can help accelerate the global effort to develop a vaccine to protect as many people as possible from COVID-19.”1

GSK and Sanofi are developing the COVID-19 vaccine in collaboration with and $30M in funding from the U.S. government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)2 under the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The experimental coronoavirus vaccine will combine GSK’s proprietary squalene-based vaccine adjuvant AS03 used in the company’s H1N1 influenza vaccine Pandemrix, with the insect cell-based recombinant DNA vaccine technology that Sanofi Pasteur currently uses to make their inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine, FluBlok.

GSK is the largest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue and Sanofi is the third largest. According to Scrip Informa Pharma Intelligence, the business partnership between the two experienced vaccine manufacturers utilizing already licensed technology to create a COVID-19 vaccine could place them in front of companies seeking approval for experimental mRNA and DNA technology not yet licensed:3

It has taken longer to emerge than the many fast-tracked programs launched in recent months, but GlaxoSmithKline PLC’s decision to work with Sanofi could prove to be a significant boost to the chances of a broadly effective COVID-19 vaccine emerging in 2021. There are around 70 vaccines against COVID-19 currently in development around the world—including candidates based on novel technologies from Moderna, Inovio and Cansino Biologics already in Phase I trials. But two of these frontrunners have never brought a vaccine to market before, and the third has only limited experience—which makes their chances of success much slimmer.

GSK’s Squalene-Based AS03 Adjuvant

Adjuvants are added to vaccines to enhance the pro-inflammatory immune response induced by vaccination.4 Aluminum salts were added to the diphtheria-tetanus toxoid vaccines in the 1920’s and remained as an ingredient when whole cell pertussis vaccine was added to create the combination DPT vaccine in the 1940s, and also when the acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) vaccine was licensed for infants in 1996. Aluminum-based adjuvants are included in hepatitis, HPV, pneumococcal, meningococcal and other inactivated vaccines routinely administered to children and adults, as well as in anthrax vaccine given to US military personnel.5 Evidence that aluminum is neurotoxic to humans has been steadily accumulating in the medical literature.6 7

An oil-based vaccine adjuvant was introduced in the U.S. in 2007, when GSK’s HPV vaccine, Cervarix, was licensed and contained monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) combined with aluminum hydroxide (Cervarix is no longer available in the U.S.).8 In 2012, the FDA licensed an H5N1 influenza vaccine containing GSK’s oil-based AS03 adjuvant and the vaccine was added to the national stockpile for emergency use if there is an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu.9 In 2015, the FDA licensed an influenza vaccine (Fluad) manufactured by Sequiris for seniors over age 65 years that contains an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene oil (MF59) as an adjuvant.10 11

AS03 is GSK’s proprietary adjuvant system containing a-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion.12 AS03 ramps up the pro-inflammatory immune response in the body to try to generate cellular immunity and more vaccine strain antibodies. Adding AS03 to a vaccine also makes it easier for a company to manufacture a vaccine in large quantities.13

If the FDA licenses a COVID-19 vaccine containing ASO3, it would be the first time a vaccine recommended for all children and adults in the U.S. would contain an oil-based adjuvant.

GSK’s 2009/2010 H1N1 influenza vaccine, Pandemrix, contained the company’s AS03 adjuvant. Pandemrix was never licensed in the U.S. but, after it was used in 2009-2010 in Europe, there were reports that a number of children in Norway, Finland, the UK and other countries developed narcolepsy, an autoimmune disorder.14 By 2013, studies conducted in Europe had confirmed an association between the AS03-adjuvanted Pandemrix vaccine and narcolepsy.15 16 In response, GSK scientists published a study in 2019 defending the safety of AS03.17

There are continuing reports in the medical literature that children and adults with certain genotypes are more susceptible to developing autoimmune disorders after receiving adjuvanted vaccines, raising questions about increased risks for individuals unable to resolve strong pro-inflammatory responses stimulated by oil-based adjuvants like AS03.18 19

GSK Aware of AS03 Adjuvant Knowledge Gaps

In 2018, scientists working for GSK commented in an article for Seminars in Immunology that there are significant knowledge gaps about the molecular mechanisms for how vaccine adjuvants affect immune function:20

Oil in water emulsions are stronger adjuvant as compared to aluminum salts and have different mechanisms of action. Nevertheless, they have two things in common: (1) their mode of action is not via TLR binding; (ii) their development, as for alum, was empirical and based on rather old technology used to formulate compounds, without a solid understanding of the mechanisms underlying their immunostimulatory properties. Thus, for aluminum salts, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the adjuvanticity of emulsions remains unknown.

The GSK scientists acknowledged that oil adjuvanted vaccines increase the inflammatory response to increase immunogenicity, while also increasing reactogenicity, and the biological mechanisms for adverse reactions and the genetic risk factors involved are not understood:

Common to all adjuvanted vaccines, an increase in short-lived local and systemic symptoms (often referred to as reactogenicity) is observed after vaccination when emulsions are used. The mechanisms of reactogenicity have not been studied in detail and not surprisingly, there are no established biomarkers of reactogenicity of vaccines in general, including adjuvanted vaccines. A study in adults in the UK vaccinated with AS03-adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic vaccines reported a higher expression of a small set of genes in those individuals who had reported adverse events of medium/high intensity, although it is not clear whether these genes directly related to clinical symptoms… It needs, then, to be determined whether these signatures are specific to one particular adjuvant, for a family of adjuvants, or could represent a common signature of a propensity to reactogenicity which becomes more apparent in individuals with specific pre-vaccination phenotypes or with defined, still unspecified genetic signatures.

COVID-19 Vaccine Uses Army Worm Cells and Baculovirus Expression Vector Platform

Sanofi Pasteur will contribute its S-protein COVID-19 antigen, which is based on recombinant DNA technology, for the experimental coronovirus vaccine. According to the joint press release issued by GSK and Sanofi on Apr. 14, “This technology has produced an exact genetic match to proteins found on the surface of the virus, and the DNA sequence encoding this antigen has been combined into the DNA of the baculovirus expression platform, the basis of Sanofi’s licensed recombinant influenza product in the US.”1

Sanofi’s recombinant FluBlok influenza vaccine was originally developed by Protein Sciences, a Connecticut biotechnology company that Sanofi purchased in 2017.21 In 2013, the FDA licensed trivalent FluBlok influenza vaccine and, in 2017, quadrivalent FluBlok was licensed.22

In 2012, a year before the FDA gave Protein Sciences a license to market FluBlok in the U.S., a scientist working for Protein Sciences explained the “plug and play” benefits of using the Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS) for vaccine production:23

The potential of the BEVS platform is enormous as its transient nature makes it an attractive “plug and play” protein production system—a single well characterized cell line is used for the production of all proteins, thereby eliminating the time-consuming process of preparing, qualifying and securing regulatory approval of a new cell line for each new protein. By developing a universal protein purification process, one can begin to imagine that a single multi-product production facility could be established to produce a multitude of vaccines to combat a broad range of diseases.

Sanofi’s FluBlok contains hemagglutinen (HA) genes from influenza viruses produced in ovarian cells from the Fall Army Worm (Spodopter frugperda) using a baculovirus expression system.24 25 Canadian bioengineers described the 45-day process it takes to produce FluBlok vaccine:26

FluBlok production involves an initial cloning process of the HA gene into the baculovirus expression vector. The recombinant baculovirus generated is then used to infect insect cells in large-scale bioreactors. The infected cells are harvested using centrifugation, and the antigen is extracted from the cells using Triton X-100 and then clarified using depth filtration.

According to the National Institutes of Health, the recombinant DNA technology that Sanofi uses to produce their FluBlok influenza vaccine (and will be used to produce the GSk/Sanofi COVID-19 vaccine) will likely eventually replace traditional vaccine production methods:27

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and its industry partners have made progress in moving from both the egg-based and cell-based flu vaccine production methods toward recombinant DNA manufacturing for flu vaccines. This method does not require an egg-grown vaccine virus and does not use chicken eggs at all in the production process. Instead, manufacturers isolate a certain protein from a naturally occurring (“wild type”) recommended flu vaccine virus. These proteins are then combined with portions of another virus that grows well in insect cells. The resulting “recombinant” vaccine virus is then mixed with insect cells and allowed to replicate. The flu surface protein called hemagglutinin is then harvested from these cells and purified.

GSK’s virus-like-particle HPV vaccine, Cervarix also uses BEVS for production. In 2015, virologists in the Netherlands observed that expiration of the original patent on BEVS is facilitating “commercial application of this expression system by many more companies.”28

Mammalian Cells Able to Internalize Baculovirus

A baculovirus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that can infect many different types of insects. The baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is the one most widely used by virologists and biotechnology companies to produce recombinant proteins.

News-Medical describes how “mammalian cells are able to internalize baculovirus” and how the Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS) and can be used to express and deliver genes:29

The insect cell-based BEVS has been extensively used to produce many diverse types of recombinant proteins for research, medical, agricultural, and veterinary purposes. Recombinant AcMNPV-infected insect cells produce a huge amount of recombinant proteins. The baculovirus polyhedrin or p10 is normally highly expressed during the late stages of infection and is not essential for the pathogenesis and replication within a host insect cell. The baculovirus polyhedrin or p10 can be replaced with a gene of interest, which allows for the promoters to express the gene in abundance allowing for a very high concentration of the gene of interest to be made. AcMNPV is a virus that can only infect insects. Past studies discovered that mammalian cells were able to internalize baculovirus. Other studies subsequently discovered that recombinant AcMNPV can infect mammalian cells. Recombinant baculovirus can be combined with several different proteins in order to target different cell types.

When Protein Sciences first approached the FDA with evidence for fast tracking licensure of FluBlok, the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) provided a public comment at a November 2009 meeting of the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) questioning whether high protein content and using insect calls and insect viruses for vaccine production could compromise safety:30

FluBlok contains three times as much protein as other influenza vaccines. There is always the potential for increased cross-reactive autoimmune responses in individuals who are genetically predisposed to autoimmunity and immune mediated neurological dysfunction. I am thinking of the Bell’s Palsy case in these trials that may or may not have been triggered or exacerbated by FluBlok vaccination. The relatively small numbers of individuals in these clinical trials may not reveal the rarer but very serious complications involving demyelination of the brain and autoimmune disorders that have been reported following receipt of recombinant protein vaccines such as hepatitis B and HPV vaccines, including GBS, CNS vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and multiple sclerosis. In the current effort to fast track the use of a new technology which clones hemagglutinin genes from three influenza viruses—which may be of human as well as mammal and bird origin—and splice them into baculoviruses, which are then used to infect caterpillar cells to produce the hemagglutinin contained in the new recombinant protein based influenza vaccine, there is always the possibility that adventitious agents contaminating insect cells could end up in the vaccines. A 2005 World Health Organization document on regulation of candidate human vaccines states that “Most insect cells may have viruses in them and infection can be hard to detect and difficult to eliminate…steps should be taken to eliminate them.” The inadvertent contamination of polio vaccines with SV40 serves as a cautionary tale and the public will clearly want reassurance that sufficient adventitious agent contamination screening is in place with this vaccine using an insect virus and insect cells for production, guaranteeing that no future unusual adverse effects will be seen as more people receive the vaccine.

In 2015, a Protein Science official stated in Biotechnology Journal that the insect-based BEVS platform to produce vaccines must be carefully monitored for adventitious agent contamination:31

Adventitious agents have been detected in some insect cell lines. For instance, the Trichoplusia ni High Five cell line, BTI‐TN‐5B1‐4, used to make Cervarix®, was found to be latently infected with an Alphanodavirus that was induced by recombinant baculovirus infection. In addition, other insect cell lines, such as those generated from Drosophila melanogaster, have been shown to harbor innate retroelements derived from retroviruses that could potentially be infectious. More recently, a possible insect‐specific virus Sf‐rhabdovirus was identified in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Although studies showed that this virus could not enter or replicate in human cell lines and, therefore, is unlikely to be a risk, novel cell lines will most likely need to be characterized and monitored for the presence of this virus as they are for nodaviruses, retroviruses and others. In general, because adventitious agents are a potential threat, cell substrates of all origins (including insect and others) must be thoroughly tested for the presence and infectivity of such agents before they are allowed by regulatory agencies for manufacturing use.

Goal to Manufacture 600 Million Doses By 2021

Sanofi and GSK with their combined manufacturing capacity are hoping to produce up to 600 million doses of their new coronavirus vaccine by 2021.32 Clinical trials are scheduled to begin in the second half of 2020 and, if trial results are positive, the companies plan to make the vaccine available to the public by the second half of 2021.4

Sanofi and GSK maintain they have an advantage in the race to be the first to put a licensed COVID-19 on the market, not only because they are using already-licensed technologies, but because of their ability to produce more doses of the vaccine quickly in the COVID-19 pandemic situation.33 GSK’s chief executive Emma Walmsley stated, “The advantages are we both have scale in manufacturing. These are both proven pandemic technologies whether their antigen [the protein that forms the basis of Sanofi’s vaccine] or our adjuvant.”34

Multiplying COVID-19 Vaccine Business Partnerships

Prior to this collaboration between GSK and Sanofi Pasteur, Sanofi was already in a COVID-19 vaccine partnership with Translate Bio, a clinical-stage messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics company in Massachusetts that is focusing on developing mRNA vaccines.35

GSK is also involved in providing its ASO3 squalene adjuvant for other companies and universities developing COVID-19 vaccines: Australia’s University of Queenland; California’s Dynavax Technologies Corp; Innovax, a subsidiary of China’s YangShengTang Group; China’s Xiamen University, and China’s Clover Biopharmaceuticals Inc.36

Oxford Begins COVID-19 Vaccine Trials to Meet September Deadline,"On Mar. 17, 2020, European Commission (EC) president Ursula von der Leyen said she was hopeful a vaccine for COVID-19 could be available this September. Her view was based on conversations she had had with managers of German biotechnology firm CureVac AG which has developed an experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine that it plans to test in human trials this summer. According to von der Leyen, “The European Union provided them (CureVac) up to €80 million ($89.4 million), and I hope that, with this support, we can have a vaccine on the market perhaps before autumn.1 2 3

The remarks by the EC president came as a surprise, given that well-known public health figures, including Anthony Fauci, MD of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Tedros Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), estimated that it would take 12-18 months to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, which means the earliest timeframe a vaccine could be ready is sometime in early 2021.1 2

Another group of vaccine developers at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom are racing to get a vaccine ready to go by the end of this summer. On Apr. 23, 2020, the Oxford team began human trials on an experimental vaccine, designated ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.5

The trial is being led by Andrew Pollard, PhD, professor of pediatric infection and immunity at the University of Oxford. It will involve more than 800 volunteers, including Elisa Granato who was the first to being injected with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Half of the volunteers will get the vaccine, while the other half will serve as the control group and receive a meningitis vaccine. A second trial, consisting of approximately 5,000 volunteers, is scheduled to begin this summer.6

The vaccine is made from a virus known as ChAdOx1, a weakened version of an adenovirus that causes the common cold as well as infections in chimpanzees, which has been genetically modified. According to the University of Oxford:

Genetic material has been added to the ChAdOx1 construct, that is used to make proteins from the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) called Spike glycoprotein (S). This protein is usually found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 and plays an essential role in the infection pathway of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus uses its spike protein to bind to ACE2 receptors on human cells to gain entry to the cells and cause an infection.5

The Oxford research team is led by Sarah Gilbert, PhD, who is professor of vaccinology at Oxford University and cofounder of British biotechnology firm Vaccitech Ltd. Dr. Gilbert said she is “80 percent confident” the vaccine will work and that it is possible it could be ready by September “if everything goes perfectly.”6 7 She added, “I think there’s a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine. It’s not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at.”7 8

Brendon Wren, PhD, professor of microbial pathogenesis at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, believes Dr. Gilbert’s optimism is realistic. Dr. Wren said:

The Oxford vaccine group are among the most advanced groups in the world and have been working on vaccine biopreparedness for several years. This means that they can test and evaluate COVID-19 vaccine candidates rapidly (even in human volunteers). A strong vaccine candidate available by September would not be surprising.8

Inovio COVID-19 Vaccine Uses Electricity to Drive DNA Into Body Cells,"Story Highlights Inovio Pharmaceuticals has started Phase 1 testing of its experimental COVID-19 DNA vaccine in healthy volunteers.

The U.S. biotech firm has already produced enough of the vaccine to support Phase 1 (immune system reactivity and safety) and Phase 2 (efficacy) testing and plans to have one million doses ready for distribution by the end of 2020.

The experimental vaccine requires a special device that uses electricity to drive DNA into cells of the body.

Inovio Pharmaceuticals headquartered in Pennsylvania, has just begun Phase 1 human clinical trials of its new DNA vaccine for COVID-19 (INO-4800).1 Inovio’s experimental DNA vaccine uses an electrical device to deliver DNA directly into the cells of a person being vaccinated.2

The company’s Apr. 6, 2020 announcement of Phase 1 clinical trials stated: “Preclinical data, which have been shared with global regulatory authorities and submitted as part of the IND, have shown promising immune response results across multiple animal models. Additional preclinical trials, including challenge studies, will continue in parallel with the Phase 1 clinical trial.”3

In the U.S., the development, testing and licensing process for an experimental vaccine generally takes 15-20 years to complete,4 5 but there are calls to speed up the licensing process for COVID-19 vaccines.6 Drug companies in the U.S. and other countries are racing to fast track their experimental COVID-19 vaccines to market within 12 to 18 months or even sooner.7 If companies get an “emergency use” authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),8 Inovio’s DNA vaccine could be among those vaccines ready by the fall of 2020 to be distributed to health care workers and other groups considered to be at “high risk” for COVID-19 infections or complications.

Funded by Gates, CEPI, DOD with Wistar & Other Partnerships

Inovio’s COVID-19 vaccine research has been funded by a $5M grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and a $9M grant from the Norway-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).9 Inovio also has a partnership with Philadelphia’s Wistar Institute and Beijing Advaccine Biotechnology Co. in China to develop the vaccine.10 11

In addition, Inovio has a partnership with Ology Bioservices, Inc., headquartered in Florida. Ology and Inovio secured a $11.9M contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to provide the experimental DNA coronavirus vaccine for upcoming clinical trials and potential manufacturing of the vaccine for military personnel in the future. In a Mar. 24 press release issued by Ology and Inovio, Douglas Bryce, Joint Program Executive Officer for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, said:12

Given the current global health crisis, prophylaxis/vaccine development is critical to defend against the coronavirus disease 2019. We need several approaches to ensure we have a quick solution, and the medical countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing Facility is poised to contribute to the race for a vaccine in coordination with our interagency partners like Health and Human Services, along with our partners in industry and academia.

Healthy Volunteers Get Two Doses in Trials

Acceptance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of their Investigational New Drug (IND) program allowed Inovio to move forward with enrolling 40 healthy volunteers from Philadelphia’s Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the Center for Pharmaceutical Research in Kansas City, Missouri.13 The first volunteers were injected with the experimental vaccine on April 5 and clinical trial participants each will be given two doses, four weeks apart.

The Phase 1 study is designed to evaluate immune system response and safety of Inovio’s DNA COVID-19 vaccine for use in humans. Preliminary data are expected by late summer and Inovio plans to immediately move on to Phase 2 studies to evaluate efficacy of the vaccine.

Inovio started working on its COVID-19 vaccine when the genetic sequence of the virus became available in early January 2020. The company has already produced thousands of doses of INO-4800, enough to supply both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. They plan to have one million doses of the vaccine available by the end of 2020, “for trials as well as emergency use, subject to regulatory guidance and funding.”14

In July 2019, Inovio announced positive results from a Phase 1 clinical trial testing of its experimental DNA vaccine for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS),15 a new coronavirus infection that emerged in 2012. MERS is associated with a high mortality rate of 12 to 86 percent.16

The DNA Vaccine Difference

According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), “Traditional vaccines consist of entire pathogens that have been killed or weakened so that they cannot cause disease.” 17 Other vaccines developed in the late 20th century contain only microbe components, or antigens, that are thought to best stimulate an immune response and antibody production.

Licensed viral and bacterial vaccines that are in widespread use today are categorized as either killed inactivated, live attenuated, toxoid, or subunit vaccines. They contain antigens from lab altered viruses and bacteria, as well as adjuvants, such as aluminum or oil-in-water emulsion, to provoke stronger inflammatory responses for stimulating artificial immunity; preservatives, such as Thimerosal; stabilizers, such as MSG and gelatin; and residual substances from the manufacturing process, such as chemicals, antibiotics, human diploid cells, animal and insect cell proteins and other excipients. 18

However, for the past several decades, scientists have been experimenting with creation of nucleic acid vaccines which, according to NIAID, “involves introducing genetic material encoding the antigen or antigens against which an immune response is sought. The body’s own cells then use this genetic material to produce the antigens.”19 DNA vaccines like Inovio’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine (INO-4800) inject a small piece of circular DNA called a plasmid that carries genes encoding proteins from the pathogen (in this case, COVID-19) to provoke the cells into producing antibodies.

Writing in Biotech Primer, Emily Burke, PhD explained that, “the ‘visiting’ DNA prompts the host to produce the target viral protein and consequent immune response within their own cells, but without [causing] an infection. DNA vaccines try to stimulate the body’s cells to continue to reproduce the antigen. Burke commented on the difficulty of getting the body’s cells to accept injected DNA without further intervention and stated:20

The key challenge for DNA/RNA vaccines is getting patients’ cells to accept the introduced genetic material. So far, the most effective technique seems to be electroporation–delivering short pulses of electrical current to the patient with the vaccine. The electricity creates temporary pores in a patient’s cell membranes, enabling the DNA/RNA to enter.

DNA Vaccines: Gaps in Knowledge

DNA (and RNA) vaccines have been available and approved for veterinary medicine, but none have yet been approved for human use. Compared to traditional vaccines, nucleic acid (genetic) vaccines are less inexpensive and easier to manufacture because they consist only of DNA or RNA, which is taken up and translated into protein by host cells.21

The World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges there are gaps in scientific knowledge about DNA vaccines and states:22

Many aspects of the immune response generated by DNA vaccines are not understood. However, this has not impeded significant progress towards the use of this type of vaccine in humans, and clinical trials have begun.

Some of the outstanding questions about DNA vaccine safety include:23

chronic inflammation because the vaccine continually stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies;

possible integration of plasmid DNA into the body’s host genome resulting in mutations;

problems with DNA replication;

triggering of autoimmune responses, and

activation of cancer-causing genes.

Inovio’s Electric Device Delivery System Drives DNA Into Body Cells

On Mar. 12, 2020 Inovio announced it had received a $5M grant from the Gates Foundation to accelerate the testing and scale up of CELLECTRA® 3PSP proprietary hand held “smart device” running on batteries for the intradermal delivery of its DNA COVID-19 vaccine (INO-4800). The press release explained that electricity will be used to give people Inovio’s DNA vaccine in order to “open small pores in the cell reversibly to allow the plasmids to enter” so the “cell’s own machinery” can “generate coded antigens, which then stimulate an antibody response:”24

The next generation CELLECTRA 3PSP device is designed specifically for a COVID-19 type pandemic scenario. It is a small, portable, hand-held, user-friendly device that runs on readily available “AA” batteries… INOVIO’s DNA medicines deliver optimized plasmids directly into cells intramuscularly or intradermally using INOVIO’s proprietary hand-held smart device called CELLECTRA®. CELLECTRA® uses a brief electrical pulse to open small pores in the cell reversibly to allow the plasmids to enter, overcoming a key limitation of other DNA and mRNA approaches. Once inside the cell, the plasmids are used by the cell’s own machinery to generate coded antigens, which then stimulate an immune response, thereby strengthening the body’s own natural defense mechanisms. Administration with the CELLECTRA device ensures that the DNA medicine is delivered directly into the body’s cells, where it can go to work immediately mounting an immune response.

The company added that, “INOVIO’s DNA medicines do not interfere with or change in any way an individual’s own DNA.”

Electroporation Not So Painless

Electroporation is defined as “a process of applying a high-voltage electrical pulse to a living cell, causing temporary permeability of the cell membrane, through which a foreign material such as DNA may pass.”25 Over the past two centuries, electric fields have been used to kill microbes for food and water sterilization and, since the 1990s, biomedical researchers have investigated using reversible electroporation to temporarily destabilize cell membranes for the purpose of (1) fusing cells together through membrane destabilization (electrofusion); (2) introducing DNA material into cells through transient pores in the membrane (electrogenethearpy); and (3) delivering chemotherapeutic drugs directly into cells (electrochemotherapy). Irreversible electroporation uses a much higher electrical energy regime that induces cell death and is employed in certain types of therapies to treat cancer.26 27

In 2013, researchers at Inovio and University of Pennsylvania division of Infectious Disease speculated about how electroporation and Inovio’s CELLECTRA® adaptive constant current device helps enhance vaccine DNA uptake by cells and generates a “more robust immune response:”28

Electroporation (EP) immune response enhancement may mechanistically be due to local inflammatory processes caused by the procedure itself. Electrical stimulation induces the secretion of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines and recruitment of monocytes, lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells to the site of EP…As a result of these processes, both humoral and cell-mediated immunity is augmented compared with DNA injection alone, thus potentially enhancing vaccine efficacy.

The Inovio and University of Pennsylvania researchers noted that “A primary drawback of electroporation (EP) is pain and discomfort at the application site compared with convention injections.” In a small clinical trial, they evaluated the pain “tolerability” of the CELLECTRA® device by testing it on 10 healthy male adults given a sterile saline solution injection without any DNA, which was followed by application of electroporation using the Inovio device.

Nine out of ten subjects experienced mild to moderate injection site reactions of pain, tenderness, redness and swelling. There were also reaction reports of involuntary muscle contraction and mild to severe asymptomatic increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase) levels in the blood of 6 participants.

According to Lab Tests Online, “creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme found in the heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and other tissues. Increased amounts of CK are released into the blood when there is muscle damage.”29 The researchers acknowledged that “The EP procedure has been shown to carry some potential of transient muscle damage in animal models, evident as increased numbers of fibers with central nucleoli and damaged myofibrillar bundles.”

At the end of the article, researchers discussed how EP could stimulate greater and longer lasting immune responses for experimental DNA vaccines being designed to prevent HIV and HPV. Although the 10 healthy male adults in the Inovio and University of Pennsylvania study did not get injected with DNA, the researchers explained that:30

EP must be applied immediately after DNA injection to exert its effect on gene expression…Inflammatory cell infiltration associated with the EP process may partially account for the increase in uptake. It is possible that antigen presentation is more efficient under stressful conditions in electrically stimulated cells and may create an adjuvant effect. Along these lines, EP has been shown to induce considerable lymphocytic infiltration, in addition to CPK elevation and skeletal muscle damage evident as lesions in mice. Because muscle tissue does not generally harbor many resident antigen-presenting cells, it is likely that recruitment to the injection site contributes to the efficacy of EP.

University of Pittsburgh Researchers Use Genetically Modified Measles Vaccine to Create COVID-19 Vaccine,"Vaccine developers at the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Vaccine Research (CVR) have taken a part of the coronavirus involved in COVID-19 infection and attached it to a genetically modified measles vaccine that has been used for many years.1

According to CVR Director Dr. Paul Duprex, “CVR has a mandated role to respond rapidly to global outbreaks such as COVID-19; to develop animal models of disease; to use these to test the efficacy of candidate vaccines such as recombinant measles viruses expressing a range of SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] genes.”2

CVR Will Get COVID-19 Vaccine Grant from CEPI

The University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Vaccine Research, as well as Themis Bioscience in Austria and Institute Pasteur in France, are part of an international group receiving a $4.9 million grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to develop a COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on measles-vector technology.2

Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, said that they selected CVR, Themis Bioscience and Institute Pasteur as recipients of the grant to create the COVID-19 candidate vaccine because of the science behind their proposed strategy to use measles-vector technology.2

Hatchett said:

The measles vaccine is used here as a vehicle. Using the measles vaccine (also called MV) as a vector, recombinant vaccines can be designed to express antigens from other pathogens” including MERS, HIV and yellow fever among others.2

He added:

The use of the modified MV as a vehicle for vaccination against these pathogens makes it possible to deliver the antigens directly in the compartments of the immune system capable of inducing a protective memory response.2

CVR Receives Samples of Coronavirus for Vaccine Development

University of Pittsburgh’s CVR was one of the first research labs in the United States to receive the samples of the coronavirus in February 2020 from an infected patient in the state of Washington.2 The small vial contained a half milliliter of fluid and 50 to 60 million coronavirus particles. Dr. Duprex explained it was received in a box. Inside the box was dry ice and another box. After the second box was opened, there was a special container in which the sample was placed.3

The residents of Pittsburgh were concerned about samples of COVID-19 being sent to their city; however, Dr. Duprex reassured them of the safety measure taken to safely transport the virus. He said the box was transported by air and ground using approved shippers experienced in safely transporting biological and infectious materials. He stated, “Which is why we have the confidence we can do this safely, because we have done it for over 10 years. We have been rigorously inspected by the Centers for Disease Control.”3

Vaccine Candidate to be Tested in Lab Animals

The measles-vector coronavirus vaccine candidate will be tested in animal models to determine whether or not lab animals produce antibodies to both the measles virus, which researchers are expecting that it should, and also antibodies against the novel coronavirus.1

"AstraZeneca Halts, Resumes COVID-19 Vaccine Trial After Serious...","News update, Sept. 15, 2020—U.S. regulators paused AstraZeneca’s vaccine trial in the U.S. while the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launches an investigation of its own into a serious side effect in an unnamed patient in Britain. “The highest levels of NIH are very concerned,” said Dr. Avindra Nath, intramural clinical director and a leader of viral research at the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, an NIH division. A great deal of uncertainty remains about what happened to the patient. AstraZeneca “need[s] to be more forthcoming with a potential complication of a vaccine which will eventually be given to millions of people,” said Dr. Nath. “We would like to see how we can help, but the lack of information makes it difficult to do so.”19 Enrollment of new patients and other trial procedures were being rescheduled until at least midweek although studies might take a month or two. The status of the South African and Indian trials remains unknown, but the trial in Brazil has also restarted.20

Multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca announced on Sept. 8, 2020 that it was putting a hold on a Phase 3 clinical trial testing its experimental AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) COVID-19 vaccine due to a suspected very serious adverse reaction in a female participant in the United Kingdom.1 In a private conference call on Sept. 9, AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot stated that the woman suffered symptoms consistent with a rare but serious neurological disorder called transverse myelitis, which causes inflammation of the spinal cord.2

Soriot also confirmed that the participant was injected with the company’s COVID-19 vaccine and not a placebo. Four days later, AstraZeneca released a statement3 that the trial in the U.K. would resume following confirmation by the Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) (Britain’s equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) that it was safe to do so. They provided no further details. Researchers running other clinical trials are now looking for similar cases of neurological reactions by combing through databases.4

“What we have here is a special set of circumstances where the whole world becomes involved in the conduct of a clinical trial,” Soriot said. “The reality is we all have to be very patient and see how it unfolds.”5

Another AstaZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Participant Developed Multiple Sclerosis

AstraZeneca’s public statements about the temporary pause in its COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial contain few details, and drug company officials will not publicly confirm that this is the second time it has stopped trials to investigate potential adverse health events occurring among participants.6 A woman in the U.K. trial was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in July, but the company said that serious adverse event, which triggered the first clinical trial pause, was not related to the vaccine.7

AstraZeneca’s clinical trial is the first Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial publicly acknowledged to have been put on hold. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), such holds are not uncommon. Francis Collins, MD, director of the NIH, told a U.S. Senate panel last week:

To have a clinical hold, as has been placed on AstraZeneca as of yesterday, because of a single serious adverse event is not at all unprecedented. This certainly happens in any large-scale trial where you have tens of thousands of people invested in taking part, some of them may get ill and you always have to try to figure out: Is that because of the vaccine, or were they going to get that illness anyway?8

AstraZeneca Seeks 30,000 Participants for U.S. Phase 3 Trial

In April, Oxford University’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group partnered with AstraZeneca to develop, manufacture, and distribute ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein.9

AstraZeneca, which sponsors the clinical trials, began Phase 3 trials in the U.S. in late August. Phase 3 trials confirm and expand the evidence base for safety and efficacy of Phase 1 and 2 trials. The U.S. trial, which aims to enroll about 30,000 participants, is currently taking place at 62 sites across the country, according to clinicaltrials.gov, a government registry, though some sites have not yet started enrolling participants. Simultaneously conducted Phase 2/3 trials were previously started in the U.K., Brazil, and South Africa.10

Transverse Myelitis Is A Rare But Serious Neurological Disorder

Transverse myelitis involves inflammation of the spinal cord, which carries signals to and from the brain through nerves that extend from each side of the spinal cord and connect to nerves elsewhere in the body. Symptoms of transverse myelitis include pain that can be sharp or blunt and may shoot down arms and legs or wrap around the trunk or chest; sensory problems such as tingling, numbness, pricking, coldness, burning and sensitivity to touch or temperature; weakness in the legs and possibly the arms causing loss of balance, difficulty walking, and loss of function, which may develop into paralysis; bladder and bowel problems such as constipation, incontinence, or frequent need to urinate; and sexual dysfunction. These problems may develop suddenly over a period of hours, or over days or weeks.11

About 1,400 new cases of transverse myelitis are diagnosed each year in the United States. Although some people recover from transverse myelitis with minor or no residual problems, the healing process may take months to years. Others may suffer permanent impairments that affect their ability to perform ordinary tasks of daily living. There is no cure for transverse myelitis.12

A 2018 study published in the journal Neurology, which examined evidence for a causal relationship between transverse myelitis and vaccination, concluded that: “the unbalanced distribution of these cases in the first 6 weeks after vaccination suggests that the association between vaccination and some cases may not be coincidental. Work is in progress to determine association of individual vaccine types with the course of TM.”13

High Percentage of Local and Systemic Side Effects in AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine Trial

Preliminary results of the AstraZeneca’s Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials were published in The Lancet14 in July 2020. There were 1,077 healthy adults ages 18 to 55, who were randomly given either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or the meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine. Local and systemic reactions were more common in the trial group given the experimental COVID-19 vaccine, and a portion of both groups received prophylactic paracetamol (acetaminophen) before vaccinations were administered.

Fatigue and headache were the most commonly reported systemic reactions. Fatigue was reported in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group by 70 percent of the participants, who were not give paracetamol prior to vaccination, and in the MenACWY group by 48 percent of the participants without paracetamol. Headaches were reported in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group by 68 percent of the participants without paracetamol and 61 percent with paracetamol and in the MenACWY group by 41 percent of the participants without paracetamol and 37 percent of the participants with paracetamol.

Other systemic adverse reactions were common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine group: muscle ache—60 percent, malaise—61 percent, chills—56 percent, and feeling feverish—51 percent. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine group, 18 percent of participants without paracetamol and 16 percent of participants with paracetamol reported a temperature of at least 100.4°F, and two percent of patients without paracetamol had a temperature of at least 102.2°F. In comparison, less than one percent of those receiving MenACWY reported a fever of at least 100.4°F, none of whom were receiving prophylactic paracetamol.

The severity and intensity of local and systemic reactions was highest on the first day after vaccination.

Hold on AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Coincides with Historic Safety Pledge by Vaccine Companies

AstaZeneca put its trial on hold on Sunday, Sept. 6, but it was only made public following a news leak15 late on Tuesday, Sept. 8, the same day as nine pharmaceutical companies, including AstroZeneca, signed an historic pledge “to make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals the top priority in development of the first COVID-19 vaccines.”16 According to STAT News, the pledge was “an apparent attempt to provide public reassurance despite the widely held view that the COVID-19 vaccine development process is politically tainted.”17

U.S. Government Commits $1.2 Billion to Buy AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine

In May the U.S. government pledged to commit up to $1.2 billion to AstraZeneca to develop a coronavirus vaccine and to obtain at least 300 million doses of any COVID-19 vaccine the corporation gets licensed in 2020. The arrangement with AstraZeneca is labeled a public-private partnership and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) will provide technology transfers and scaled-up manufacturing.18

Novavax’s Adjuvanted COVID-19 Vaccine Caused Severe Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials,"Biotechnology company Novavax, Inc. of Gaithersburg, Maryland recently made public the results of the Phase 1 part of a Phase 1/2 human clinical trial for its experimental NVX-CoV2373 vaccine for COVID-19. According to Novavax, “NVX‑CoV2373 was created using Novavax’s recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and contains Novavax’s patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies.”1

The clinical trial involved 131 healthy adults between 18-59 years of age. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on Sept. 2, 2020.2

Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine Contains Strong Saponin-Based Adjuvant

Of the 131 participants in the clinical trial,, which began on May 26, 2020, 83 were given the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine containing the Matrix-M1 adjuvant to help stimulate an immune response to produce a strong antibody response. Matrix-M1 contains nm (nanometers) of nanoparticles composed of Quillaja saponins, cholesterol and phospholipid. Quillaja saponins are chemical compounds extracted from the soapbox tree. They are used by the food industry as “emulsifiers in beverages and food additives.”2 3 4 5 6

In the cosmetics industry, Quillaja saponins (from the Latin “sapo,” meaning soap) are used as “antidandruff, cleansing, emulsifying, foaming, masking, moisturizing, skin conditioning, and surfactant agents.”6

Of the remaining trial participants, 25 were given the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine without the Matrix-M1 adjuvant and 23 participants were given a placebo of sterile 0.9 percent normal saline. Each participant received two intrasmuscular injections in the deltoid muscle. The injections were given three weeks apart.2

Trial participants were divided into five group: group A, group B, group C, group D and group E. The 23 participants in group A received two doses of the placebo; 25 participants in group B received 25-μg (microgram) doses of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine without the Matrix-M1 adjuvant; 29 participants in group C received 5-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M1; 28 participants in group D received 25-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M1; and 26 participants in group E received a single 25-μg dose of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M1 followed by a single dose of placebo.2

Severe Adverse Events Occurred in Novavax’s COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Trials

According to the results of the clinical trial, two of the 83 participants (one each in groups D and E) suffered “severe adverse events” (headache, fatigue and malaise) after the first dose. Two participants—one each in groups A and E—had “reactogenicity events” (fatigue, malaise and tenderness). A reactogenicity event is an “expected” adverse event following vaccination.7 8

Following administration of the second dose, one participant in group D had a “severe local event” (tenderness) and eight participants—one or two in each group—had “severe systemic events.” The most common of these severe systemic events were joint pain and fatigue. One participant in group D developed a fever of 100.58°F.2

Flu Vaccination Associated With Increased Viral Shedding,"Opinion | When your body is infected with a disease-causing virus such as influenza, the virus is “shed” into the environment, via your saliva and other bodily fluids and skin lesions. If someone comes in contact with that shed virus, it’s possible that they, too, will become infected with the virus.

There’s still a lot of unknowns when it comes to viral shedding. How long a person sheds a virus, when shedding occurs and whether it occurs at the onset of symptoms or prior to symptoms, varies by virus and are influenced by a person’s age, health status and even weight.1

That viruses are shed from their hosts is common knowledge. However, the topic of viral shedding isn’t one you’ll hear about often when it comes to live attenuated viral vaccines, examples of which include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), vaccinia (smallpox), varicella, zoster (which contains the same virus as varicella vaccine but in much higher amount), yellow fever, rotavirus and influenza (intranasal).2

Live viral vaccines use a weakened (or attenuated) version of the virus, which is typically passed through a living cell culture or other host, such as chicken embryo, many times over until it becomes weakened to a point that it’s not likely to make you sick when it’s injected, swallowed or inhaled.

That being said, it’s still a live vaccine-strain virus—one that can be shed like any virus—and research suggests that vaccination may increase viral shedding in the case of influenza.3

Flu Vaccine Recipients Shed 6.3 Times More Virus into the Air

In a study published in PNAS, University of Maryland researchers revealed not only that influenza virus may be spread via simple breathing (i.e., no sneezing or coughing required) but also that repeated vaccination increases the amount of influenza virus released into the air.4

“Little is known about the amount and infectiousness of influenza virus shed into exhaled breath. This contributes to uncertainty about the importance of airborne influenza transmission,” the researchers noted. “We show that sneezing is rare and not important for—and that coughing is not required for—influenza virus aerosolization.”5

This is important, as it means that even someone who’s not actively sneezing or coughing can still potentially transmit the influenza virus to others.

Further, someone who’s recently received the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) may also potentially actively shed and transmit the virus. According to the study, in fact, people who were vaccinated for influenza shed more than six times more virus into the air than those who were not:6

Self-reported vaccination for the current season was associated with a trend toward higher viral shedding in fine-aerosol samples; vaccination with both the current and previous year’s seasonal vaccines, however, was significantly associated with greater fine-aerosol shedding in unadjusted and adjusted models. In adjusted models, we observed 6.3 times more aerosol shedding among cases with vaccination in the current and previous season compared with having no vaccination in those two seasons.

Annual Vaccination May Actually Reduce Your Protection

Receiving a flu vaccination to prevent type A or B influenza is not nearly as cut-and-dry as health officials would have you believe. There are many unanswered questions that deserve further research, like the possibility that getting repeated annual flu shots may increase your susceptibility to influenza. In a 2013 study, it was found that those who received the influenza vaccine two years in a row got no significant protection during the current flu season.7 8

Another finding revealed by the study was that vaccination failed to prevent household transmission once influenza was introduced, with adults being particularly at risk despite vaccination.9 Again in 2019, researchers found that vaccine effectiveness was lower against certain types of flu (H3N2 and B) for those vaccinated during two consecutive flu seasons compared to those vaccinated in the current season only.10

The possibility that repeated vaccination may reduce effectiveness, and that annual vaccination may increase aerosol viral shedding, demands more investigation. According to the featured study researchers:11

The association of current and prior year vaccination with increased shedding of influenza A might lead one to speculate that certain types of prior immunity promote lung inflammation, airway closure, and aerosol generation. This first observation of the phenomenon needs confirmation. If confirmed, this observation, together with recent literature suggesting reduced protection with annual vaccination, would have implications for influenza vaccination recommendations and policies.

It’s possible, for instance, that after vaccination, you may become a contagious silent carrier of disease. A person with influenza who fully expresses symptoms of fever, body aches, cough and other signs of respiratory illness would likely stay at home.

However, a vaccinated individual, who is silently contagious, would go to work and into stores and other public places and be unaware they are spreading infection, which can be done even via regular breathing.

This is an especially important fact for vaccinated health care workers, who move freely among patients in hospitals and other medical facilities because everyone assumes vaccinated medical personnel are “immune” to influenza if they get a flu shot every year, even though they could potentially be transmitting influenza to hospital patients, including those in the ICU.

CDC: Virus Shedding ‘Common’ After Receipt of LAIV

Although you may be surprised to learn that virus shedding occurs after certain vaccinations, even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in their “Safety of Influenza Vaccines” report for professionals,12 states that shedding of the live attenuated vaccine virus is “common” after receipt of LAIV. They cite numerous studies confirming as such, including:

Among 345 LAIV3 recipients, 29% had detectable virus in their nasal secretions, with maximal shedding occurring within two days of vaccination 13

In a study of 200 children aged 6 months through 59 months, 79% shed at least one vaccine virus; shedding was most common among younger children, with 89% of 6- to 23-month-olds shedding at least one vaccine virus14

The live influenza vaccine is FluMist, which is approved for nonpregnant women as well as anyone aged 2 to 49 years. It’s administered in the form of a nasal spray.

While the CDC states that the live type A and B vaccine strain influenza viruses in FluMist are too weak to actually give recipients influenza, according to the CDC, “transmission of shed LAIV vaccine viruses from vaccine recipients to unvaccinated persons has been documented …”15

MedImmune, the company that developed FluMist, is also aware that the vaccine sheds vaccine-strain virus. In its prescribing information, they describe a study on the transmission of vaccine-strain influenza viruses from vaccinated children to nonvaccinated children in a day care setting.

In 80% of the FluMist recipients, at least one vaccine-strain influenza virus was isolated anywhere from one to 21 days following vaccination. They further noted, “One placebo subject had mild symptomatic Type B virus infection confirmed as a transmitted vaccine virus by a FluMist recipient in the same playgroup.”16

How Often Does Vaccine Virus Transmission Occur?

According to the CDC, “The estimated probability of transmission of vaccine virus within a contact group with a single LAIV recipient in this population [a child care center] was 0.58%,” however in a child care setting it’s likely that multiple children would have received LAIV at any given time.17

However, there’s no way to know for sure how often vaccine-strain live virus shedding and disease transmission actually occurs, since it’s not being actively monitored or tested for.

Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), wrote a special report, “The Emerging Risks of Live Virus and Viral Vectored Vaccines: Vaccine Strain Virus Infection, Shedding and Transmission,” which contains over 200 references and delves into virus shedding and vaccine virus shedding. She noted:18

There is no active surveillance and testing for evidence of vaccine strain live virus shedding, transmission and infection among populations routinely being given multiple doses of live virus vaccines, including measles vaccine. Therefore, it is unknown exactly how many vaccinated children and adults in the U.S. or other countries are shedding and transmitting vaccine strain live viruses. Whether or not vaccine strain live virus shedding, transmission and infection is causing undiagnosed or misdiagnosed health problems, especially among people with severe immune deficiencies or autoimmune and other immune system disorders, is an open question.

A Live Attenuated COVID-19 Vaccine Is Being Produced

The featured study has implications for COVID-19, which is still a mystery in terms of transmission and treatment. It’s unknown, for instance, if Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has airborne transmission potential in addition to being spread by more direct contact or droplets.

Airborne transmission appears likely,19 however, raising even more concerns considering the development of a live attenuated COVID-19 vaccine has begun.

In June 2020, biotechnology company Meissa Vaccines announced that it has initiated preclinical studies and manufacturing of a live attenuated COVID-19 vaccine,20 which was derived by modifying the company’s live attenuated RSV vaccine candidate.

Whether a live attenuated COVID-19 vaccine will end up causing recipients to shed vaccine-strain virus into the air remains to be seen, but there are inherent risks. Even Martin Moore, PhD, co-founder and CEO of Meissa Vaccines, told BioSpace about the potential for virus shedding. BioSpace reported:21

Moore explained that if a virus is attenuated based on one or two gene mutations, the virus could revert to being infectious in the vaccine recipient and they can shed live virus, spreading it to others. This is the worst-case scenario and why there are such strict safety standards for vaccines, especially LAVs [live attenuated vaccines]. ‘Safety is critical, there are no cutting corners with safety,’ explained Moore. ‘Coronaviruses, in particular, are prone to genetic recombination, so using a live attenuated coronavirus in a vaccine would run the risk of becoming infectious again.’

In terms of both influenza and any novel COVID-19 vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the CDC, it’s important to be aware of the differences between attenuated live virus vaccines and inactivated vaccines, especially if you’re in a vulnerable population, such as very young children, the elderly, pregnant and breastfeeding women and people with acute or chronic health problems or a compromised immune system.

There remain many unanswered questions regarding live virus vaccines and their ultimate impact on public health.

U.S. Troops Will Be Among the First to Get COVID-19 Vaccine,"Senior White House officials reported that United States service members would be among the first Americans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after it has been licensed. Officials said the groups likely to receive the vaccine first include the most vulnerable people such as the elderly, patients with underlying health conditions, employees in essential businesses and the U.S. military.​1

The Department of Defense’s Role in Operation Warp Speed

Operation Warp Speed (OWS) under way at the federal level is a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and has a goal of delivering 300 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine by January 2021. Meeting that goal is part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.2

The U.S. military is playing a significant role in OWS. General Gustave Perna is chief operating officer of OWS. Army Lieutenant General Paul Ostrowski is leading the supply, production and distribution directorate, and Army Brigadier General Michael McCurry is leading the security assurance directorate. In addition, 36 additional Department of Defense personnel are working on the OWS.3

The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) announced that it has selected a lead vaccine candidate among the many experimental COVID-19 vaccines that Army researchers have been working on since the beginning of the year. They plan on testing leading candidate vaccines in human trials in late 2020.4

Brigadier General Michael J. Talley, the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USMRDC) said:

USAMRDC is moving at unprecedented speeds in the effort to prevent, detect,

and treat COVID-19. We are supporting the whole-of-government response with

the scientific knowledge and expertise to combat this world-wide challenge.5

COVID-19 Survivors Initially Banned From Joining the Military

In early May 2020, the U.S. military banned the enlistment of any person who had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The military released a new guidance for examining an applicant’s medical history of the disease during the screening.6

A memo by the United States Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) posted on Military Times stated, “During the prescreen process, a reported history of confirmed COVID-19 will be annotated as ‘Considered Disqualifying’”.​7

People already enlisted in the military who were hospitalized with COVID-19 would not automatically be disqualified from further service. Depending on the service member’s heath after treatment, they could return to duty or take a less physically demanding job. Recruits who had suffered severe complications that left them with continuing health problems would be evaluated by a medical board to determine if they can continue serving.8

Uproar Over Ban on U.S. Military Service After COVID-19 Infections

Following the original memo by USMEPCOM and in response to public uproar, the Pentagon rescinded the policy that prevented recruits who had been infected with COVID-19 from enlisting or earning a military commission.​9

Matthew P. Donovan, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness said that he had canceled the guidance in favor of reverting back to pre-coronavirus accessions standards. He said, “At the same time, we’re having our health professionals and our doctors and researchers take a look at that and come up with any recommendations that they’ll provide to me and the [defense] secretary,”​10

He said a final decision is yet to be made. In the meantime, the policy is to evaluate each recruit on a case-by-case basis.​11

Congressman Andy Biggs (R-Arizona) wrote to Defense Secretary Dr. Mark Esper stating:

If an individual can pass the Military Entrance Processing Station screening process―despite a hospitalization for coronavirus―they should be allowed to serve.​12

He added that, “I agree that more research is needed to study the long-term effects of coronavirus on the human body. However, I do not think that the lack of research available warrants permanently disqualifying patriotic Americans from serving in the military.”13

Israeli Woman Treated with COVID-19 “Passive Vaccine”,"Hadassah Medical Center in partnership with the Israeli biotechnology company Kamada Ltd. in Jerusalem, Israel treated its first COVID-19 patient with what it described as a “passive vaccine.”1 Reportedly, a young female suffering from several underlying medical conditions, who had been hospitalized for several weeks and intubated, was passively vaccinated by injecting antibodies from a person who had recovered from COVID-19.2

What Is a “Passive Vaccine”?

According to The Jerusalem Post, passive vaccination is also known as immunoglobulin therapy or transfusion of convalescent plasma. For example, tetanus immune globulin is used to prevent tetanus infection (also known as lockjaw), which gives passive protection that lasts long enough until the patient’s body can produce its own antibodies against tetanus.3

Active vaccination to prevent a viral infection occurs when a person is injected with a live, attenuated or inactivated virus, which manipulates the immune system into thinking the patient has had the infectious disease and vaccine strain antibodies and artificial immunity are produced.4

First Hospital in the World to Administer Immunoglobulin G

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hadassah Medical Center began collecting plasma rich with antibodies from coronavirus patients who had recovered from the infection with the goal of producing a treatment for severely ill COVID-19 patients.5 The plasma collected from the recovered patients was processed by Kamada, Ltd. to produce an IgG-based antibody treatment for coronavirus patients in severe conditions.6

The first dose of the “passive vaccine” was provided to a young woman with a pre-existing medical condition whose computerized tomography (CT) scan showed white lungs, an indication that she was critically ill with the infection. All of the known treatments for coronavirus, including the use of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine, had not improved her condition.7

Several hours after she received the immunoglobulin, it was observed that the patient’s condition stabilized, leading physicians to become cautiously optimistic.8

Kamada Announces Compassionate Use for Its IgG Therapy for COVID-19

In June 2020, Kamada completed manufacturing its first batch of a plasma-derived IgG product for COVID-19 utilizing the company’s proprietary IgG platform technology. Additional production is ongoing and the first vials are now available for compassionate use in Israel.9 Compassionate drug use is the use of a new, unapproved drug to treat a seriously ill patient when no other treatments are available.10

Kamada To Expand Its IgG Therapy to the United States

In order to expand its clinical development program to the U.S., Kamada, with the support of Kedrion Biopharma based in New Jersey, intends to conduct a pre-Investigational New Drug (pre-IND) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to obtain FDA’s approval of the proposed clinical development program.11

Kedrion is currently collecting COVID-19 convalescent plasma from U.S. recovered patients that will be used by Kamada to manufacture additional vials of the product. Kedrion is collecting the plasma through its plasma business unit, KEDPLASMA, at 23 FDA approved centers across the U.S.12

Massachusetts Health Care Workers Refusing Free Flu Shots,"Story Highlights Hundreds of health care workers in Massachusetts are declining the annual flu shot.

Health care worker flu shot requirements vary from state to state.

A recent study questions the scientific validity of mandating annual influenza vaccinations for hospital workers.

Hundreds of health care workers in Massachusetts, including those in nursing homes and kidney dialysis centers, are declining free annual flu shots, according to a report cited by the Boston Globe.1 The report, which tracks vaccination coverage of health workers in Massachusetts, found that health care worker vaccination rates in ambulatory care facilities and long-term care facilities were 79.8 percent and 67.9 percent respectively, falling short of 90 percent coverage goals set by federal government officials in the Healthy People 2020 initiative.2

In response to the low vaccination rates among health workers, Massachusetts regulators are increasing their efforts to improve vaccination rates by sending reminder letters to facilities that did not report their vaccination numbers, visiting kidney dialysis centers to review vaccination policies and also providing cash incentives to nursing homes to improve their health care worker vaccination rates.1

Massachusetts does not require health care workers get an annual flu shot.3 However, in 2008, Massachusetts Department of Public Health mandated that all licensed health care facilities offer staff the annual influenza vaccinations for free. Facilities are required to document and report receipt of influenza vaccine by staff as well as the number of staff members who decline vaccination.2

“Some of our staff decline vaccination for religious or health reasons and others are concerned that the vaccine is ineffective or dangerous,”1 said Tara Gregorio, president of the Massachusetts Senior Care Association,

Health Worker Flu Shot Requirements Vary According to State

The Journal Gazette reports that public health experts say doctors, nurses and other staff who work with patients play a role in stopping the spread of the influenza virus.4

Eighteen states have laws mandating influenza vaccination for hospital health care workers. These laws establish requirements based on the hospital type and the type of vaccination requirements.5 There are 32 states with no regulations requiring health care providers to be vaccinated or have hospitals developing guidelines for which employees should get flu shots.4

“Very few states set out requirements in statute when it comes to vaccination requirements for hospital employees,”5 said, Dixie Platt, Vice President of Communications and Federal Relations for the Indiana Hospital Association. “It appears that in most states, hospitals work with the department of health or other regulatory bodies, as is the case in Indiana, in addition to complying with federal rules related to infection control.”4

Flu Vaccine Now Mandatory for Health Workers in New Jersey

New Jersey recently passed and signed a law that requires all health care workers at hospitals, nursing homes and licensed home health care agencies to get an annual influenza vaccination.6 The bill A1576 passed the Assembly on Dec. 16, 2019 and was enacted into law by Governor Phillip Murphy on Jan. 13, 2020.7

The bill defines a health care worker as anyone employed by a health care facility that provides direct patient care or has contact with patients.6 Thomas Giblin, who was the primary sponsor of the bill, said, “Annual flu vaccinations have been recommended for health care providers by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1981. However, only 78.4 percent of health care workers in the U.S. reported receiving the flu vaccine during the 2017-18 seasons. Requiring health care providers to get the flu shot each year will potentially help reduce cases of the flu in hospitals, care facilities and the greater community.”8

Health care workers in New Jersey who do not wish to be vaccinated must submit a request for a medical exemption.6 The law requires any employee who does not receive an influenza vaccine to wear a surgical when in direct contact with patients and in common areas, as specified in facility policy or to be removed from direct patient care responsibilities during influenza season.6

Study Questions Scientific Validity of Mandating Annual Flu Shots for Health Care Workers

A 2017 study published in PLOS One questions the scientific validity of annual influenza vaccine mandates for all hospital workers. The flu vaccination policy, which is often a condition of employment, has been based on the assumption that it reduces influenza-associated morbidity and mortality among hospital patients.9

To justify mandatory influenza vaccination policies for health workers, employers usually point to four cluster randomized control trials (cRCT) conducted in long-term care facilities. The PLOS study reveals that the methodology used in all four cRCTs has been found to be flawed. None of the studies were conducted in hospital settings.9

One of the cRCT’s from Great Britain calculates that one death from influenza can be avoided for every eight health care workers vaccinated. If this calculation were true, then vaccinating all 1.7 million long-term care workers in the United States should prevent 212,500 patient deaths from influenza. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates between 3,000 to 49,000 deaths from the flu per year, depending upon the influenza strain circulating in a given flu season, and that estimate includes people of all ages.9

If this were to be extrapolated to the 5.5 million hospital workers in the U.S., it would mean that 687,500 patient deaths from influenza could be prevented. This figure is more than the number of Americans that died in the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic.9

In an article in STAT News, Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy stated, “The study today does not refute that vaccination could have some impact on reducing transmission from infected health care workers to patients. But it clearly shows there’s no well-conducted study that demonstrates that at this time. Our public policy should be guided as such.”10

New CDC Data Shows 94 Percent of COVID-19 Death Cases Had Underlying Poor Health Conditions,"The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Sept. 2 weekly update on COVID-19 mortality in the U.S., which is published by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), reported 170,566 deaths “involving COVID-19” that occurred between Feb. 1, 2020 and Aug. 29, 2020.1 During the same time period there were 1,841,678 deaths from all causes. About 94 percent of the death cases confirmed to be COVID-19-related involved other coinciding infections or underlying poor health conditions, including influenza, pneumonia, hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease.

Child Deaths from COVID-19 Rare

Of the deaths involving COVID-19, 79 percent were over age 65 and 31 percent were over age 85. Children under age 14 accounted for 0.00035 percent of deaths.

Fifty four percent of all deaths involving COVID-19 were male. Provisional death reports for COVID-19 peaked on Mar. 18, 2020, which also coincides with the peak for deaths from all causes in the United States.2 Hispanic and non-Hispanic black residents experienced disproportionate deaths involving COVID-19.3

Most COVID-19 Deaths in Nursing Hospitals, Inpatient Facilities

Almost 65 percent of deaths involving COVID-19 occurred in a nursing home or other inpatient healthcare facility, whereas 29 percent of all-cause deaths during the same period occurred in an inpatient setting. Roughly 21 percent of COVID-19 deaths occurred in nursing homes, while approximately 18 percent of all-cause deaths occurred in nursing homes.

Home is the most common location (33.6 percent) for people who die of all causes in the U.S.4

94 Percent of COVID-19 Death Cases Had Other Underlying Health Problems

For six percent of the coronavirus-associated deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For COVID-19-related death cases in persons who had other infections or conditions in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per COVID-related death. The most common respiratory conditions included influenza, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

Comorbid circulatory diseases included hypertension, cardiac arrest, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmia. Approximately 16 percent of the death certificates listed diabetes, and 11 percent stated that vascular and unspecified dementia contributed or was the cause of death. Three percent had intentional or unintentional injury, poisoning or other type of adverse event listed.5

Reports of COVID-19 Deaths Based on Provisional Data

The NCHS uses incoming data from death certificates to produce provisional COVID-19 death counts.6 These include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

When COVID-19 is reported as a cause of death—or when it is listed as a “probable” or “presumed” cause—the death is coded using a new ICD-10 code, and this code can include cases with or without laboratory confirmation.

Provisional death counts may not match counts from other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Counts by NCHS often track 1–2 weeks behind other data, and may be delayed for the following reasons:

Death certificates take time to be completed. There are many steps to filling out and submitting a death certificate. Waiting for test results can create additional delays.

States report at different rates. Currently, 63 percent of all U.S. deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, but there is significant variation between states.

It takes extra time to code COVID-19 deaths. While 80 percent of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded by a person, which takes an average of seven days.

Other reporting systems use different definitions or methods for counting deaths.

Provisional counts are not final and are subject to change. Counts from previous weeks are continually revised as more records are received and processed. Counts do not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for more recent periods.

However, NCHS estimates how complete their numbers are by looking at the average number of deaths reported in previous years. Death counts should not be compared across states since some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly. State vital record reporting may also be affected or delayed by COVID-19 related response activities.

CDC Guidelines for Certifying Coronavirus Deaths

Death certificates contain two parts. Part I is for reporting the sequence of conditions that led directly to death. The immediate cause of death, which is the disease or condition that directly preceded death and is not necessarily the underlying cause of death (UCOD), are reported first and the conditions that led to the immediate cause of death should be reported in a logical sequence in terms of time and etiology below it. The UCOD, which is “the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or… the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury,” should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I.7

Other significant conditions that contributed to the death, but are not a part of the sequence in Part I, should be reported in Part II. Not all conditions present at the time of death have to be reported—only those conditions that actually contributed to death.8

In cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), CDC reporting guidelines state:

It is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as “probable” or “presumed.” In these instances, certifiers should use their best clinical judgement in determining if a COVID–19 infection was likely. However, please note that testing for COVID-19 should be conducted whenever possible.9

Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications at the NCHS, said that, while 94 percent of death certificates that mention COVID-19 also listed other conditions, the underlying cause of death was COVID-19 in almost all of them. “ The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death,” he said. “In 92 percent of all deaths that mention COVID-19, COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause of death.”10

Are CDC guidelines used to “pad” COVID-19 numbers?

Scott Jensen, MD, a family physician and Minnesota state senator, has publicly challenged the CDC’s guidelines for permitting presumed or probable cases of COVID to be listed on death certificates, saying they are “ridiculous” and could be misleading the public. Dr. Jensen states that the CDC’s death certificate manual tells physicians to focus on “precision and specificity,” but the coronavirus death certification guidance runs completely counter to that axiom.11

Dr. Jensen also reacted to Dr. Anthony Fauci’s response to a question about the potential for the number of coronavirus deaths being “padded,” in which the NIAID director described the prevalence of “conspiracy theories” during “challenging” times in public health. Dr. Jensen said:

I would remind him that anytime health care intersects with dollars it gets awkward. Right now Medicare has determined that if you have a COVID-19 admission to the hospital you’ll get paid $13,000. If that COVID-19 patient goes on a ventilator, you get $39,000; three times as much. Nobody can tell me, after 35 years in the world of medicine, that sometimes those kinds of things [don’t have] impact on what we do.

Most Americans Live with Chronic Disease

That so many COVID-19 deaths are associated with chronic disease highlights the risk factor inherent in underlying poor health conditions. The CDC reports that six in ten Americans lives with a chronic disease, and four in ten have two or more. These chronic diseases—heart, lung and kidney disease, cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease—are the leading cause of death and disability, and are the leading drivers in the nation’s $3.5 trillion in annual health care costs,12 as well as raise the risk of severe illness from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection.13

Obesity is one of the most common underlying conditions increasing one’s risk for severe illness and about 40 percent of U.S. adults are obese. The more underlying medical conditions people have, the higher their risk.14

The T-Cell Response to COVID-19 Infections and Immunity,"Story Highlights Rapid decline of neutralizing antibodies following COVID-19 infection in some people have led to concerns that immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus Is temporary.

However, several recent studies have shown a presence of virus-specific T-cells that remain, including among patients with mild or asymptomatic infections.

Long-lasting immunity after recovery from COVID-19 infection may be significantly higher than antibody testing alone would indicate and contribute to population based herd immunity.

Research into the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has primarily focused on analyzing the blood of patients, who have recovered from COVID-19, to measure whether they have developed neutralizing antibodies to the virus. A key finding early in the pandemic was that any antibodies produced tend to be very short-lived.1

Several recent studies, however, have shown “encouraging signs of strong, lasting immunity,” including in patients who have had mild cases of COVID-19.2 One of the studies, which has not yet been peer reviewed, reported finding that, “immunity is durable for at least several months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.”3

A study currently under review by the journal Nature, found that, “recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG (Immunoglobulin G ) antibody and neutralizing plasma, as well as virus-specific memory B- and T-cells that not only persisted, but in some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset.”4 This is the information researchers have been looking for to determine whether those who recover from mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 develop a strong and durable immunity that could lead to reduced transmission and ultimately to true population based herd immunity.5

Antibodies are Not the Only Important Players in Developing Immunity

As explained by viral immunologist Zania Stamataki, PhD, there are two major types of “memory” immune responses that allow the body to recognize and quickly mount a protective response to a microbial infection.6 Among many other tools available in the complex human immune system, one type of response is powered by B-cells, which produce antibodies. Another type is the T-cell response, which may involved either a “killer T-cell” that causes the destruction of infected cells or a “helper T-cell” that triggers B-cells to produce new antibodies.7

T-cell activation is reportedly common in patients with COVID-19 and has been seen in early results of vaccine trials. T-cell activation may be able to prevent a second infection even in the absence of antibodies. If SARS-CoV-2 follows the pattern of other coronaviruses, memory T-cells may last longer than antibodies.8

A study conducted by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found that for every one person who tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, two were found to have T-cells specific for the virus. The study also found that patients with severe disease were likely to develop higher levels of antibodies and T-cells, while those with mild or asymptomatic disease generally had lower levels of antibodies but still showed a strong T-cell response. Routine antibody testing would fail to identify patients who do not have antibodies but do have the T-cells that could provide protection from COVID-19 infection and transmission.9

According to Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren, MD, PhD, senior co-author of the Swedish study:

Our results indicate that public immunity to COVID-19 is probably significantly higher than antibody tests have suggested… If this is the case, it is of course very good news from a public health perspective.10

T-Cell Cross-Reactivity May Be Linked to Infection With the Common Cold

Another preprint study out of the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, Germany found that 15 of 18 hospitalized patients had helper T-cells specific to the spike protein on the virus. Questioning whether those who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 might still produce the cells to fight infection, Andreas Thiel, PhD and fellow researchers found that 34 percent of 68 uninfected people had helper T-cells able to recognize SARS-CoV-2. This cross-reactivity was also identified in about half of stored blood samples from 2015 to 2018—before the world had heard of COVID-19.

The researchers suggested that these cells were probably generated in response to a previous infection with one of the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold, explaining that proteins in the other coronaviruses resemble those of SARS-CoV-2.

Viral immunologist Steven Varga, PhD of the University of Iowa proposes that, “one reason that a large chunk of the population may be able to deal with the virus is that we may have some small residual immunity from our exposure to common cold viruses.”11

Dangers of Methanol-Containing Hand Sanitizers,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials have maintained that people can use hand sanitizers as an alternative for hand washing to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the widespread use of commercial disinfectant products is leading to another problem,1 and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now warning consumers and health care professionals to stop using certain alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing methanol, also known as wood alcohol, because it can cause alcohol poisoning.2

According to agency officials, these hand sanitizers contain as much as up to 81 percent of methanol.3 The FDA has identified over 100 hand sanitizers on their “Do Not Use” list to avoid using, either because they contain toxic levels of ingredients or have alcohol levels that are too low to be protective.4

Methanol Toxicity: From Nausea to Loss of Consciousness

The FDA has stated that methanol is a substance often used to create fuel and antifreeze that can be toxic when absorbed through the skin as well as life-threatening when ingested.5

Dr. Michael Dannenberg, the chair of dermatology at Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, California stated, “Methanol can dehydrate the skin, causing dry skin, and can result in dermatitis to the affected region. The main problem with methanol is that it is absorbed through the skin and can result in toxic levels of this chemical.”6

FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said, “Although people using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young children who ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol [ethanol] substitute are most at risk.”7

Some of the symptoms of methanol poisoning include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, weakness, visual disturbances, and loss of consciousness.8

According to the FDA, in most hand sanitizers, methanol does not appear to be listed as an ingredient on the product label. However, even if it is listed as an ingredient on the product label, methanol is not an approved ingredient in any drug, including hand sanitizers.9

Poison Control Centers Report Increase in Calls

During the pandemic, poison control centers have had an increase in calls about accidental ingestion of hand sanitizer. In March 2020, as concerns about the new novel coronavirus were growing, calls to poison control center surged 80 percent compared to a year ago. This caught the attention of FDA regulators, who noted that most of the nearly 3,300 cases that month involved young children.10

In response to the increasing number of poisoning incidents, the FDA stepped up testing of commercial hand sanitizer products, including shipments made by some of the 1,500 manufacturers that took advantage of high demand and widespread shortage of hand sanitizer.11

Testing Guidance On Alcohol in Hand Sanitizers Updated

On Aug. 7, 2020, the FDA issued updated guidance to provide additional clarification on testing of alcohol used in hand sanitizers manufactured under FDA’s temporary policies to help ensure that harmful levels of methanol are not present in these products.12

The FDA provided clarification that companies must test each lot of the active ingredient (ethanol or isopropyl alcohol) for methanol if the ethanol or isopropyl alcohol is obtained from another source.13Additionally, any alcohol (ethanol or isopropyl alcohol) found to contain more than 630 ppm methanol does not comply with the policies described in the FDA’s temporary guidance and may be considered evidence of substitution and/or contamination.

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers that are contaminated with methanol are subject to adulteration charges under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act.14

U.S. Southeast and Rural Areas Have More Severe COVID-19 Tied to...,"Story Highlights Certain co-existing health problems like obesity and diabetes and lung, heart and kidney disease have been associated with increased risk for severe symptoms and death from COVID-19.

A recent CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report reported that underlying conditions contributing to greater risk for severe COVID-19 disease are more prevalent in the southeast and in rural areas of the U.S.

Recognizing that the report has limitations due to study design and incomplete knowledge about COVID-19, the authors hope the findings will help guide state and local governments in identifying geographical areas in need of additional support and allocation of resources.

Some of the health conditions recognized to be associated with more serious COVID-19 illness—and the worst outcomes—are obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.1 An updated study released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the July 24, 2020 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) suggests that those “comorbidities” are disproportionately affecting rural areas of the United States, most significantly those in the Southeast.2

Defining severe COVID-19 disease as “illness requiring hospitalization, intensive care estimated a median county-level prevalence of almost half (47.2 percent) for presence of any of the identified risk factors. The review relied on self-reported data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the U.S. Census, and weighted nationwide estimates of the target medical conditions, to estimate county-level prevalence for 3,142 counties in all 50 states and Washington DC.

Severe COVID-19 Disease More Prevalent Among Obese, Chronically Ill Americans Living in Southeast and Rural Areas

According to Robert Glatter, MD, an emergency medicine physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, given the high rates of obesity and other underlying conditions that can increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms in underserved rural areas, “It’s not surprising that the pandemic is hitting the southeast and rural communities particularly hard.”3 He added that, “we must allocate increased resources to populations in rural communities, which have a disproportionately larger percentage of chronic medical conditions. These communities are at higher risk for adverse outcomes and death from COVID-19 as transmission rates continue to increase.”

The CDC report found that obesity, with a median county prevalence of 35.4 percent, was the most common comorbidity associated with severe disease. Diabetes came next at 12.8 percent, followed by COPD at 8.9 percent, heart disease at 8.6 percent and chronic kidney disease at 3.4 percent. The CDC further reported that, while the estimated number of adults with any of the underlying conditions was higher in more populated areas, the prevalence increased in rural areas, ranging from 39.4 percent in large central metro counties to 48.8 percent in noncore counties.

The highest prevalence levels of any condition were found in Southeastern states, most notably in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and West Virginia, and some counties in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and northern Michigan.

Inflammation, Breathing Difficulties Associated with Obesity May Raise Risks for Severe COVID-19 Outcomes

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increasingly recognized role of obesity in severe COVID-19. Marc Siegel, MD, a professor of medicine at New York University’s Langone Medical Center in New York City suggests that inflammatory chemicals associated with obesity might “trigger or be associated with cytokine storm or the other inflammatory responses we see in COVID-19, including blood clotting.”4 Dr. Siegel says that the inability to fully inflate the lungs in the presence of obesity also may play a role.

Study Design Limitations, Need for More Research to Clarify Findings

The authors of the CDC’s report pointed out several limitations of the survey design that would be expected to affect interpretation of their findings. Some of the limitations listed included survey biases, incomplete information on other underlying conditions that also might be important, lack of a breakdown by subcategories of recognized comorbidities (such as type of diabetes or type of heart disease) and exclusion of at-risk populations such as those incarcerated or living in long-term care. They concluded:

These findings can be used by state and local decision-makers to help identify areas at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness because of underlying medical conditions and guide resource allocation and implementation of prevention and mitigation strategies.5

Tests for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea Can’t Distinguish Virus from...,"A team of South Korean infectious disease researchers has concluded there is no evidence that people can be reinfected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The researchers, led by Oh Myoung-don, MD, head of Seoul National University Hospital’s division of infectious diseases, believe that reports of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive again for SARS-CoV-2 were not due to reinfection or reactivation but, rather, to testing errors.1 2 3 4 5 6

According to Dr. Oh, the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests used to determine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and help diagnose cases of COVID-19 cannot distinguish between the virus and harmless fragments of the virus.1 2 3 4 5 6 Vaccine developer Seol Dai-wu of Chung-Ang University in Seoul, South Korea agrees. “The RT-PCR machine itself cannot distinguish an infectious viral particle versus a non-infectious virus particle, as the test simply detects any viral component,” Seol said.2

As immunologist Beda Stadler, PhD, former director of the University Institute of Immunology at the Insel Hospital in Bern, Switzerland notes, people who recovered from COVID-19 can still test positive for SARS-CoV-2 because…

… the coronavirus test measures only a very tiny tiny piece of the genome of the virus, and if your immune cells have killed the virus, then you have debris, you have rotten pieces of the nucleic acids in your blood and everywhere, and the assay can pick up these rotten pieces and then it look like as if you’re infected. You’re not. You have won the fight, you’re immune. So [the test] cannot discriminate.7

In a recent case involving 260 people in South Korea who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and recovered, tests detected fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus weeks after their recoveries. “The tests detected the ribonucleic acid of the dead virus,” Dr. Oh said.1 2 3 4 5 6 He added:

PCR testing that amplifies genetics of the virus is used in Korea to test COVID-19, and relapse cases are due to technical limits of the PCR testing. The respiratory epithelial cell has a half-life of up to three months, and RNA virus in the cell can be detected with PCR testing one to two months after the elimination of the cell.1 3 5 6

The findings by Dr. Oh and his research team have been confirmed by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). On May 18, 2020, the KCDC announced that it had studied 285 cases of patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and later tested positive again for the virus. Despite the positive tests, the agency determined that the patients were not contagious because they did not actually have the virus—that the PCR tests has “falsely identified dead viral matter as active COVID-19 infection.”8 9

The new research from South Korea has led to new protocols in that country for handling cases involving people who recovered from COVID-19, completed a period of isolation and then retested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Now, in South Korea, there is no longer a requirement for people, who have recovered from COVID-19 and gone through isolation, to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 before going back to work or school.9

Vitamin D Deficiency Studies and COVID-19,"Story Highlights During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical scientists have been closely examining the effects of vitamin D deficiency.

Meta-analyses of data from 45 studies have shown a significant correlation between vitamin D deficiency and more severe symptoms, complications and death from COVID-19.

Although laboratory studies on the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 are still in progress, previous studies have shown vitamin D supplementation to be protective against other acute respiratory tract infections in people who are vitamin D deficient.

Medical scientists investigating the association between vitamin deficiency and illness in humans have long known that adequate levels of vitamin D must be maintained for health. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were observations that people with vitamin D deficiency may be at greater risk for suffering complications and death.1 Recently, the scientific community has begun to take a closer look.2

Within the last month, three health organizations in the United Kingdom published reports advising people to make sure they maintain adequate levels of vitamin D, either through controlled sun exposure or vitamin D supplements. While cautioning that more research is needed, the Scientific Advisory Commission on Nutrition, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Royal Society discussed the health benefits of vitamin D.3

Study Found Correlation Between Vitamin D Deficiency and COVID-19 Mortality

Recently, researchers in Dallas, Texas analyzed data sets from ten European countries and found a strong correlation between severe vitamin D deficiency and death rate per million from COVID-19. Looking at data from the U.K., Ireland, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Estonia, the researchers concluded that the “correlation coefficient of 0.76 indicates that approximately 58% of COVID-19 mortality can be explained by severe deficiency in vitamin D.4

This study has not yet been peer reviewed, but the authors report the correlation was strong enough for them to recommend “universal screening for Vitamin D deficiency, and further investigation of vitamin D supplementation in randomized control studies, which may lead to possible treatment or prevention of COVID-19.”5

According to Adrian Martineau, PhD, professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, although there have been no laboratory studies specifically evaluating the effects of vitamin D on the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, studies have looked at the role of vitamin D levels in other respiratory viral infections. According to Dr. Martineau, those studies have shown that vitamin D metabolites “augment innate antiviral immune responses while simultaneously dampening down inflammation, which has been highlighted as a major problem in covid-19.”6 He added:

This combination of actions makes vitamin D an interesting candidate both as a potential tool in covid-19 prevention and as an adjunct to other therapies for people who already have the disease.

While some observational studies suggest that there may be an association between low vitamin D levels and higher rates of COVID-19 infection, others have found no correlation between vitamin D supplementation and risk for or severity of COVID-19.7

Evidence for Link Between Vitamin D Deficiency and Respiratory Infections

The link between vitamin D deficiency and severity of symptoms during respiratory infections has been well documented. As more public health agencies begin to look at the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation to treat or alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, previously published evidence for a link between vitamin D levels and other respiratory illnesses is being re-examined.

In 2017, a systematic review and meta-analysis of data on 10,933 patients from 25 randomized, controlled trials concluded that vitamin D supplementation was strongly protective against acute respiratory tract infection among all participants.8 This meta-analysis has garnered a lot of attention recently. According to the British Medical Journal, the article has been accessed on line more than 300,000 times since the beginning of the pandemic.9

This same analysis by Martineau et al., as well as three others that also reported a protective effect of vitamin D supplementation, were reviewed for the World Health Organization (WHO).10 In their commentary, the authors noted that in the 45 studies included in the various analyses, a consistent benefit was shown for vitamin D supplementation for preventing respiratory tract infection. Three showed a particular benefit in children younger than 16 years of age; two of the three reported that the protective effect was only seen with single daily doses but not with a bolus, or loading dose.

One of the reviews suggested that doses of 800 IU or less were protective, but higher doses were not. Noting that vitamin D deficiencies are common worldwide, reviewers concluded that further studies are needed to evaluate different doses and intervals of supplementation, as well as to determine whether there is any additional benefit to be had once vitamin D levels have been normalized.

Health Benefits of Vitamin D

An essential nutrient, vitamin D plays an important role in keeping a number of the body’s systems healthy. Besides promoting healthy bones and teeth, vitamin D also supports immune, brain and nervous system health, regulates insulin levels, supports lung and cardiovascular function.

Vitamin D is more accurately described as a prohormone, a precursor to a hormone, rather than a true vitamin solely obtained from food. Vitamin D is primarily generated in the human body through exposure to sunlight, though it also can be acquired through certain foods such as oily fish, red meat, egg yolks and fortified milk and juices.11

Explaining vitamin D’s critical effects on the immune system, Habib Sadeghi, DO states:

As an immunomodulator, it’s central to regulating the body’s immune response by interacting with immune cells that produce vitamin D-activating enzymes. In this way, vitamin D ensures the immune system remains in balance and reacts appropriately to various threats.12

Dr. Sadeghi adds that vitamin D also is known to have potent antimicrobial properties and was historically used successfully to treat infectious diseases, including tuberculosis and leprosy, before the introduction of antibiotics.

Causes of Vitamin D Deficiency

Several factors can contribute to decreased vitamin D levels. Both the increased levels of melanin in darker skin and the use of sunscreen, for example, can hamper the absorption of ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) rays from the sun necessary for the skin to produce vitamin D. Similarly, those who live at northern latitudes, those who work night shifts or are otherwise unable to get adequate sun exposure, and some babies who are exclusively breastfed may also develop vitamin D deficiency.13

However, too much vitamin D can cause toxicity, usually resulting from overuse of supplements, which can lead to dehydration, increased thirst, vomiting, abdominal cramps and mental confusion.14

Vitamin D deficiency is more common among people who smoke, as well as among those who are obese or have diabetes and high blood pressure—all chronic health conditions that have been associated with increased risks for COVID-19 complications and death. Some have speculated that during the winter months of 2020, with many people sheltering indoors, the chances of developing vitamin D deficiency were increased.15

There are currently 28 registered human clinical trials underway to evaluate the potential relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19. Results of those studies are expected to clarify whether supplemental vitamin D might have a positive role to play in the management of COVID-19 patients with low vitamin D levels.16

Study Shows Link Between Fine Particle Air Pollution and COVID-19...,"A new nationwide study conducted by researchers at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health is the first to show a statistical link between long-term exposure to pollution and COVID-19 death rates.1 The study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, shows that coronavirus patients living in areas that had high levels of air pollution before the pandemic are more likely to die from the infection than patients living in parts of the country with less air pollution.1

In the analysis, data was collected for approximately 3,000 counties in the United States (98 percent of the population) up to Apr. 4, 2020. The study revealed that higher levels of tiny, dangerous particles in air known as PM 2.5 were associated with higher death rates from the COVID-19 infection.

What is PM 2.5 ?

PM 2.5 is believed to be one of the world’s most dangerous air pollutants. It is made up of tiny particles (smaller than 2.5 micrometers) that can seep into human lungs and bloodstreams.2 The source of PM 2.5 is usually automobile exhaust and power plants, as well as toxic fine particle air pollution from burning wood and coal.

Several studies have linked high levels of PM 2.5 to heart disease, chronic bronchitis and other respiratory illnesses. It has been estimated that PM 2.5 contributed to 4.2 million deaths worldwide in 2015 alone.2

Study: Smallest Increase in PM 2.5 Can Increase COVID-19 Death Rates

The Harvard study reveals that even an increase in one microgram per cubic meter of air could potentially increase COVID-19 deaths by 15 percent even accounting for factors like smoking rates and population density.1 For example, the study found that an individual living in a county for decades with high levels of PM 2.5 is 15 percent more likely to die from the coronavirus than someone in a region with one unit less of the fine particulate pollution.3

According to Francesca Dominici, PhD, a professor of biostatistics at Harvard University and a principal investigator on the study, “This study provides evidence that counties that have more polluted air will experience higher risks of death for COVID-19.”3

The authors write:

The results of this study also underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations during the COVID-19 crisis. Based on our result, we anticipate a failure to do so can potentially increase the COVID-19 death toll and hospitalizations, further burdening our healthcare system and drawing resources away from COVID-19 patients.1

Study: Melatonin May Help Moderate COVID-19 Cytokine Storm,"Story Highlights Many of the serious side effects of COVID-19, including high fever, cough, shortness of breath, lung injuries and long-term lung fibrosis are symptoms of a cytokine storm, which is a hyper-inflammatory response to infection.

Melatonin, a hormone produced in the mitochondria and existing in almost all cells in all organisms, has been investigated as a potential therapy to calm the cytokine storm and moderate the most severe symptoms of COVID-19.

Melatonin is a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, has well-known anti-viral properties and aids in the sleep-wake cycle.

One of the primary processes by which COVID-19 induces serious illness is by initiating a hyper-inflammatory response known as a “cytokine storm,” or hypercytokinemia. A new study published in journal Medicine in Drug Discovery found that melatonin, an anti-inflammatory molecule produced by the body, may help prevent the cytokine storm that is associated with the most severe cases of COVID-19 infections.1

Cytokines are signaling proteins that affect the functioning of the immune system. Different types have different effects, i.e., some act to ramp up the inflammatory response of the immune system and others to slow it down. The release of cytokines is part of a normal immune system’s inflammatory response, but when the body releases too many too quickly, it results in a cytokine storm that can wreak havoc on the whole immune system.2

Many of the symptoms associated with serious COVID-19 infections, such as the high fever, lung injuries causing cough, shortness of breath and long-term lung fibrosis are indicative of a cytokine storm.3 Symptoms also may include inflammatory markers like redness and swelling, pronounced fatigue, nausea, enlarged spleen, excessive bleeding and low blood cell counts (red, white and platelets).4 5 If it remains unresolved, a cytokine storm can cause multiple organ failure and lead to death.

Melatonin is a Potential Ally

Numerous drugs and other forms of treatment are being evaluated for their potential use to prevent serious complications of COVID-19 infections. Since new therapies to treat COVID-19 couldn’t feasibly get through research, development and safety studies in time to help those who are infected now, medical researchers are particularly interested in tried and true therapies that might be effective right now. Broad-spectrum antiviral agents, some antibiotics and anti-parasitic medications are a few examples of proposed treatments being investigated.

Another is a proposal that melatonin, a molecule produced in the body that has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, may provide some protection against “catastrophic oxidative stress.”6

Melatonin was originally thought to derive exclusively from the pineal gland of vertebrates, but it was ultimately identified in prokaryotic bacteria, the precursors to mitochondria. Given the high levels of measurable melatonin in mitochondria, it was hypothesized and eventually documented that melatonin is produced in the mitochondria and exists in almost all cells in all organisms. 7 8 Ordinarily, mitochondrial melatonin would effectively counteract the cytokine storm, neutralize the free radicals being created and prevent the dramatic lung damage seen with COVID-19. However, one of the consequences of COVID-19 infection is a breakdown of the processes needed for macrophage mitochondria to synthesize melatonin.

With melatonin unavailable to mitigate the inflammation and neutralize reactive oxygen species, the environment is primed to allow for the severe respiratory tract damage that is one of the primary complications of COVID-19. Further, endogenous melatonin production is known to decrease with age and is significantly reduced in frail elderly patients, which helps explain the increased risk of serious complications and mortality from COVID-19 infections seen in older populations.

The study’s authors believe that treatment of COVID-19 with supplemental melatonin is a justifiable treatment that would be expected to reverse the chain-reaction of processes that obstruct the synthesis of natural mitochondrial melatonin. With that pathway restored, natural melatonin production would rebound and, together with supplemental melatonin, could provide “a formidable weapon to reduce the cytokine storm as well as its damaging consequences, thereby relieving the signs of a COVID-19 infection.”9

Melatonin is Getting the Attention of Scientists

Other scientists also have suggested that melatonin may have a place in the arsenal of therapies to help moderate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to its’ widely documented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, melatonin is also known to be an anti-viral agent that can be used to treat viral infections other than COVID-19.10 Known primarily as a natural sleep aid, melatonin acts to regulate sleep through its effects on the body’s biological clock and sleep-wake cycles. Like most hormones, its natural production follows a circadian rhythm, rising with the dark and ebbing with the coming of the light.11

Other properties of melatonin include promotion of cell growth, halting apoptosis (self-destruction of infected cells in an attempt to stop proliferation of the pathogen) and modulating immune system functions.12 It also reduces vessel permeability and its effects on mood could aid in the treatment of critical care patients by reducing anxiety, the need for sedation and improving their quality of sleep.13

Agreeing with conclusions made in other published reports,14 15 16 the authors of the study cite melatonin’s high safety profile, low cost, long shelf-life and ease of self-administration, adding, “the use of melatonin to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic would be feasible and a socially-responsible measure to attempt.”17

Vitamin D Benefits Confirmed by New COVID-19 Research,"Vitamin D, the fat-soluble hormone produced in the body when sunlight hits the skin, is responsible not only for bone health but is also believed to help regulate the immune and neuromuscular systems. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, depression, weight gain and other maladies.1

Research on Vitamin D has exploded in the last ten years, and not only is there a large and growing literature on Vitamin D’s role in reducing the risk of acute respiratory infections and reducing morbidity and mortality in critical care settings,2 but new research confirms a relationship between vitamin D levels and the respiratory illness believed to be caused by the novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2.3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Vitamin D levels correlated with health outcomes in COVID-19 patients

In a study10 published on May 6, researchers reviewed data from 20 European countries. Vitamin D levels are severely low in some aging populations, especially in Spain, Italy and Switzerland, whereas Vitamin D levels were higher in the Nordic countries. The study found a negative correlation between mean levels of Vitamin D and number of cases of COVID-19 and mortality from the new coronavirus.

The authors suggested that Southern European countries have lower levels of vitamin D because of decreased exposure to the sun (because people prefer the shade) and darker skin pigmentation, which decreases Vitamin D synthesis. Northern Europe’s levels are better due to the consumption of cod liver oil, vitamin supplements, and Vitamin D fortification of milk and milk products. Furthermore, they suggested that Vitamin D has a modulating effect on inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and ACE2, which protects against lung injury.

A small, retrospective observational study11 conducted at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center found the baseline prevalence of Vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) among ICU patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) for any cause is 30 to 40 percent, whereas for patients in ICU units with COVID-19, 84.6 percent had VDI. This is in contrast to only 57.1 percent of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized on general floors testing positive for Vitamin D insufficiency.

Strikingly, 100 percent of ICU patients less than 75 years old had Vitamin D insufficiency. Authors of this study believe their findings also contribute to understanding the racial aspect of health disparities associated with COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality statistics. VDI is highly prevalent in dark-skinned persons: 82.1 percent of African Americans have Vitamin D insufficiency vs. 41.6 percent in the U.S. general population.

In a retrospective study12 of 212 COVID-19 patients in the Philippines published electronically on April 9, 2020, Vitamin D status was significantly associated with severity of COVID-19. In the analysis, 85.5 percent of patients with sufficient Vitamin D had mild cases while 72.8 percent of patients who were deficient in Vitamin D had severe or critical cases.

A retrospective cohort study13 of 780 cases with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia revealed that a majority of the death cases were older males with pre-existing conditions and Vitamin D insufficiency. Patients with Vitamin D insufficiency (between 20 and 30 ng/ml) were 12.55 times more likely to die and patients with severe Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) were 19.12 times more likely to die than those patients with sufficient levels of Vitamin D. After controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity, Vitamin D status is strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality. When compared to COVID-19 cases with normal Vitamin D status, death was approximately 10.12 times more likely for Vitamin D deficient cases.

Cytokine Storm and COVID-19 Mortality

On Apr. 30, 2020, researchers at Northwestern University pre-published a study14 of the role of Vitamin D in suppressing cytokine storm and associated mortality in COVID-19 patients. Researcher Ali Daneshkhah, PhD, said:

Cytokine storm can severely damage lungs and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients. This is what seems to kill a majority of COVID-19 patients, not the destruction of the lungs by the virus itself. It is the complications from the misdirected fire from the immune system.

Vadim Backman, PhD, and lead researcher on the study, says that not only does Vitamin D enhance our innate immune system, it also prevents our immune system from becoming dangerously overactive. This means that having healthy levels of vitamin D could protect patients against severe complications, including death, from COVID-19. “Our analysis shows that it might be as high as cutting the mortality rate in half,” Backman said. “It will not prevent a patient from contracting the virus, but it may reduce complications and prevent death in those who are infected.”15

Scientists continue to research coronavirus and Vitamin D levels

A research team from the University of Granada in Spain is conducting a ten-week trial of 200 COVID-19 patients.16 The study aims to investigate whether the use of vitamin D as an immune modulator agent induces significant improvements of health status and outcomes in non-severe symptomatic patients infected with COVID-19, as well as prevents COVID-19 health deterioration. The study is expected to end on June 30, 2020.

Many Americans are deficient in Vitamin D

Vitamin D deficiency is a major public health problem worldwide in all age groups, but Vitamin D status deteriorates with age due to decreased sun exposure and the body’s reduced ability to synthesize Vitamin D through the skin. Seventy-five percent of people institutionalized in medical facilities are severely vitamin D deficient.17

A 2018 study using measurements from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2001-2010 found that 28.9 percent of American adults were Vitamin D deficient (serum 25(OH)D<20ng/ml) and an additional 41.1 percent were Vitamin D insufficient (serum 25(OH)D between 20ng/ml and 30ng/ml). Adults who were obese, physically inactive, smokers, black, less educated, poor and infrequent consumers of milk had a higher prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency.18

Food sources of vitamin D

Very few foods contain Vitamin D, but fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, mackerel and fish liver oils, are among the best sources. Beef liver, cheese, egg yolks and some mushrooms also may contain small amounts of Vitamin D.19 In the U.S., some foods like milk are fortified with Vitamin D, and both the U.S. and Canada have mandated fortification of infant formula with Vitamin D.

“The problem is that people simply aren’t eating enough of these nutrients,” says Adrian Gombart, PhD of Oregon State University, and co-author of a study20 on nutrients and the immune system:

Vitamin C has roles in several aspects of immunity, including the growth and function of immune cells and antibody production. Vitamin D receptors on immune cells also affect their function. This means that vitamin D profoundly influences your response to infections.21

Safe sun exposure to maintain Vitamin D levels

Vitamin D from the sun is free, widely available, and the most natural way to get enough Vitamin D. There are two types of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. UVA is equally present from dawn to dusk in both summer and winter, whereas UVB radiation, which is the only form of sunlight that produces Vitamin D, varies in strength depending on the height of the sun and are most intense at noon. It is thought that exposure of a third of the skin to mid-day sunlight for 10-30 minutes three times a week in the summer is sufficient for most people.22

Michael Holick, MD, professor at Boston University School of Medicine , who is the author of The Vitamin D Solution and The UV Advantage, advocates for safe sun exposure as a way to maintain good vitamin D levels. He explains that, “Exposure to early morning and late afternoon sunlight does not provide any vitamin D but does expose us to UVA radiation which can alter the immune system and increase risk for skin cancer.”23 UVB rays cannot penetrate through glass, so people who work next to sunny windows are still prone to Vitamin D deficiency.24

High Doses of Vitamin C Used to Prevent and Treat Coronavirus...,"As reported by Orthomolecular Medicine News Service on Mar. 3, 2020, the government of Shanghai in China announced that it is recommending that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C, with dosage recommendations varying from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of body weight to up to 200 mg per kg per day.1 2

“These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV,” said Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, who is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy in Tokyo, Japan. “This specific method of administration is important because vitamin C’s effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally.”1 2

The official backing for vitamin C therapy for COVID-19 by the Shanghai government follows several small independent studies and at least three clinical trials reporting successful treatment of coronavirus patients with vitamin C,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 including one at Xi’an Jiaotong University Second Hospital. According to a statement released by the hospital:

On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past eight patients have been discharged from hospital… [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission… [E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).”1 2

The associate director for the clinical trials, Richard Cheng, MD, PhD of the United States, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities in China to encourage Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy—through both high oral doses and by IV.1 2

Dr. Cheng said, “Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2,000 people have died of the COIV-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.”2

The use of vitamin C is also supported by the Shanghai Medical Association (SMA). Based on a clinical study involving more than 300 patients, the SMA is recommending high doses of vitamin C even for light infections of coronavirus. The SMA’s ‘Shanghai Plan’ calls for 50 to 100 mg per kg of bodyweight per day to as much as 200 mg per kg via IV for critically ill patients.8

“We need to broadcast a message worldwide very quickly,” urged Dr. Cheng. “Vitamin C (small or large dose) does no harm to people and is the one of the few, if not the only, agent that has a chance to prevent us from getting, and can treat, COVID-19 infection”2

The Debate Over ADHD and Doctor Prescribed Video Games,"Story Highlights There is a long-standing debate over the value versus dangers of electronic stimulation of the brain in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Now, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first prescription-based video game, or “game based digital therapeutic device” for use in children with primary attention or combination type ADHD.

Pre-release studies have shown small but statistically significant improvements in objective measures of attention in children with ADHD using the specially designed video game, though many experts caution that the new therapy should be seen as a potential additional tool and not a replacement for current standards of treatment.

Video Games Allow ADHD Children to “Self-Medicate”

A small survey undertaken in China indicated that children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may experience particular challenges with pandemic-inspired lockdowns and school closings, but many seemed to do better with increased time in online study.1

The ability of children with ADHD—who typically have difficulty maintaining attention and concentration2—to focus on interactive electronic or on-line stimulation is a common observation. Answering the frequently asked question, “Why can my inattentive child pay attention to video games?” for Psychology Today, Dr. Victoria Dunckley explained that the rapid movement, intense colors, quick scene changes, and psychologically exciting content of video games provide enough stimulation to induce a dopamine surge, a “brain chemical involved in focus and reward pathways,” essentially allowing for “self-medication” by the child.3

Dr. Dunkley warned, however, that while video games may improve visual attention, they tend to worsen the ability to sustain focus and complete goal-oriented tasks, especially if the child may perceive tasks as boring or difficult.

Experts Disagree on Electronic Stimulation of Children’s Brains

Research since that 2014 article has been directed toward finding ways to use the ability of kids to stay tuned in to video input in a way that helps bolster their capacity for learning and staying focused on more mundane tasks. Numerous devices and games are now available to do just that.

According to Rohn Kessler, a Florida doctor who works with children with ADHD:

The games have the potential to increase attention stamina. They aren’t a quick fix or a one-step solution, but I have seen distracted kids increase their ability to focus.4

Some psychologists point to the potential value of neurofeedback in treating ADHD symptoms and suggest that video games may have a similar effect.5 Others believe electronic stimulation may increase the risk for and symptoms of ADHD.6

EndeavorRX Video Game Therapy Targets Children with ADHD

On June 15, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first prescription video game therapy, described as a “game based digital therapeutic device,” for the treatment of children with ADHD.7 Dubbed “EndeavorRXTM (previously AKL-T01),” the gaming program has been tested in more than 600 children and has reportedly generated a statistically significant one point improvement in scores on a Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA).8

EndeavorRX was designed specifically to treat children with primary attentive or combination ADHD, not for those with primary hyperactivity-type ADHD.9

Eddie Martucci, PhD, chief executive officer of Akili Interactive, the company behind EndeavorRX, commented on the recent FDA approval:

With EndeavorRx, we’re using technology to help treat a condition in an entirely new way as we directly target neurological function through medicine that feels like entertainment. Families are looking for new ways to help their children with ADHD. With today’s decision by FDA, we’re excited to offer families a first-of-its-kind non-drug treatment option and take an important first step toward our goal to help all people living with cognitive issues.10

According to Akilli, its EndeavorRx is based on a proprietary Selective Stimulus Management engine (SSMETM), which was designed to activate specific neural systems in the brain involved in attention function, along with adaptive algorithms that allow for personalization of the treatment experience. It was adapted from an earlier program called “Neuroracer,” designed by Akilli Interactive co-founder Adam Gazzaley, MD, PhD, to improve attention in older adults.11

EndeavorRX Studies on Children with ADHD

The FDA based its approval of the new digital therapy on results of five studies, three that focused on children with ADHD and two that were preliminary studies in children with ADHD and either sensory processing disorder or autism spectrum disorder.

One of the most influential studies, the “Software Treatment for Actively Reducing Severity of ADHD (STARS-ADHD),” which was reviewed in The Lancet Digital Health, was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled study of children between ages 8 and12 with confirmed ADHD. The children enrolled in the study were not taking ADHD medications (medications had to be stopped a minimum of three days before baseline) and they had to have TOVA Attention Performance Index (API) scores of −1.8 or below (TOVA is an FDA-approved, computerized, continuous performance test designed to measure attention and inhibitory control, normalized by age and gender).

Twenty research institutions in the U.S. took part in the STARS-ADHD study.12

Between July 15, 2016, and Nov 30, 2017, 857 children with ADHD were evaluated for the study. Ultimately, 348 were randomly assigned to treatment with either AKL-T01 (now called EndeavorRX) (N=180) or to the digital control group (N=168). The study required that participants use either EndeavorRX or the control program for four weeks, five days per week, with five daily sessions totaling approximately 25 minutes/day. The program was carried out at home.

Results showed that the treatment group achieved a 1.4 points or better improvement in TOVA API scores compared to controls (79, or 47 percent, versus 51, or 32 per cent). The researchers reported that more children in the EndeavorRX group moved into normal ranges in at least one objective measure of attention: 36 percent versus 21per cent, respectively. The improvements in attention as reported by the children themselves were not significantly different between the two groups, but improvements in attention were reported by parents: 97 (56 percent) of 173 in the treatment group reported seeing significant improvements compared to 71 (44 percent) of 162 in the control group.

Some Side Effects Reported in STARS-ADHD Study

Although 9.3 percent of participants experienced minor side effects including frustration, headache, dizziness, emotional reaction, nausea or aggression, no serious adverse reactions were reported in any prerelease trial.

The review by The Lancet Digital Health concluded that EndeavorRX might provide a useful addition to treatment options for ADHD, and, since the therapy is digital and can be done at home, populations without access to other forms of non-pharmacological interventions might find it particularly useful. The Lancet reviewers noted that results do not yet indicate that the treatment should be offered as an alternative to existing therapies. Akili stated that EndeavorRX “should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include: clinician-directed therapy, medication, and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder.”13

Criticism of Study Design, Caution Urged

Dr. David Rettew is skeptical about the program and its supporting studies, saying that certain flaws in the study design could affect interpretation of results. He pointed out that there were no significant improvements in global assessments of ADHD, which suggested “a limitation that has plagued other supposedly therapeutic games designed to boost cognition, which is that it can be hard to demonstrate that people get better at much more than the game itself.” He further noted that the study did not enroll any subjects with ADHD who “didn’t do sufficiently poorly on a computerized attention measure before being given a computerized treatment.”14

There are others who maintain that the FDA’s approval is premature. Dr. Joseph F. Hagan, Jr. of the American Academy of Pediatrics said more and larger studies are needed to justify recommending video games as a therapy for ADHD, as there is “still uncertainty about the long term effects of video game usage on children with ADHD.”15

Most experts agree that targeted video games and other digital programs should not be considered a stand-alone treatment for ADHD. “Medication and behavior therapy are still the gold standards for improving symptoms of the condition.”16

EndeavorRX is currently a prescription-only service that includes the program itself, a mobile tracking app and personal support services for caregivers. The base program is currently available without a prescription during the COVID-19 pandemic, but Akila states that it is, “committed to a seamless transition for them to the prescription program as appropriate.”17

Mental Health Impact from COVID-19 May Last Years,"Story Highlights A poll shows that the fear and anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of almost 50 percent of Americans.

Mental health experts have observed that anxiety stemming from the pandemic has come in waves beginning with anxiety about getting the infection or giving it to someone else to domestic/substance abuse to job loss/financial difficulties.

Experts are warning that post-traumatic stress disorder from events related to the pandemic can last for years.

After three months of a national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, experts warn that the United States will continue to experience a mental health crisis with escalating rates of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide.1

Pandemic Affecting Nearly Half of All Americans

According to a poll conducted by Kaiser Family Foundation conducted between Mar. 25 and Mar. 30, 2020, 45 percent of adults said that the pandemic has affected their mental health and 19 percent said it has had a “major impact” on their mental health. The rates were slightly higher for women, African-Americans, Hispanics and parents of children under the age of 18.2

Kathy Hoganbrugen, PhD, founder of the District Anxiety Center in Washington, DC states: “It’s not surprising given all the other huge numbers surrounding the pandemic in terms of joblessness and social distancing, which can equal social isolation. And people dying. People getting sick. All of these big numbers are going to have an outsized impact on our mental health collectively.”3

The Disaster Distress Helpline, a federal emergency hotline operated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), for people in emotional distress registered a more than a 1,000 percent increase in in April 2020 compared with the same time period last year. In March 2020, approximately 20,000 people texted that hotline.4

Increasing Cases of Fear and Anxiety

After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on Mar. 11, 2020 and U.S. health officials warned that states must institute home quarantine and social distancing restrictions or there would be nearly two million deaths in the U.S., the fear of being infected or infecting others with the new coronavirus became widespread.5 Crisis Text Line, a free mental health hotline that works in the United States, Canada, UK, and Ireland saw a traffic increase of up to 116 percent in late March and early April when these countries started imposing lockdown measures.6

Typically, the biggest issue that Crisis Text Line usually encounters is people suffering from depression; however, when the COVID-19 pandemic began, anxiety became the most prominent concern.7

During the beginning of the pandemic, people were worried about getting the infection themselves with the words “cough” and “asthma” being very common in the text messages.8 Three in five people in America reported that they feared they would get the virus.9 During this time, many people were also concerned about their elderly relatives getting sick since those over age 65 are at greater risk for complications from COVID-19, especially if they have one or more chronic poor health conditions like diabetes, obesity, hypertension or heart of lung disease.10

Several weeks after the national lockdown, the concerns that people were texting about shifted to problems involving quarantine and isolation, issues such as domestic abuse, sexual abuse and substance abuse.11

The current major concern that Crisis Text Line is now seeing is around issues of job loss, financial problems and grief.12 The United States has lost 20.6 million jobs since mid-March 2020.13

PTSD from COVID-19

Although people associate post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with an event such as war, PTSD is a chronic psychiatric disorder that can occur in people who have experienced or witnessed any type of traumatic event.14

During the SARS outbreak in 2003, health care workers and people who were quarantined experienced symptoms of PTSD. Experts are now warning that the COVID-19 pandemic could have a similar effect on people.15

Health care workers in frontline services as well as people who have lost loved ones or jobs due to the disease may be at greater risk for long-term mental health impacts. Those who struggle with other mental health conditions or who have a prior history of trauma are also at an increased risk of more ongoing distress.16

Jaimie Gradus, MPH, an associate professor at Boston University School of Public Health said:

As all this rolls on, the likelihood of compounded mental health consequences is increasing, with social factors really dovetailing into the psychiatric ones… In addition, there may be people throughout the country who missed this first initial wave of job layoffs but who may lose their job a month or two from now. There are people losing their housing and facing enormous health care bills. These consequences of the pandemic—which can all be forms of stress or trauma on a mass scale—will be ongoing and potentially worsening in the coming months. And all [of them] could lead to an increase in psychiatric distress or substance use.17

Mental Health Challenges for Patients

Patients who have recovered from serious cases of COVID-19 may also face long term mental health problems associated with the types of medical treatments and care they received. This is more likely for patients who were required to be admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and intubated. These patients may experience “post-intensive care syndrome” (PICS) that could lead to combination of physical, cognitive and mental health impairments after an ICU stay for a critical illness.18

COVID-19 has drastically changed ICU operations and taken away the factors that usually help patients feel safe and grounded, putting COVID-19 patients at a higher risk of PICS.19 Jessi Gold, MD at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri says, “The ways in which we were normally trying to avoid [PICS], we don’t have as much ability to do that [with COVID-19]. You don’t have family at the bedside, reorienting you or making you feel like you belong in some capacity.” She adds that, “You don’t have family getting you up and walking, which happens if you’re in the ICU and can move. You don’t have a lot of staff coming in and checking on you as much—there’s a lot less in and out movements of people. And yet there’s more codes and beeping and noise and worry and stress—[the patient] might not understand what’s going on.”20

Experts say that going back home from a long period of stay in the ICU can be overwhelming not only to the patient, but to the caregivers as well. Sapna Kudchadkar, MD, PhD of Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland says, “It’s a happy time but can be a hard one as well. Acknowledging that is important, and providing resources [is] key.”21

Blood Type May Affect Vulnerability to COVID-19,"Story Highlights An international group of geneticists has compared DNA of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 infection with that of healthy volunteers and found six gene clusters that may provide insight into the wide range of responses to the virus.

Results showed that patients with Type A blood appeared to have a greater susceptibility for severe infection, while those with Type O blood may have some protection.

The study lent credibility to an earlier study out of China that showed the same possible effect for individuals with differing blood types, and scientists are calling for further study to clarify and confirm the potential impact of biodiversity on response to infection.

A number of characteristics have been associated with a greater chance of developing a more serious symptomatic infection with COVID-19, among them older age, male gender and co-morbidity with diabetes, heart and lung disease or other serious underlying conditions.1 Now, researchers have drawn a potential link to blood type, suggesting that having Type O blood may provide some protection, while those with Type A blood may face a worse outcome.2

A collaborative group of international researchers from Germany, Italy, Norway, and Spain set out to determine whether genetic factors might help explain why COVID-19 infections elicit such a dramatic variation in responses among different people, ranging from mild or asymptomatic infection to life-threatening, multi-organ failure and death. They recruited 1,980 hospitalized patients with varying degrees of respiratory failure and confirmed COVID-19 infection from hospitals in pandemic epicenters of Italy and Spain. An additional 2,381 control subjects included randomly selected blood donors, healthy volunteers and outpatients in Italy and healthy blood donors in Spain. Following quality control exclusions, the final genotyped cohort included 835 patients and 1,255 control participants from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control participants from Spain.3

Genome Analysis Searches for Answers to Variations in COVID-19 Severity

The data were analyzed in a “genome-wide association study,” which involves sorting the genetic map to see if there are DNA variations common to the sickest patients.4 Analysis of the data indicated that variations in six genetic locations might reflect both an individual’s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and the risk of developing a more severe case, although the authors stressed that further study is needed.

One of the genetic clusters identified contains the gene that controls for a person’s blood type, and the study analysis suggested that blood type might in fact play a role. In reporting the results of this study, the authors write, ”In the meta-analysis corrected for age and sex, we found a higher risk among persons with blood group A than among patients with other blood groups (odds ratio, 1.45; 95 percent CI, 1.20 to 1.75; P=1.48×10−4) and a protective effect for blood group O as compared with the other blood groups (odds ratio, 0.65; 95 percent CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P=1.06×10−5).”5

The locus that houses the gene for determination of blood type also contains DNA coding involved in triggering strong immune responses such as the cytokine storms associated with severe COVID-19 complications and death.6

Earlier Study Showed Similar Results About COVID-19 Links to Blood Type

This result appears to confirm an earlier report out of Shenzhen, China, that reached the same conclusion but was greeted with some skepticism at the time. That study compared the blood group distribution of 2,173 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to that of 3,694 individuals in the general population. Preliminary results revealed a significantly higher proportion of hospitalized patients had blood type A compared to the general population (38 percent vs 31 percent, respectively). Conversely, the proportion of hospitalized patients with blood Type O was significantly lower than was found in the general population (25 percent vs 34 percent).

The authors concluded, ““People with blood group A have a significantly higher risk for acquiring COVID-19, compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O has a significantly lower risk for the infection, compared with non-O blood groups.”7 Of note, the patient population in that study was limited to patients hospitalized with serious COVID-19 infection, so conclusions don’t reflect overall risk for infection.

Conceding that the results of the Chinese study were preliminary and had not been peer reviewed, Dr. William A. Petri, Jr. of the University of Virginia said, “It is biologically plausible that different blood groups might vary in their susceptibility to COVID-19.” Explaining how that could be, he said it has to do with the way proteins on the surface of the virus bind to the different sugars on surface cells, and those sugars are different for different blood types.

People with Type A blood have an extra sugar on the surface of the cells that is not present in Type O blood.

Blood Type Has Been Associated with Infectious Disease Susceptibility in Earlier Studies

The idea that blood type could have an impact on susceptibility or severity of an infectious disease is not without precedent. According to Dr. David Valle, director of the Institute of Genetic Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, blood type has been associated with susceptibility to other infectious diseases such as cholera, recurrent urinary tract infections from E. coli, and H. pylori, which can cause ulcers and stomach cancers.8 The phenomenon also has been observed in response to such infections as Norwalk virus, hepatitis B and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).9

Blood type is determined by the antibody-producing antigens residing on the surface of the blood cells. In the case of SARS, it has been suggested that anti-A antibodies (found in the plasma of Type O but not in Type A blood10) may inhibit the virus, a mechanism that theoretically could be important in SARS-CoV-2 as well.11

Diversity and Influence of Human Blood Types is a New Science

It has only been a just over 100 years since trial and error with blood transfusions began to give way to understanding that human blood is not all the same. The science of blood typing is still relatively young: the Rh factor was only identified in 1939.12

Given the relatively small size of the study and other possible explanations for the results, researchers say it is still too soon to establish that blood type per se is directly responsible for differences in susceptibility. Their hope is that these type of studies provide more information about how biodiversity might affect different responses to infectious diseases and how to manage patient risk and design therapies to treat COVID-19.13

Misleading CDC Report on COVID-19 Testing Combines “Apples and...,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged last week that it had lumped genetic tests that identify people with current COVID-19 infections together with serology (blood) antibody tests that measure whether someone has had the viral infection in the past.1 Combining the tally of the two tests overstates the country’s ability to test people who are currently sick with COVID-19 and provides an inaccurate picture of the state of the pandemic.2

Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute said such errors render the CDC numbers about how many Americans are currently infected with COVID-19 as “uninterpretable,” creating a misleading picture for people trying to make decisions based on the data.

William Hanage, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health explained:3

It is incumbent on health departments and the CDC to make sure they’re presenting information that’s accurate. And if they can’t get it, then don’t show the data at all. Faulty data is much, much worse than no date. Combining a test that is designed to detect current infection with a test that detects infection at some point in the past is just really confusing and muddies the water.4

According to most public health professionals following the pandemic, viral test results that detect current or past COVID-19 infections should be reported separately. Making this distinction helps health officials understand how many people currently are actively infected, the percentage of people testing positive, and how those numbers change over time, which affects the setting of public health policy.5

The CDC obtains COVID-19 testing data from several sources, including state public health labs, commercial testing companies and hospitals.6 Several states are also blending data from the two tests in the same way, including Pennsylvania, Texas, Georgia and Vermont. Virginia and Maine also mixed their test results but changed their practice after several publications reported the inadvisability of mixing of the viral infection and antibody tests.7

Combining statistics for antibody testing with statistics for diagnostic testing of current infections could have the effect of reducing the number of tests that appear to be producing positive results, lowering the overall “positivity rate.” The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended an infection positivity rate of 10 percent or less as a signal of whether enough testing is taking place in a population. “I suspect [combining the two tests] will artificially lower the percent positive,” says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.8 The White House’s guidelines say that for a state to reopen it must observe a downward trajectory in its number of daily cases or its percentage of positive cases.9

Adequate testing for current infections has been cited repeatedly as a key to safely reopening the economy, so the lack of clarity around how tests are counted raises questions about the true percentage of people with active infections. The American Medical Association said recently that antibody tests should only be used for research and deciding which patients can donate plasma, and not as a determination of natural herd immunity or a reason to lessen social distancing.10

COVID-19 testing capacity to determine the numbers of current infections in the U.S. has more than doubled over the past month, increasing from about 147,000 tests a day in mid-April to more than 413,000 tests a day as of May 20. Simultaneously, the proportion of positive tests recorded each week fell from 10 percent to six percent of total tests conducted. Both trends appear encouraging at face value, but given that results of tests for current infections and antibody tests for past infections are sometimes being lumped together, it’s impossible to know whether the data accurately reflects the reality of how many people in America are currently infected with COVID-19 or have recovered from past infections and have antibodies that give them protection.11

Will Coronavirus Mutations Delay COVID-19 Vaccines?,"Story Highlights

Seven different coronaviruses have been shown to cause disease in human beings, including common ones that tend to cause transient respiratory infections often referred to as the “common cold,” and others that cause more serious illnesses such as SERS, MERS and the current COVID-19.

The virus that causes COVID-19 has been believed to be relatively stable with a low mutation rate, leading vaccine manufacturers to believe a long-lasting vaccine could be created quickly.

New research has shown a significant mutation with different immune characteristics has already occurred on a genome sequence sample from January 27th, suggesting that if mutations can occur at any time, creating a vaccine may not be simple or even feasible.

One of the issues vaccine manufacturers have with creating a vaccine against coronaviruses is that, like influenza viruses, they contain single strands of RNA. This viral type has a tendency to mutate, making it a challenge to create a vaccine that might remain relevant on an ongoing basis.1

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seven coronaviruses have been identified as capable of causing human disease. The four most common are 229E, NL63, OC43 or HKU1, which generally cause mild and passing respiratory symptoms often referred to as the “common cold.”2 Others are MERS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and, now, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has caused the current pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).3

Genomic Stability Informs Vaccine Development

SARS-CoV-2 had been considered to be a relatively stable coronavirus with a low rate of mutation, persuading some scientists that an effective vaccine could be found quickly. Professor Stefano Menzo, a virologist at Ancona University Hospital observed in March 2020 that, “Our initial data show that this is a very stable RNA virus, with only five novel variants,” adding that, ”A virus with a stable genome is good news for vaccine development because it indicates that the effectiveness of vaccines could be more consistent, possibly over many years.”4

A ‘Significant’ COVID-19 Mutation Identified

Nevertheless, several mutations have already been reported. By mid-April, researchers from the University of Cambridge mapping how the virus has spread from the epicenter in Wuhan, China, stated the virus has mutated into three distinct strains. The first is “Strain A,” thought to be the original strain found in Wuhan; the second is “Strain B,” two mutations from A and responsible for most of the cases in Wuhan and East Asia; and the third is “Strain C,” offshoot of B and the strain responsible for most of the infections in Europe.5

In April, researchers in Australia and Taiwan also published an article analyzing the mutation dynamics of SARS CoV-2 and found a mutant, stating, “This represents the first report of a significant SARS-CoV-2 mutant and raises the alarm that the ongoing vaccine development may become futile in future epidemic if more mutations were identified.”6 7

For this study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, 106 complete or nearly complete genome sequences were obtained from NCBI databanks. The study material included 54 nucleotide sequences from the U.S., 35 from China, 3 from Spain, 1 from Australia, 2 each from Brazil and India, and 1 each from Finland, Italy, Nepal, South Korea and Sweden. In almost all cases, the samples were highly homogeneous, sharing over 99 percent of their identity. But on one of the samples from India, collected on January 27, the researchers identified a mutation that they believe would result in a weaker “receptor binding affinity” for human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2).

ACE2 Provides the Gateway to COVID-19

A protein receptor primarily found on the surface of cells in the veins, kidneys and testes, but also—importantly for COVID-19—found in the lungs, kidneys and intestines,8 ACE2 is believed to provide the entryway that allows the spiky proteins on the SARS-CoV-2 virus to connect to, enter, and infect the cells of the body.9 Those spiky proteins on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, specifically an area on the spikes known as the receptor-binding domain, or RBD, where the mutation was found, attach to protein receptors on the ACE2. These spikes represent a primary research targets for developing vaccines, therapies and diagnostics for COVID-19,10 11 so mutations that affect their ability to infect the cell may have important repercussions for investigations into COVID-19.

Mutation Dynamics of COVID-19 Need Monitoring

Agreeing that SARS-CoV-2 has a much lower mutation rate than SARS, for example, the researchers warned:

Whilst it is generally safe to say that SARS-CoV-2 tends to mutate at a low rate, all current analyses are merely based on data collected at the early stage of this pandemic. As the virus continues to spread rapidly around the world, and more genomic data is accumulated, the evolution and mutation dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 still need to be monitored closely… the observation in this study raised the alarm that SARS- CoV-2 mutation with varied epitope profile could arise at any time, which means current vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 is at great risk of becoming futile.12

Study Estimates CA COVID-19 Mortality Rate Under One Percent,"The University of Southern California (USC) and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health released preliminary results on Apr. 20, 2020 from a collaborative study that suggests infections from the coronavirus in Los Angeles County are more widespread, and the fatality rate much lower, than previously assumed. Based on antibody testing results from 863 adults, the research team estimated that approximately 4.1 percent of the county’s adult population has been infected and has antibody to the virus. This infection rate is 28 to 55 times higher than the 7,994 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported to the county at the time of the study in early April, and translates into approximately 221,000 to 442,000 adults in the county who have been infected.1

The study tested for antibodies, which is useful for identifying past infection. Participants were recruited using a proprietary database that is representative of the county’s population, and were tested at six drive-thru testing sites on Apr. 10 and 11, 2020. The researchers intend to repeat the study every two to three weeks for several months, in order to track the trajectory of the virus’ spread. Results of the study are preliminary and have not yet been peer-reviewed by other scientists.

Lead researcher Neeraj Sood, PhD, professor of public policy at the USC Price School for Public Policy and senior fellow at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, stated, “We haven’t known the true extent of COVID-19 infections in our community because we have only tested people with symptoms, and the availability of tests has been limited. The estimates also suggest that we might have to recalibrate disease prediction models and rethink public health strategies.”

“These results indicate that many persons may have been unknowingly infected and at risk of transmitting the virus to others,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.

Paul Simon, chief science officer at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and co-lead on the study cautioned, “Though the results indicate a lower risk of death among those with infection than was previously thought, the number of COVID-related deaths each day continues to mount, highlighting the need for continued vigorous prevention and control efforts.”

The results of the USC study came three days after researchers at Stanford University reported that the coronavirus appears to have circulated much more widely in Santa Clara County, California, than previously thought. The findings bolster the sense that a significant portion of those carrying the virus could show no symptoms at all. Deborah Birx, MD, the coordinator of President Trump’s coronavirus task force, said during a White House briefing that the USC results underscore “concern about asymptomatic spread” because it is harder to trace.2 The two antibody prevalence studies are the largest conducted in the U.S. to date.

Using antibody tests to determine infection incidence provides a more accurate picture of how many of those infected have complications resulting in death. The mortality rate is based on the number of confirmed infections and confirmed deaths; the higher the number of infections, the lower the fatality rate. Both the USC and the Stanford University studies estimated a mortality rate of 0.1 to 0.2 percent, which is closer to the death rate associated with the seasonal influenza.

Most experts agree there are far more coronavirus infections in the world than are being counted. But as soon as the numbers from both studies were released, the researchers were criticized for how they arrived at those numbers. Chief among their concerns was the accuracy of the test underpinning both studies, and whether the scientists had fully accounted for the number of false positives it might generate. Marm Kilpatrick, PhD, an infectious disease researcher at the University of California at Santa Cruz worries that the results of these two studies could erode public trust in the need for lockdowns. “If that’s based on faulty information, that would be terrible,” he said.

One of the biggest criticisms is that the researchers were overly confident in the antibody test’s false-positive rate and failed to account for the likely possibility that it could be lower or higher—a potential difference that would dramatically affect the studies’ conclusions. Both studies used tests from Premier Biotech, and accuracy claims were independently verified at Stanford University. The researchers assumed a false positive rate of 0.5 percent, but acknowledged it could range between 0.1 and 1.7 percent. Researchers adjusted for this range while calculating their infection estimates, but given the small number of samples used to validate the test, coupled with the fact that the test is almost as new as the virus, critics say it’s possible that the true false-positive rates could be even higher than presented. The test can also generate false negatives estimated to be in the range of 20 to 28 percent.3

Dr. Sood, who is a member of both the USC and the Stanford research teams, said that he and the Stanford team had done their best to adjust for the test’s false positives and false negatives, while acknowledging that they were taking a second look at their confidence intervals. “As new data comes in about these tests, we will update these results,” he said.

Unprecedented Response to COVID-19 by Governments Prohibits Physical Contact and Cripples World Economy,"After officials at the World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Mar. 11, 2020 that outbreaks of a mutated coronavirus (COVID-19)1 2 had become a global pandemic and urged countries to take strong action to stop its spread,3 4 the governments of countries representing one-third of the world’s population5 closed borders, restricted or halted travel between and within countries and ordered healthy people to essentially eliminate physical contact with each other by staying in their homes. The halt to travel and closure of schools, businesses, stores and shopping centers, restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, gyms, beaches, parks and recreation areas, churches, and other places, where children are educated and people conduct business, shop and engage in recreation, sent stock markets into a sudden nosedive6 and has crippled the world’s economy.7

Testing Not Widespread Yet to Detect Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Cases

The outbreak of a new mutated coronavirus in China was publicly announced on Dec. 31, 2019,8 and by Mar. 27, 2020, over 565,000 people in 199 countries reportedly had been infected with over 25,000 confirmed deaths.9

The true number of cases that have already occurred are thought to be vastly underestimated because an unknown number of people are being asymptomatically infected or showing only mild symptoms,10 11 12 which can be mistaken for a cold or a respiratory influenza-like-illness,13 and testing for COVID-19 active infection or antibodies demonstrating past infection and natural immunity has not yet become widespread in most countries.14 15

In the U.S., since Jan. 21, 2020 more than 90,000 cases and 1,300 deaths had been confirmed spanning all 50 states.16 By Mar. 27, New York had reported the highest numbers of cases (38,987) and deaths (432) to date, with New Jersey, California, Washington, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts and Louisiana reporting between 2,000 and 7,000 cases each and a total of 539 deaths.17

Current Mortality Estimates Vary Among Countries

According to Worldometer,18 which is owned by Dadax and composed of an international team of developers, researchers and volunteers with no political, government or corporate affiliation analyzing and making world statistics available to the public, there is a large variation in mortality estimates associated with COVID-19 at the present time. For example, as of Mar. 27, China appears to have 2 deaths per million people, while Germany and the U.S. currently are experiencing 4 deaths per million, but Italy has 151 deaths per million and Spain has 106 deaths per million.

For all currently reported global cases and deaths, it appears there is an average of 3.4 deaths per million people.19 However, with more widespread testing for and reporting of active and past infections, along with deaths, these preliminary COVID-19 mortality statistics for different countries could change.20

COVID-19 Complications Higher in Seniors and Chronically Ill

By mid-February, there was information coming out of China that some people were at higher risk for complications from COVID-19 infections than others, even though the majority of people have mild symptoms and recover without treatment.21 The World Health Organization (WHO) states that:22

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

Evidence published in the medical literature by early March 2020 characterizing the type of COVID-19 disease symptoms and high risk factors among the population in China revealed that common major symptoms (22-88 percent) included fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, expectoration and difficulty breathing. Minor symptoms (less than 12 percent) included headache or dizziness, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, with those aged 60 years or older at higher risk.23 Another study published by Chinese scientists found that underlying cardiovascular disease, secondary infections, older age and elevated inflammatory indicators in the blood suggested that COVID-19 mortality might be due to “virus-activated ‘cytokine storm syndrome” or fulminant myocarditis.”24

As of Mar. 27, 2020, the CDC currently lists the following high risk factors for severe illness from a COVID-19 infection:25

People aged 65 years and older

People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility

Other high-risk conditions could include: People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma People who have heart disease with complications People who are immunocompromised including cancer treatment People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [(BM]I)≥40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver disease might also be at risk

People who are pregnant should be monitored since they are known to be at risk with severe viral illness, however, to date data on COVID-19 has not shown increased risk

The CDC also says that the following symptoms are found in patients who have been tested and confirmed to be infected with COVID-19:26

Frequently reported signs and symptoms of patients admitted to the hospital include fever (77–98%), cough (46%–82%), myalgia or fatigue (11–52%), and shortness of breath (3-31%) at illness onset. Among 1,099 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, fever was present in 44% at hospital admission, and developed in 89% during hospitalization. Other less commonly reported respiratory symptoms include sore throat, headache, cough with sputum production and/or hemoptysis [coughing up blood or bloody mucus]. Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms.

According to the CDC, “Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.”27

Americans Start Buying Masks and Hand Sanitizer to Protect Themselves

By the end of February, the World Health Organization (WHO) had not yet declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic,28 but there had been daily reports in the media warning that COVID-19 was taking a foothold in the U.S.29 and many concerned Americans had begun to make preparations to protect themselves by buying masks, hand sanitizer and stocking food and household supplies. On Mar. 1, the U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams sent out a message on Twitter:30

Seriously people – STOP BUYING MASKS. They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching coronavirus but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk! The best way to protect yourself and your community is with everyday preventive actions, like staying home when you are sick and washing hands with soap and water, to help slow the spread of respiratory illness. Get your flu shot – fewer flu patients = more resources for COVID-19.

CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield agreed. He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that, “There is no role for these masks in the community. These masks need to be prioritized for health care professionals that as part of their job are taking care of individuals.”31

CDC Predicted Up To 1.7 Million COVID-19 Deaths in the U.S.

Two days after the WHO declared a COVID-19 pandemic, The New York Times published a widely-quoted article on Mar. 13 entitled “The worst-case estimate for U.S. coronavirus deaths” that raised even more concern in the public about the potential lethality of COVID-19.32 In the article, it was revealed that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had been conferring with epidemiologists at universities around the world and were modeling pandemic COVID-19 scenarios based on what was known about the transmissibility and severity of the new mutated coronavirus to come up with “worst case” estimates if no actions were taken to slow transmission.

According to The New York Times:

Between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to one projection. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die. The calculations based on the CDC’s scenarios suggested 2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds. Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill.

An epidemic modeler at Johns Hopkins, Lauren Gardner, was quoted as saying, “There is a lot of room for improvement if we act appropriately,” and urged people to “change their behavior” to alter the course of the pandemic said “changing behavior” would alter the course of the pandemic. A University of Nebraska infectious disease specialist, Dr. James Lawler, was quoted as estimating there would be 96 million Americans infected and 450,000 deaths.

The New York Times article also pointed out that, “about 20,000 to 50,000 people have died from flu-related illnesses this season, according to the CDC.”

WHO Urges Testing But U.S. Couldn’t Do It For Months – Fauci Tells Americans to “Hunker Down”

Several days later on Mar. 16, WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus criticized nations for not doing enough to test for and contain spread of COVID-19. He said:33

We have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response… We have a simple message for all countries: Test, test, test. Test every suspected case. If they test positive, isolate them and find out who they have been in contact with two days before they developed symptoms and test those people, too.

A week later Dr. Ghebreyesus said, “Asking people to stay at home and other physical distancing measures are an important way to slow down the spread of the virus and buy time, but they are defensive measures that won’t help us to win.”34 He once again emphasized widespread testing for COVID-19. “All countries should be able to test all suspected cases. They cannot fight this pandemic blindfolded; they should know where the cases are.”

However, by the time COVID-19 was first reported in the U.S. on Jan. 21, 2020 until just recently, little testing for presence of the virus in the U.S. population was done.35 Instead, former and current federal health officials have put primary emphasis on shutting down education, commerce, business and recreation to try to stop spread of the virus.

Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Mar. 8 that, “No city wants to be the first to basically shut down their economy, state and cities are going to have to act in the interest of the national interest,”36 and urged the federal government to provide economic incentives to cities and states that will suffer hardship from shutting down their economies.

On Mar. 12 at a congressional hearing, Director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Dr. Anthony Fauci admitted that the U.S. was unable to meet the required capacity for coronavirus testing of everyone in the U.S. who needs it. “The system is not really geared to what we need right now,” he said. “That is a failing. Let’s admit it.”37

A few days later, Dr. Fauci advocated for taking aggressive quarantine and “social distancing” measures in the U.S. similar to those first taken by the Chinese and, later, the Italian government to “lockdown” populations in an effort to stop spread of COVID-19. On Mar. 15, Dr. Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press:38

I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing… I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting.

Persistent COVID-19 Testing Problems in the U.S.

On Mar. 22, 2020, the FDA approved a 45-minute lab test to confirm COVID-19 infections.39 The approval came after a series of investigative reports had been published by Science Magazine, Pro-Publica, and Axios that the U.S. had been suffering from continuing problems with providing COVID-19 testing kits to hospitals in the states after the COVID-19 outbreak was identified in the U.S. in January 2020.

On Feb. 28, Science Magazine reported the CDC had only performed 459 tests for the virus in patients suspected to be infected:40

The World Health Organization (WHO) has shipped testing kits to 57 countries. China had five commercial tests on the market 1 month ago and can now do up to 1.6 million tests a week; South Korea has tested 65,000 people so far. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent. Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases—and test them faster—have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests. In what is already an infamous snafu, CDC initially refused a request to test a patient in Northern California who turned out to be the first probable COVID-19 case without known links to an infected person. The problems have led many to doubt that the official tally of 60 confirmed cases in the United States is accurate.

Also on Feb. 28 Pro-Publica reported:41

As the highly infectious coronavirus jumped from China to country after country in January and February, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lost valuable weeks that could have been used to track its possible spread in the United States because it insisted upon devising its own test. The federal agency shunned the World Health Organization test guidelines used by other countries and set out to create a more complicated test of its own that could identify a range of similar viruses. But when it was sent to labs across the country in the first week of February, it didn’t work as expected.

On Mar. 1, Axios said that the Trump administration had ordered an independent investigation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab in Atlanta responsible for manufacturing COVID-19 test kits for labs around the country after reports of potential contamination of the test kits. Axios stated that, “The U.S. government had admitted to problems with its diagnostic tests—which have put the U.S. well behind China and South Korea in doing large-scale testing of the American public for the coronavirus.”42

According to the Mar. 27 report by USA Today:43

From its biggest cities to its smallest towns, America’s chance to contain the coronavirus crisis came and went in the seven weeks since U.S. health officials botched the testing rollout and then misled scientists in state laboratories about this critical early failure. Federal regulators failed to recognize the spiraling disaster and were slow to relax the rules that prevented labs and major hospitals from advancing a backup…the nation’s public health pillars—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration—shirked their responsibility to protect Americans in an emergency like this new coronavirus, USA TODAY found in interviews with dozens of scientists, public health experts and community leaders, as well as email communications between laboratories and hospitals across the country. The result was a cascading series of failures now costing lives.

Federal Agencies Fail to Stockpile Adequate Pandemic Supplies

Federal agencies responsible for pandemic planning, notably the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)44 45 46 and Department of Homeland Security (DHS),47 which are given billions of dollars in congressional appropriations every year,48 49 appear to have been unprepared to respond quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic not only by failing to supply testing kits but because they had not stockpiled enough masks, gowns and gloves needed for health care workers and ventilators needed for patients.50

Healthcare workers at hospitals are reporting they do not feel safe treating patients with COVID-19 when they do not have appropriate protective equipment that protects both them and their patients. In a Mar. 26 International Business Times article, a nurse working for Kaiser Permanente was quoted as saying, “They’re putting us in danger. They’re putting our families in danger, and they’re putting our co-workers in danger.”51

In a report by NBC surveying more than 250 health care workers in the U.S., the network reported that:52

A hospital nurse in Michigan says she and her colleagues have discussed bringing in bleach to make their own disinfectant wipes. A pregnant nurse in Ohio says she has no choice but to tend to critically ill patients without a specialized N95 mask. And a health care worker in Georgia has resorted to scouring local hardware stores in an effort to secure the protective masks… Nearly all who responded said there were shortages of PPE [personal protective equipment] in the hospitals, outpatient clinics and offices where they worked. Many reported being forced to ration or reuse supplies, including surgical and N95 masks, for fear of running out. Many also said they were facing shortages of basic sanitary supplies, including hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.

Americans Endure Financial Hardship, Loss of Civil Liberties

With at least half the country in some kind of “lockdown” that requires Americans to lose their income and their freedom in order to comply with federal quarantine guidelines and state quarantine laws, following is a selection of media reports about what they are being told to endure during the COVID-19 public health emergency:

Jail Time for Quarantine Breakers. On Mar. 13, an Austin, Texas station reported that53 the Austin-Travis County Health Authority is taking legal action against those ordered to quarantine in their homes and anyone breaking quarantine could get up to 6 months in jail. If the Health Authority believes someone “is ill with, has been exposed to, or is the carrier of” COVID-19, the order also prohibits the person from having people over to their home “without the prior approval of Austin Public Health.” People under quarantine cannot “congregate in settings such as grocery stores, movie theaters, etc,” and must record their own temperatures and give that information to the Health Authority in phone calls conducted up to two times each day during quarantine, which usually lasts14 days.

Quarantine Shaming. On Mar. 19, Associated Press reported that many Americans were being subjected to criticism and shunning if they choose not to or cannot strictly conform with recently enacted “social distancing” rules:54

“Quarantine shaming”—calling out those not abiding by social distancing rules—is part of a new and startling reality for Americans who must navigate a world of rapidly evolving social norms in the age of COVID-19. As schools close and shelter-in-place orders sweep across the U.S., the divide between those who are stringently practicing self-isolation and those who are still trying to go about some semblance of a normal life has never been more clear. Complicating matters: What was socially acceptable even 48 hours ago may now be taboo, as government officials race to contain the virus with ever-expanding circles of social isolation.”

Scolding the Public. After cancelling the St. Patrick’s Day Parade, which has been held every year since 1772, on Sunday Mar. 22, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio scolded New York City residents for going to parks. According to Associated Press, Governor Cuomo said he was “exasperated” that people are ignoring his social distancing orders and are clustering in groups and acting like it was just another nice spring weekend.”55 Governor Cuomo was quoted as saying:

There is a density level in New York City that is wholly inappropriate. This is just a mistake! It is a mistake! It is insensitive. It is arrogant. It is self-destructive. It’s disrespectful to other people and it has to stop and it has to stop now. This is not a joke and I am not kidding.

You Are Your Safest Sex Partner. According to an article in Newsweek,56 the day before on Mar. 21, the New York City Health Department issued guidance for residents of New York City about how to have safe sex during the coronavirus outbreak. Advising residents to stay home and minimize contact with others, the fact sheet posted on the health department’s website stated “you are your safest sex partner” because it “will not spread COVID-19, especially if you wash your hands (and any sex toys) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after sex.” The Health Department also instructed people to “disinfect keyboards and touch screens that you share with others (for video chat, for watching pornography or for anything else).”57

Temperature Taking Before Entering Supermarkets? On Mar. 22, Dr. Anthony Fauci told Science Magazine that requiring Americans to have their temperatures taken before they enter a supermarket like was done in China is “something that should be considered.” He added, “I will bring it up at the next task force meeting and see whether there’s some sort of a logistical, bureaucratic reason why it can’t be done. The rationale for doing it is at least worth serious consideration.”58

Using Drones to Drive People Indoors. On Mar. 23, International Business Insider said that, “law enforcement in California is using drones to make sure that people do not flout quarantine measures amid a lockdown in the state.”59 After the Governor of California declared a state of emergency and told residents they had to stay in their homes and only leave to buy essential supplies and medicine, police in a city near San Diego (Chula Vista) purchased two $11,000 drones with speakers and night vision cameras “to drive people indoors” during the lockdown.

China was the first country to use drones to reprimand citizens who didn’t obey COVID-19 quarantine rules and then France and Spain began using drones to warn people to return to their homes.60 Some nations, like India, have taken harsher measures. The government has warned the population of over 1.3 billion people that anyone defying the coronavirus lockdown order could be shot.61

Banning Partners and Doulas at Births in Hospitals. On Mar. 24, The Hill reported that:62

Expectant mothers planning to give birth at two leading New York City hospital systems will not be able to have spouses, partners, midwives or doulas present, despite a mother’s birth plan. Hospital networks NewYork-Presbyterian and Mt. Sinai Health have limited their visitor policies to ban family members, spouses and birth coaches from delivery rooms in an effort to further reduce the spread of the coronavirus in medical settings.

124,000 US Public and Private Schools Closed. On Mar. 27, Education Week reported that “School closures due to coronavirus have impacted at least 124,000 U.S. public and private schools and affected at least 55.1 million students.” Schools are closed in all 50 states currently. In California, New Jersey and North Dakota, schools are closed until further notice. The states of Kansas, Virginia, Oklahoma, Alabama, Vermont, Nebraska and New Mexico have announced schools will not open again this school year.63

“Do Not Resuscitate” the Infected?

On Mar. 26, The Washington Post reported that hospitals are debating “how to weigh the ‘save at all costs’ approach to resuscitating a dying patient against the real danger of exposing doctors and nurses to the contagion of coronavirus.” The discussion is being driven by the nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment—such as masks, gowns and gloves—and questions being raised about whether it is worth the risk to hospital staff to “justify the conventional response when a patient ‘codes,’ and their heart or breathing stops.”

According to The Washington Post:64

Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago has been discussing a universal do-not-resuscitate policy for infected patients, regardless of the wishes of the patient or their family members—a wrenching decision to prioritise the lives of the many over the one… Officials at George Washington University Hospital in Washington say they have had similar conversations, but for now will continue to resuscitate Covid-19 patients using modified procedures, such as putting plastic sheeting over the patient to create a barrier. The University of Washington Medical Centre in Seattle, one of the country’s major hot spots for infections, is dealing with the problem by severely limiting the number of responders to a contagious patient in cardiac or respiratory arrest.

Earlier in March, The Atlantic reported that doctors in Italy had begun employing a utilitarian rationale to justify denying medical care to elderly COVID-19 infected patients or those with underlying conditions that raised their risk for death.65 The Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published guidelines for the criteria that doctors and nurses should follow, comparing “the moral choices Italian doctors may face to the forms of wartime triage and, rather than providing intensive care to all patients who need it, instead apply “distributive justice and the appropriate allocation of limited health resources.”

The approach that is being taken in Italy is based on utilitarianism, which uses a mathematical model as a guide to public policy that justifies sacrificing the few in order to maximize benefits for a greater number of people. When making intensive care decisions, the doctors would follow criteria that guarantees only patients with “the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care” and the rules would apply to all patients, not only those infected with coronavirus. They have discussed that “it may become necessary to establish an age limit for access to intensive care.”

Those who are too old to have a high likelihood of recovery, or who have too low a number of ‘life-years’ left even if they should survive, would be left to die.

Deliberately infect Vaccine Trial Participants with COVID-19?

In another unprecedented development regarding medical ethics, on Mar. 25, MIT Technology Review reported that, “A group of academics say that 100 altruistic young people should volunteer to get a vaccine for Covid-19 and then be infected with the coronavirus on purpose.”66 The academics admit that a “challenge trial” is controversial but argue it could speed up testing of a vaccine to prove it does or does not work.

According to MIT Technology Review:

No one, though, has yet had virus squirted up their nose on purpose, something that is ethically dubious under most circumstances. The drawback is obvious, the authors admit: “Challenging volunteers with this live virus risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death. It’s likely that if a challenge trial occurs, plenty of volunteers would sign up. After all, first responders, EMTs, health-care workers, and even grocery store clerks are already putting themselves at risk of Covid-19 by staying on the job. It may seem impermissible to ask people to take on risk of severe illness or death, even for an important collective gain,” the authors of the challenge proposal write. “But we actually ask people to take such risks for others’ direct gain every time we ask volunteer firefighters to rush into burning buildings.

COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients and Underlying Chronic Disease,"Story Highlights Recent research shows that most hospitalized COVID-19 patients had one or more chronic poor health conditions, such as obesity, hypertension and heart and lung disease.

Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, making the U.S. population susceptible to more severe COVID-19 infections.

Good nutrition helps reduce susceptibility to chronic illness, which in turn reduces susceptibility to complications from infectious diseases like COVID-19.

A report released this month by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on COVID-19 risk factors found that approximately 90 percent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had one or more underlying conditions, the most common being obesity, hypertension, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.1

Co-Morbidities in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients

Preliminary evidence indicates that obesity may be one of the most important risk factors and predictors of severe COVID-19 illness, particularly among younger patients.2 3 Newly published data reveals that among those under 60 years old, obesity was twice as likely to result in hospitalization for COVID-19 infections and also significantly increased the likelihood that a patient would need intensive care.3 4

CDC data also suggests that, although people suffering from any type of diabetes may not necessarily be at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection, if they do, the odds are higher for having a more serious course of the illness.5

Research is also pointing to hypertension (high blood pressure) as a risk factor for more severe complications from COVID-19 infections.6 In a recent interview with CNN, Maria Carolina Delgado-Lelievre, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine explained that people with high blood pressure, which is associated with heart disease, are at higher risk for COVID-19 complications involving multiple organ systems:

If you get an extraordinary viral disease that will damage your lungs, you need a heart that can work with how your body responds to the virus. COVID will cause a systemic reaction in the body of a patient that already has risk.6

Chronic Disease Epidemic Affects Half of U.S. Population

According to the CDC, more than half of Americans are suffering with at least one chronic disease:7

Six in ten Americans live with at least one chronic disease, like heart disease and stroke, cancer, or diabetes. These and other chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in America, and they are also a leading driver of health care costs.

The CDC states, “Obesity affects almost 1 in 5 children and 1 in 3 adults, putting people at risk for chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers,”8 and estimates that the prevalence of adult obesity in the U.S. was 42.4 percent in 2017-2018 and is increasing.9 From 1999–2000 through 2017–2018, the prevalence of obesity increased from 30.5 percent to 42.4 percent, and the prevalence of severe obesity increased from 4.7 percent to 9.2 percent.7

Heart disease, cancer, stroke, obesity and diabetes are among the top contributors to death in the U.S.10 11 12 At the same time, mounting scientific evidence suggests that chronic inflammation in the body is a marker for most chronic disease,13 14 including hypertension,15 obesity, 16 and diabetes.17

According to the Diabetes Research Institute Foundation, 34.1 million adults in the U.S. age 18 years or older have diabetes, which translates to 13 percent of all American adults.18 The American Heart Association reported that in 2013-2014, $329 billion was used to treat cardiovascular disease and stroke.19

Chronic Diseases and Susceptibility to Serious COVID-19 Infections

On Apr. 22, 2020, the Journal of the American Medical Association published an article describing the characteristics, clinical presentation and outcomes of 5,700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area. Researchers confirmed that the most common co-morbidities were hypertension, obesity and diabetes.20

Commenting on the link between chronic diseases and individual susceptibility to infections like COVID-19, author Nicole Saphier, MD, a radiologist at New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center told the New York Post “About [89 percent] of the [12,192] people who have died in New York of COVID-19 had chronic illness as well.” She said:21

This is on us. We left ourselves vulnerable to this epidemic. Our health-care system would not be so overwhelmed right now if it was not already overwhelmed with our preventable chronic illnesses. Obesity is linked to diabetes, high blood pressure and stroke. All of those conditions render us susceptible to infectious illnesses—just what we are seeing with COVID-19… I feared that the fact we lead the world in obesity could put us at risk. And unfortunately I think the data is showing that suspicion to have been correct.

Links Between Poor Nutrition, Infectious Disease and Chronic Disease

The effect of nutrition on the development of the human immune system begins at the embryonic stage in the womb.22 After birth, breast milk provides critical vitamins, minerals and other nutrients to a newborn baby, which has a profound impact on the baby’s health and development of a healthy immune system. A malnourished baby is more vulnerable to infectious diseases.23

According to a 2011 U.S. Surgeon General’s report:24

Breast milk is uniquely suited to the human infant’s nutritional needs and is a live substance with unparalleled immunological and anti-inflammatory properties that protect against a host of illnesses and diseases for both mothers and children.

Good nutrition in adults, along with proper exercise and managing stress,25 helps reduce susceptibility to chronic disease, which in turn reduces susceptibility to infectious diseases. Pinchas Cohen, MD, dean of the University of Southern California Leonard Davis School of Gerontology was quoted in an American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) article on why chronic health conditions like diabetes increases risks for complications from infections like COVID-19. Dr. Cohen said:26

“With diabetes, the high blood sugar is damaging to a lot of different systems in the body, including your immune system.” He adds that, “So by getting your diabetes under control, you’re actually leading to improved immune function. It’s really uncontrolled diabetes that puts you at risk for secondary infections, including coronavirus.”

Will Newborns Be Separated from Parents for COVID-19 Testing?,"Opinion | The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the biggest funder of vaccines in the entire world and, according to Gates, its COVID-19 vaccination effort “dwarfs anything we’ve ever worked on before.”1 Indeed, Gates push for mandatory COVID-19 vaccination—and investment in those vaccines—is historically unprecedented.

In an Apr. 30, 2020 GatesNotes post,2,3 Gates even states he “suspect[s] the COVID-19 vaccine will become part of the routine newborn immunization schedule.” In other words, a novel vaccine that alters your DNA and RNA—turning your body into an antigen-producing factory—will be given to newborns, if Gates has his way.

What could possibly go wrong? If history tells us anything, we know that just about anything could or will go wrong if the CDC adds the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine on the newborn vaccine schedule.

Considering the vast majority of COVID-19 deaths occur in the elderly, why would babies, who are the absolutely lowest at-risk age group, need vaccination against COVID-19 in the first place? There’s absolutely no evidence to suggest vaccinating babies would prevent them from spreading the virus if infected, or develop lifelong immunity.

Newborns to Be Tested and Separated from Infected Mothers

In related, beyond ludicrous news,4 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now recommending5 newborns be tested for COVID-19—not just once, but twice—and separated from mothers with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. As reported by CBSN Pittsburgh May 26, 2020:6

‘The recommendation is the baby be tested sometime around 24 hours after birth. And if the test is negative, they’re recommending a second test at 48 hours,’ says Dr. Paul Weinbaum, an obstetrician at the Allegheny Health Network. And these babies must be kept apart.

The baby should not only be separated from other babies but perhaps separated from the mother if that’s feasible,’ he said … If the baby’s tests are negative, the separation is over. But what happens if a baby tests positive? ‘They don’t recommend keeping these babies in the hospital,’ says Dr. Weinbaum.

Early Separation Can Have Lasting Psychological Effects

If you ask me, separating newborns from their mothers due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (especially if it’s only “suspected”) appears not only unnecessary at best but foolhardy and cruel at worst—especially in light of the fact that only three pediatric deaths from alleged COVID-19 illness have been reported7 in the U.S., and the fact that such separation has been proven to cause emotional and neurobiological problems well into adulthood. As stated in a 2018 article in Psychological Science:8

The attachment bond between a mother and her child is first formed in the womb, where fetuses have been found to develop preferential responses to maternal scents and sounds that persist after birth …

These rapid early-learning processes continue during the newborn stage of development, in which children begin to recognize their mothers’ faces and voices.

From this point on, early maternal separation can result in a series of traumatic emotional reactions during which the child engages in an anxious period of calling and active search behavior followed by a period of declining behavioral responsiveness.

In a study of infant rats, [Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychology director Myron] Hofer found that this behavior was largely a response to the loss of warmth a child receives through bodily contact, nutrients, and other physiological interactions with its mother …

The research suggests that withdrawing maternal support early in a child’s life can have a number of physiological and behavioral consequences that may contribute to a complex, changing pattern of vulnerability over the life span …

Such findings are not entirely new. According to a 2011 study9 published in Biological Psychiatry, evidence shows “separating infants from their mother is stressful to the baby.” As reported by Science Daily:10

Researchers measured heart rate variability in 2-day-old sleeping babies for one hour each during skin-to-skin contact with mother and alone in a cot next to mother’s bed. Neonatal autonomic activity was 176% higher and quiet sleep 86% lower during maternal separation compared to skin-to-skin contact.

Dr. John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry, commented on the study’s findings: ‘This paper highlights the profound impact of maternal separation on the infant. We knew that this was stressful, but the current study suggests that this is major physiologic stressor for the infant.’

While that 2011 study claimed to be one of the first providing evidence that separation causes undue stress, other studies have been published since then, showing the same thing.

Examples include another 2011 study,11 which found “mother-child separation of a week or longer within the first two years of life was related to higher levels of child negativity (at age 3) and aggression (at ages 3 and 5),” and that “the effects of separation on children’s aggressive behavior are early and persistent.”

Similarly, a 2012 study that looked at “physical and emotional closeness between the preterm infant and parent in the neonatal intensive care unit” found physical and emotional closeness are “crucial to the physical, emotional and social well-being of both the infant and the parent,” and that such closeness is an important part of healthy infant brain development.

Based on the historical failures to defend against coronaviruses with a vaccine, this could become one of the biggest public health disasters in the history of the world.

COVID-19 Vaccine Likely To Be Riskier Than Most

The COVID-19 vaccine is the most fast-tracked vaccine ever created in history, and some companies are skipping previously required safety testing steps, such as animal testing.12,<13

Phase 1 human trials have already begun for a few different COVID-19 vaccines within weeks of the infection hitting the U.S. In the Moderna trial of an experimental coronavirus vaccine,14 one of the subjects developed a fever “of more than 103 degrees” Fahrenheit, fainted, and reported feeling “more sick than he ever has before” after his second dose.15

Moderna and several other competitor vaccine manufacturers are using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to make their vaccines rather than live or attenuated (inactivated) viruses grown in animal cells.16 (The GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi COVID-19 vaccines, on the other hand, will be produced in insect cells with the dangerous squalene oil adjuvant.17) As explained by The New York Times:18

… messenger RNA … carries the instructions for cells to make proteins. By injecting a specially designed messenger RNA into the body, the vaccine could potentially tell cells how to make the spike protein of the coronavirus without actually making a person sick.

Because the virus typically uses this protein as a key to unlock and take over lung cells, the vaccine could train a healthy immune system to produce antibodies to fight off an infection … But no vaccine made with this technology for other viruses has ever reached the global market.

So, not only are we dealing with a novel virus, the mechanics of which are still under debate (some experts are now saying it appears to be a genetically engineered virus that attacks the blood19 more so than the lungs, for example), they’re also fast-tracking experimental RNA-based vaccines that have never been licensed or used in humans before.

As explained in “Fast-Tracked COVID-19 Vaccine — What Could Go Wrong?” previous attempts to create coronavirus vaccines have failed due to coronaviruses triggering production of two different types of antibodies: one that fights disease, and one that triggers paradoxical immune enhancement that often results in very serious disease and/or death when the patient is exposed to the wild virus.

Based on the historical failures to defend against coronaviruses with a vaccine, this could become one of the biggest public health disasters in the history of the world. And, not one of those involved would face any repercussions. Instead, they will all profit from it.

COVID-19 Vaccine Will Alter Your RNA and DNA

I recently interviewed Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the nonprofit National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), about these fast-tracked vaccines and the simultaneous push to make them mandatory for travel, if not for work and social life in general.

As noted by Fisher, the mRNA vaccines being developed against COVID-19 will alter your RNA and DNA, which is of tremendous concern. As mentioned, the idea behind them is to turn your body into an antigen-manufacturing plant, and if your immune system is hypersensitive, it could overreact, causing severe problems. Considering how many people have autoimmune diseases and allergies, these vaccines could have devastating effects for many.

When you try to stimulate strong inflammatory responses in the body … what is this going to do to people who don’t resolve inflammation in the body and become chronically inflamed and chronically ill and disabled?” Fisher said.

“This is what vaccines do. They stimulate inflammation in the body. They have to in order to provoke an antibody response, but this is atypical. When you’re trying to do this in the body, this is not a normal way that the body mounts an inflammatory response to a microbe.

They’ve turned everything upside down and we are just accepting it. Why are we not thinking critically? Why do people think that they shouldn’t really do the research and look at the science and look at what’s being done before they take a pharmaceutical product or a vaccine? This is what I don’t understand. We’ve totally given up our critical thinking ability …

I think … you need to get educated, you need to get the accurate facts. Mercola.com and nvic.org, we do our research. We reference all of our information because we want you to have accurate information, and you need to share that information with your family, friends, community leaders and legislators, because the only way that we’re going to be able to change government is by electing people who are going to reflect our values and beliefs.

Does the State Own Your Baby?

As reported in “Children Taken From Parents Who Refuse Vitamin K Shots,” an increasing number of parents question the routine practice of injecting their newborns with vitamin K1, and some hospitals have started harassing and even removing newborns from their parents, calling parents’ refusal of the shot “medical neglect.”20

While vitamin K1 is necessary for newborns, the painful (and potentially toxic) injection is not. You can safely and noninvasively normalize your baby’s vitamin K1 level with oral drops.

In his 1999 paper, “Babies Don’t Feel Pain: A Century of Denial in Medicine,” David B. Chamberlain, PhD, a psychologist and co-founder of the Association of Pre-and Perinatal Psychology and Health, wrote:21

The earlier an infant is subjected to pain, the greater the potential for harm … We must alert the medical community to the psychological hazards of early pain and call for the removal of all man-made pain surrounding birth.

A 2004 study22 found that very early pain or stress experiences have long-lasting adverse consequences for newborns, including changes in the central nervous system and changes in responsiveness of the neuroendocrine and immune systems at maturity. Similar findings were also published in 2008.23

In 2019, several Illinois families who experienced harassment and investigation by the Division of Children and Families Services over refusal of the vitamin K shot have filed a class action lawsuit against local hospitals (Silver Cross Hospital, Advocate Christ Medical Center and the University of Chicago Medical Center), the American Academy of Pediatrics, DCFS and several pediatricians.24

The fact that doctors, nurses, DCFS workers and state health officials are trying to circumvent parents’ rights to make medical decisions for their children is disturbing in the extreme.

Chances are, the fight over who really has control over your children is likely to heat up once again if or when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available and is added to the federally recommended childhood vaccination schedule, which is being turned into state law in most states. Before the time comes when a COVID-19 vaccine is mandated not only for all children but for all adults, too, I hope you all join us in the fight for freedom of choice.

To prepare, I urge you to sign up for the National Vaccine Information Center’s online Advocacy Portal, a tool you can use to communicate with your elected representatives. This free service monitors vaccine-related state legislation throughout the U.S. and alerts you when proposed bills are moving in your state.

NVIC also provides you with fact-based talking points you can share with your legislators to educate them about the need to protect the legal right to make voluntary decisions about vaccination for yourself and your children.

New York Nursing Homes in Crisis During COVID-19 Pandemic,"On Mar. 25, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued an order requiring nursing homes to accept on an expedited basis all new or returning residents with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 who are discharged from the hospital after being diagnosed as medically stable.

The order states:

No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.1

NY Governor’s Order Puts Nursing Home Residents and Staff At Greater Risk for COVID-19 Infections

Critics of the Governor’s order have included nursing home staff, families of residents, the nursing home industry, public health experts and other groups arguing that forcing nursing homes to accept residents, who are or may be infected with COVID-19 and still contagious, puts all residents and staff at greater risk.2

The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, which represents medical professionals working in nursing homes, stated, “We find the New York state advisory to be over-reaching, not consistent with science, unenforceable, and beyond all, not in the least consistent with patient safety principles.”3

In response to this criticism, Gov. Cuomo stated, “They don’t have a right to object. That is the rule and that is the regulation, and they have to comply with that. If they can’t do it, we’ll put them in a facility that can do it.4

The Governor warned nursing homes that failure to follow state orders to re-admit residents with COVD-19 and to follow state rules for managing these patients could lead to an investigation by New York state officials and the attorney general, fines and the risk of losing their license to operate a nursing home.5

Nursing homes can’t discriminate against COVID-19 patient but, if the nursing home staff is unable to safely accept patients and comply with state regulations, they have the option of transferring them to other facilities or notifying the Department of Health. However, nursing homes have a “tremendous financial incentive” to take in COVID-19 patients according to Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition in New York, an advocacy group for residents.6

The recent Order issued by Governor Cuomo is generating concern because the elderly population, especially those with underlying chronic poor health conditions that affect many residents in crowded nursing homes, are at higher risk for COVID-19 complications. In fact, Governor Cuomo previously stated that, “Coronavirus in a nursing home can be like fire in dry grass”7 and that nursing homes are a “feeding frenzy for this virus.”8

In early March, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said:

… the risk group is very, very clear. It’s so clear that the overwhelming weight of serious disease and mortality is on those who are elderly and those with a serious comorbidity: heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, obesity, respiratory difficulties.9

Nursing Homes Hit Hard by COVID-19 Infections and Deaths

New York nursing home residents have been especially hard hit by the new coronavirus because it is easily spread and staff have been hard hit due to lack of enough personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves, and lack of testing kits. Staffing in some nursing homes has been reduced by as much as 50 percent.10

Vulnerable nursing home residents with underlying poor health conditions may not be able to wear masks or wash their hands independently.11 As of Apr. 21, New York state acknowledged that 3,448 nursing home and adult care residents died of COVID-19, which has accounted for 25 percent of all COVD-19 related deaths in New York.12

Prior to Governor Cuomo’s Mar. 25 orders, the Gurwin Jewish Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Long Island had only one confirmed case of COVID-19. After the directive mandating that nursing homes accept patients infected with or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, the situation drastically changed. As the unit designated for COVID-19 patients quickly filled up, 40 long term residents and 50 staff members came down with the virus, in addition to the 18 recovering patients transferred from the hospital. Since then, 24 residents have died.13

As of May 4, 55 residents at the Cobble Hill Health Center in Brooklyn have died in connection with COVID-19.14 The nursing home’s CEO previously contacted the state Health Department seeking for help with transferring infected patients to another facility citing the lack of staff and equipment, but state officials denied the request after making a judgment that the nursing home had adequate facilities to house the sick patients and met their basic needs under the state orders.15

New York state officials did not disclose the fatality rate at nursing homes and assisted living facilities to the public until a report was released in mid-April. The report includes self-reported data collected from nursing homes with five or more deaths and does not include residents that died in hospitals.16 As of May 3, there have been 2,371 confirmed COVID-19 deaths and 2,588 presumed COVID-19 deaths in New York nursing homes and assisted living facilities.17

Creating Designated COVID-19 Facilities Reduces Spread of Infection

Creating designated COVID-19 facilities and separate units in nursing homes could alleviate some of the burden on nursing homes and assisted care facilities. According to the American Health Care Association:

Sending hospitalized patients who are likely harboring the virus to nursing homes that do not have the appropriate units, equipment and staff to accept COVID-19 patients is a recipe for disaster. Governors and public health officials should be working with nursing homes to create as many segregated units as possible right now.18

When Massachusetts and Connecticut freed up hospital beds by releasing medically stable COVID-19 patients, they were sent to designated facilities to try to contain the virus from spreading to other nursing home residents.19 Currently, New York has no plans to create temporary facilities to house COVID-19 patients when they are released from hospitals.20

Hope for Families of Nursing Home Residents

Even before the recent order, nursing home residents and their families faced unique struggles due to the COVD-19 outbreak. Residents have been isolated in their rooms and prohibited from having visitors.21 Families claimed that they were not being informed if a resident tested positive or if they were even alive.22 There have been allegations that residents are not getting food and medicine,23 and that bodies are piling up with dead patients being left in their beds.24

After receiving numerous complaints over the last couple of months, a New York city public advocate and the Brooklyn Borough President asked the state to make policy changes that would mandate that nursing homes supply personal protection equipment to staff, make video communication available for residents to be in contact with families, and issue random inspections.25

In response, on Apr. 16, 2020, Gov. Cuomo signed an executive order requiring that nursing homes and adult care facilities notify family or next of kin within 24 hours when residents have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or died from the virus.26

Gov. Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio announced further plans to help struggling nursing homes. The state attorney general along with the Department of Health will start an investigation as to whether nursing homes are following all state rules and regulations and those that aren’t may be subject to a fine or losing their license.27

Mayor De Blasio announced that the city government is shipping 10 million pieces of personal protective equipment, such as masks, gowns and gloves, to 169 nursing homes each week that will increase by at least 50 percent, and the number of clinical staff volunteers from the city will be doubled. DeBlasio said, Our city’s nursing homes are home to some of those most at risk for COVID-19. They need our support more than ever, which is why we are stepping in and sending more staff and support to assist those who protect and care for our most vulnerable.28

The New York Attorney General’s office announced that a hotline has been set up to take complaints about nursing home abuse and neglect, failure to follow safety rules, or failure to provide adequate communication with families about COVID-19 case and deaths.29

Why “Operation Warp Speed” Could Be Deadly,"Opinion | Politicians are dreaming of a “Manhattan Project-style effort” to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine “for most Americans by year’s end.” To accomplish this dramatic cut in vaccine development time, “the program will pull together private pharmaceutical companies, government agencies and the military.” Normal vaccine development time is significantly longer.

Fourteen potential coronavirus vaccines are vying to be selected as the winner of “Operation Warp Speed.” Government will shield pharmaceutical companies from liability for damages that their vaccines may inflict. Taxpayers will reimburse companies for development costs for vaccines that don’t make it to market.

If you’re cheering the government for cutting red-tape, think again. Liability shields for crony capitalists and no cost for failure policies guarantee errors will be made. Without market safeguards significant injuries to human beings are highly likely. Errors will be exacerbated if medical tyranny prevails with legal mandates requiring the COVID-19 vaccination for employment and travel.

Haven’t we learned there was no such thing as efficient food distribution in the Soviet Union? Haven’t we learned there was no such thing as a safe East German Communist Trabant automobile? There is no such thing as efficient and safe, centrally planned pharmaceutical development. As we will see later in this essay, the last time government sought a “warp speed” vaccine, dead and paralyzed vaccine recipients were the tragic consequences.

Limits on Liability

Pharmaceuticals, including vaccines, have benefits and costs. We don’t have to resolve our cognitive dissonance by denying the benefits of vaccines or denying the harm they can do.

Faced with “challenges to vaccine orthodoxy, scholars, commentators, and public health officials are quick to characterize dissent as mere propaganda of ‘anti-vaxxers,’” writes law professor Efthimios Parasidis in his Boston University Law Review article “Recalibrating Vaccination Laws.”

Parasidis wrote his essay a mere three years ago. Could he have imagined what is happening today, just a few years later? A group affiliated with the FBI is labeling those who question the vaccine orthodoxy as a “threat to national security.” In a similar vein, California State Senator Dr. Richard Pan claims that those demanding an end to lockdowns and those who question vaccines “have the same message: We want you to get sick.” Demonizing dissenters is rhetoric straight out of a totalitarian playbook. People who threaten “national security” and who “want you to get sick” will be ideal “devils” for politicians to blame when their own policies fail.

Parasidis wrote that such tactics obfuscate safety and legal issues, “Focusing contemporary vaccine policy debate on anti-vaxxer rhetoric detracts from adequate consideration of important vaccine-related issues.” In his article, Parasidis points to both “the health benefits of vaccines” and “the shortcomings of the legal framework governing immunizations.”

The shortcomings of the legal framework to which Parasidis refers stem from the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Vaccine Act).

The Vaccine Act granted pharmaceutical manufacturers broad legal immunity from lawsuits for vaccine injuries. Further, Parasidis writes, “once a vaccine is approved and made available to the public, a manufacturer does not have a statutory obligation to actively collect and analyze safety and efficacy data, nor are manufacturers obligated to update vaccine formulas in light of new scientific advancements.”

On top of the protections in the 1986 Vaccine Act, vaccine manufacturers have received additional liability protections under a February 2020 declaration by Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services. Azar claims his authority to make such a declaration is granted by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act).

Azar’s order makes “immune from suit and liability…to all claims of loss,” for all those who “manufacture, distribute, administer, prescribe or use” any treatments or vaccines. Administer a rushed-to-market vaccine to healthy individuals at no particular risk from COVID-19 and the government will shield you from liability. Lobby to make the vaccine mandatory and government will shield you from liability.

Noted vaccine advocates and developers such as Dr. Paul Offit have expressed alarm that “warp speed” developers might ignore standard vaccine development safeguards. “Remember,” Offit cautioned, “You’re giving this vaccine, likely, to healthy people — who are not the people typically dying from this infection.”

Liability shields warp decision-making and increase risk. Having to pay insurance premiums provides incentives to reduce risk. Think of insurance premiums on cars. Insurance premiums might help us decide against the sports car we have been coveting for years in favor of a sedate sedan. High insurance premiums for drivers involved in crashes or caught driving drunk or frequently speeding help those drivers make needed behavioral changes.

If the government indemnified us from damages from driving, risky driving would become more common. Those taking added risks would fool themselves with an illusion of competency. They might be indignant when charged with endangering others.

Libertarian law professor Richard Epstein has explored the problem in limiting liability. Writing about the 2010 BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill, he explained why “the best way to deter future spills is to expose drillers to the full costs of any mistake and not let any company without proper insurance near an oil derrick.”

Let’s rewrite Epstein’s observations: the best way to ensure vaccine safety is to expose pharmaceutical companies to the full costs of any mistake and not let any company without proper insurance near a human body.

Epstein was adamant:

The legal system should never allow self-interested parties to keep for themselves all the gains from dangerous activities that unilaterally impose losses on others—which is why the most devout defender of laissez-faire must insist, not just concede, that tough medicine is needed in these cases.

As Epstein explained, insurance companies are the best regulators:

“A tough liability system does more than provide compensation for serious harms after the fact. It also sorts out the wheat from the chaff—so that in this case companies with weak safety profiles don’t get within a mile of an oil derrick. Solid insurance underwriting is likely to do a better job in pricing risk than any program of direct government oversight. Only strong players, highly incentivized and fully bonded, need apply for a permit to operate.”

Epstein’s logic applies to the Vaccine Act. Pharmaceutical companies are highly incentivized to produce the safest vaccines when they are subject to the discipline of obtaining insurance coverage.

Those advocating in favor of liability shields say that protecting public health requires this waiver. Without the waiver, they claim, too few vaccines would be produced.

The case against liability shields is not a case against vaccines; it is a case against the distorted production of vaccines. Limits on liability override the risk-reducing incentives provided by having to pay insurance premiums and thus result in vaccines that are less safe than they would otherwise be.

Swine Flu Lessons

In his book, The Myth of Scientific Public Policy, economist Robert Formaini challenges the view that elite experts can evaluate public policy objectively “while remaining neutral on troublesome ethical issues.”

Formaini looks at lessons we should have learned from the 1976 swine flu outbreak. The outbreak began at Fort Dix, New Jersey. The flu outbreak was not unusual; it was winter, and in the close quarters of army barracks, respiratory illnesses and flu were common. Formaini writes, “The outbreak may have passed unnoticed except for a bet between two doctors about the nature of the disease.” Throat cultures were sent to multiple health organizations; the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found swine flu.

The CDC asked Congress “for a $134 million program to vaccinate virtually every person within the United States.”

Formaini writes, “Private drug companies did not want to make the vaccine unless they were statutorily protected from liability from torts.” Congress granted such protection despite warnings from some such luminaries as polio vaccine pioneer Dr. Albert Sabin. Sabin “castigated the rush to vaccinate everyone and urged that vaccines be stockpiled for ‘high risk’ groups.” Sabin also derided “scare tactics” used to get people to vaccinate.

Within months, a swine flu vaccine was produced and approved. The CDC failed “to alert the public to any serious potential side effects other than a possible case of ‘mild’ flu.” Even a mild flu can lead “to fatal complications” for “high-risk groups.”

Within days, 33 people who received the vaccine died. Health officials refused to acknowledge the connection between the vaccine and the deaths. “Walter Cronkite chastised his media colleagues” for covering the deaths. Vaccinations continued, and an alarming number of Guillain-Barré syndrome cases, a known potentially fatal side effect of flu vaccines, appeared.

Shortly after that, the CDC director resigned, and government shelved the vaccination program.

Formaini raised pointed questions that should be asked again today in the rush for a COVID-19 vaccine. Among those questions were:

Why did “experts immediately decide” that “universal vaccination was the only option?” “Why were the drug companies released from liability if the ‘risks’ were so small?” “Why was disengagement so difficult when the program’s consequences began to materialize?” “Who ought to have been liable for this policy?”

Today’s experts are like the experts in the 1970s who were full of hubris and overconfidence. Policy analysts who later examined the 1976 swine flu concluded among other things:

“There was overconfidence by medical specialists in theories ‘spun’ from ‘meager evidence.’” “Conclusions were reached ‘fueled by conjunctions’ with pre-existing ‘personal agendas.’” “There often was ‘premature commitment’—deciding more than had to be decided.” There often was “insufficient questioning of scientific logic and implementation prospects.”

Distorted decision-making was driven by “rent-seeking” by public officials during this crisis where “the heads of bureaucratic departments or agencies,” sought expansion of “their personal empires within the government.”

Reading Formaini, it is easy to see the same mistakes of 1976 repeated in 2020. In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius observed of politics, “All of this has happened before. And will happen again—the same plot from beginning to end, the identical staging.”

Biochemical Individuality

The late biochemist Roger J. Williams is famed for his study of the implications of biochemical individuality. His research explains the importance of understanding that “real people exhibit individuality and in a sense are always exceptional people.” Biochemical individuality explains why, for some, a coronavirus vaccine may help to maintain health; for others, it may prove deadly.

In his essay “Individuality and Its Significance in Human Life” contained in the Liberty Fund book Essays on Individuality, Williams writes: “Concerning the ubiquity of individuality, we can, I believe, accept without danger of contradiction the categorical statement that every human individual (even in the case of identical twins) is distinctive and different.”

Yet, in medicine, often only lip service is paid to individuality. We like “the idea of distinctiveness,” yet, as Williams observes, we are “all the time being ignorant about the character of the differences and perhaps even assuming they are inconsequential.”

Williams explores startling differences in our organs: “Although the textbook picture of the human stomach, for example, is well stereotyped, there are enormous variations in shape and about a sixfold variation in size.” Even the position of the stomach in the body may vary by up to eight inches.

Similar differences in size and position are found in livers and intestines. Should we be surprised, Williams asks, “that people exhibit individuality in their eating?”

Williams explains that “Each individual has a highly characteristic breathing pattern,” and “has a distinctive heart action.”

“Endocrine glands vary widely from individual to individual.” Williams adds that “our entire nervous system is subject to the same wide variation, which is not only anatomic but physiological as well.

If you’re thinking all these differences even out and most people are average, you would be wrong. The chance that we have an average anatomical makeup, according to Williams, is only about one in 1024.

Physiological individuality is also the norm. For example, there are up to “100 fold variations in the taste sensitivity of different individuals for such common substances as sugar [and] salt.” Nutritional needs vary up top fivefold for vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.

In short, Williams writes, “Whether we consider heart action, brain waves, circulation, breathing, the endocrine functions, the blood, temperature regulation, or a multitude of other facets of physiology, the story is the same—abundant evidence of individuality involving differences of great magnitude.”

Biochemical individuality has great significance for the administration of drugs or vaccines. Since body chemistries differ among individuals, reactions to pharmaceuticals also differ.

According to Williams, “Some specific chemical reactions may be taking place 10 times as fast in one individual as in another.” Consider that “Using objective tests 10.5 percent were intoxicated when the alcohol blood level was 0.05 percent, whereas 6.7 percent were sober when the alcohol blood level was eight times this high or 0.4 percent.”

There is no “normal man” for which a particular reaction is guaranteed.

Williams emphatically rejects the assumption of “every recognized treatise in the fields of biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and physiological psychology… that normal man, the prototype of all humanity, is the primary if not the exclusive object of study—he, above all is to be fathomed and understood.”

Caution is warranted. Previous attempts to develop “SARS coronavirus vaccines” led to “pulmonary” issues in animal testing. Vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) led to enhanced disease response among infants and toddlers. “Frequent hospitalization” was the result; an unacceptable result since RSV illnesses are usually mild. Despite “expert” assurances to the contrary, medical research suggests receiving a flu vaccination “may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as virus interference.”

The Greater Good?

Some might say, yes, mandatory vaccines may harm some, but the greater goal of protecting public health is worth the price. This “greater good” mindset led to the famed New York Times correspondent Walter Duranty covering up Stalin’s atrocities. Duranty was fond of saying, “You can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.”

Immunization levels thought to generate herd immunity, “magic numbers,” have never been proven as public health historian James Colgrove reports in his book State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America.

In 2009, during another swine flu outbreak, in their essay, “Does the Vaccine Matter?” Shannon Brownlee and Jeanne Lenzer report of doctors challenging the medical orthodoxy about flu vaccines and antivirals. They provided evidence that “flu vaccines do not protect people from dying—particularly the elderly, who account for 90 percent of deaths from seasonal flu.”

Vaccination may have unintended psychological consequences as well. Brownlee and Lenzer observe a connection between vaccinating and “breeding feelings of invulnerability, and leading some people to ignore simple measures like better-than-normal hygiene, staying away from those who are sick, and staying home when they feel ill.” Feelings of invulnerability lead people to eschew responsibility and become potential breeding grounds for disease.

Nothing we can do will guarantee health, but there are steps we can take that tilt the odds in our favor. Sugar-laden diets suppress the immunological system, while exercise boosts it. This year, the average American will eat nearly 200 pounds of disease-promoting sugar and corn syrup and will consume only about 6 pounds of disease-fighting broccoli and a mere “2 to 3 cups of kale every year — one of the healthiest foods on the planet.”

Biochemical individuality explains why, for some, a coronavirus vaccine may help to maintain health; for others, it may prove deadly. Biochemical individuality also explains why there is no one best way to a healthy immune system. Some thrive on keto diets, while others thrive on vegan diets. Others seek a middle ground in a Mediterranean diet.

For some, perhaps those in crowded urban environments, taking a COVID-19 vaccine may seem like a wise choice. Individuals choosing to be vaccinated deserve the safest possible vaccine, a vaccine for which insurance companies insuring vaccine manufacturers will provide liability protection.

For those who wish to avoid a COVID-19 vaccine, fundamental natural rights guarantee that freedom. No individual should be forcibly injected with a vaccine because of policy mandates from self-interested and zealous “expert” decision-makers.

Williams is clear: “Among the myriad of potentialities with which every individual is born, there still are an infinite number of possibilities of development—provided this ability to order one’s own life exists.” “In medicine,” Williams writes, “recognition of the scope and importance of individuality is indispensable to progress.”

For a central planner, individuality is a meaningless idea. Central planners will ignore Williams’s admonition at our peril.

New York on PAUSE During COVID-19 Outbreak,"New York has been struggling with responding to one of the worst COVD-19 outbreaks in the world. As of Apr. 25, 2020, an estimated 271,600 people in New York State and 141,754 in New York City have been infected with COVID-19.1

In response to this health crisis, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has issued an emergency public health order called PAUSE (Policies Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone) that requires all non-essential workers to stay home and bans all non-essential public gatherings through Apr. 29.2 In addition, individuals judged to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications, including those over 70 years of age and those with compromised immune systems or other underlying chronic conditions are bound by Matilda’s law, which requires them to:

remain indoors except for solitary exercise outdoors;

pre-screen all visitors and aides;

wear a mask when with others;

stay six feet away from people; and

be banned from visiting homes with multiple people or from using public transportation unless it is urgent.3

Punishment for Violating Home Quarantine Orders

Violating New York’s stay at home orders can have serious legal consequences. Non-complaint citizens could face fines up to $1,0004 and in some cases, be arrested. New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said that “a range of available methods” can be used and “ultimately summons and arrest is one of those options, but that’s the last resort.”5

Since early March, mandatory quarantine has been required for all New York City residents who:

have tested positive for COVID-19;

been in close contact with someone who has tested positive without symptoms; or

have been to China, Italy, South Korea or Italy and have symptoms.

Those under mandatory quarantine may not leave their private property, must stay six feet away from others and may not use stairways or elevators in buildings.6

Breaking mandatory quarantines can result in fines between $200 to $2,000 per day and “Violations that pose an immediate danger to the public can also result in arrest and prosecution on a misdemeanor charge.”7 NYC Department of Health employees have the “legal authority make arrests, use physical force and conduct searches.”8

Vigilante Neighbors Turning In Neighbors

New York City residents are being asked to monitor each other and contact the police to turn in fellow citizens appearing to violate the “six feet away” social distancing orders.9 An anonymous complaint may be filed against businesses, friends, and neighbors using a form on the New York state website.10

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has encouraged citizens to take and text photos and locations of people suspected of violating PAUSE to a government hotline. According to the Mayor,

Now it is easier than ever. When you see a crowd, when you see a line that’s not distanced, when you see a supermarket that’s too crowded, anything, you can report it right away so we can get help there to fix the problem…Now it’s a simple as taking a photo. All you got to do is take the photo and put the location with it, and bang, send a photo like this, and we will make sure that enforcement comes right away.11

Some New Yorkers have heeded the call. A Brooklyn bar owner was reported and became the first person arrested for violating PAUSE on Mar. 30.12

Early Release of Jail Inmates

While the movements of ordinary citizens are being monitored and restricted, jail inmates, including those charged with violent crimes are being released in unprecedented numbers after attorneys argue they are being put at risk for being infected with COVD-19 if they remain in custody. Generally, jail inmates have been arrested and are awaiting trial, a plea agreement or sentencing, are serving a misdemeanor offense or who have been sentenced and are awaiting transfer to another facility.13

New York’s Board of Corrections instructed the city to,“(1) immediately remove from jail all people at higher risk from COVID-19 infection; and (2) rapidly decrease the jail population.” 14

On Rikers island 1,000 inmates have been released due to an infection rate of 1.5 percent among inmates with 75 cases of coronavirus reported among the prison population of 5,000 and 80 cases among staff members and the Department of Correction as of Mar. 25.15 16

Since the start of the outbreak through April 22, there have been 1,500 inmates released from New York City jails.17 Governor Cuomo ordered the release of 1,100 parole violators, approximately 300 of which were facing violent felony charges.18 19

This mass release of inmates and prisoners has met with resistance by some New York state officials. Sheriff Errol Toulon Jr. of Suffolk County fought to prevent 100 Suffolk County inmates confined to prison hospitals with substance abuse and mental illness from being put on the streets, arguing that they could be more likely to contract the virus on the streets.20

Violent Offenders Released From Prison Over Objections of Prosecuters

In order to determine which inmates would be eligible for early release, defense attorneys and the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice compiled a list of inmates with underlying health conditions. The list was presented to each prosecutor’s office for prosecutors to sign off on or object to the release. Prosecutors have complained that their objections are not being heard and inmates serving time for violent crimes, such as domestic violence and sex offenses, have been released.21

However, the city’s district attorneys and the Special Narcotics prosecutor sent a joint letter to the Mayor de Blasio and the Department of Correction’s Commissioner, Cynthia Brann, agreeing that, while the inmate population should be decreased due to the threat of COVD-19, there are concerns about releasing violent offenders.

At the same time, we want to make clear that the categories of those proposed for release have, in some instances, included individuals who pose a high risk to public safety. In such instances, we have communicated our concerns, but these concerns have not always been heeded.22

According to ABC News, inmates charged with violent crimes awaiting trial are being released from prisons and jails over prosecutor’s objections by filing a writ of habeas corpus, which grants a judge the right to decide whether imprisonment is lawful or immediate release is warranted.23 24 This process has resulted in the release of violent offenders, including an inmate who was charged with brutally stabbing his girlfriend to death before witnesses, a murder that was caught on a surveillance tape.25

Victims and families of victims are not being warned when an inmate is released and run the risk of meeting the offender on the streets.26 Objecting to the release of violent offenders, Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark issued a statement relaying that,

My duty is to protect the public, and the victims and survivors who remain vulnerable knowing that many of the individuals who were incarcerated are returning to the community.27

The New York Police Department which as protested that that they were not consulted on the majority of releases, has warned that, “the re-offenders are “targeting the most vulnerable victims” once they’re out.”28

Some Released Inmates Committed More Crimes

The coordinated effort between the Department of Corrections, the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, and the New York Police Department to follow up and monitor the released inmates has not been uniformly effective.29

According to police sources and police records, at least 50 (six percent) of the released prison inmates have already been detained and released again for committing crimes as soon as they were back on the streets, which has created a revolving door of arrests and releases.30

The New York Post reported that on Rikers island, one inmate, who was jailed for allegedly setting his girlfriend’s door on fire and choking her mother, was granted early release only to return to his girlfriend’s apartment and allegedly threaten to kill her whole family.31 Another Rikers Island inmate accused of rape was arrested for the attempted rape of a 58 year old woman he grabbed on the street just days after his early release to reduce spread of COVID-19 in prisons.32

One inmate has been rearrested five times for burglary and drug charges since his early release, while another inmate with multiple pending burglary and grand larceny charges who was released early for medical reasons, broke into a store stealing approximately $9,000 from a safe.33

In addition to the risk of inmates committing crimes when they are released early, allowing inmates with health conditions who have been living in close quarters back on the streets could cause the virus to spread to greater numbers of people. This risk would likely increase when an inmate is released only to be arrested and released again.

Is PAUSE Making New York Safer for All?

The New York City Police Department has been working with a reduced staff as officers have been calling in sick during this outbreak. In March, CBS News reported that as many as 11 percent of the department called in sick on one day.34

The department will be further taxed with inmates on the streets, the public contacting the police whenever it appears that social distancing orders are not being followed, and citizens being arrested for non-essential gatherings.

As New York follows PAUSE orders, will the city’s jails be filled with citizens suspected of getting together to play a game of basketball or attend a family gathering while violent criminals are released on the streets?

Threatening citizens with arrest and detaining them for getting together while releasing inmates early, challenges the notion that New York City’s policies in response to COVID-19 are truly making the city uniformly safer for all.

Face Masks to Prevent COVID-19: Conflicting Facts & Advice,"In a media briefing on Mar. 30, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officials confirmed that facial masks for the prevention of COVID-19 should be worn by those who are sick or in close contact with those infected, and are not recommended for healthy members of the general population.1 A day later, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence reassured Americans that, “The average American does not need to go out and buy a mask.” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, MD told Fox News the same day that masks were “not effective” to the general public and tweeted the admonition, “Seriously people-STOP BUYING MASKS!” Despite this guidance, masks and other supplies started to fly off the shelves as Americans stocked up due to fears of an outbreak.2

Conflicting Messages Sow Confusion

Then, on Apr. 3, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did an about-face and recommended that everyone use a simple cloth face covering when entering public spaces. Public health officials explained that the face masking policy reversal reflected new concerns that the novel coronavirus was being spread by healthy but infected people who had no symptoms.

The CDC’s new face masking recommendation did not give many details about what kind of face coverings should be used beyond: “cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.”3

After announcing the new recommendation, President Trump appeared to weaken the recommendations by stating, “This is voluntary. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.” Dr. Adams admitted that the CDC’s guidelines on face masks have “been confusing” for Americans and he posted a 45-second do-it-yourself mask tutorial the next day.4

To further confuse the situation, the World Health Organization (WHO) released new guidance three days later on Apr. 6 saying that healthy people do not need to wear face masks, and that masks should be reserved for the sick, their caretakers, and healthcare workers. The WHO said there’s some evidence that caretakers of infected people can protect their health by wearing masks but warned:

There is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (whether medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking, can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.5

The WHO went on to say that community masking could lead to a “false sense of security” and cause people to ignore other evidence-based measures like hand washing and self-isolation.5

Efficacy of Face Mask Use Unclear

Lisa Brosseau, MD, an expert on respiratory protection and infectious diseases, explains:

When we talk, breathe, cough, or sneeze, we’re producing particles. Some of those particles may be droplets and others may be aerosolized. If you’re infected with a virus, it’s very possible virus will be inside the particles you produce…The size and concentration of these particles will differ depending on if they were produced by a cough or an exhaled breath, but the underlying principle is the same. Large particles will fall to the floor relatively quickly; small particles will travel further.6

Small particles don’t necessarily have a smaller “viral load” according to Dr. Brosseau, who hypothesizes that smaller particles are generated from the deeper part of the lungs where there’s more infection. She maintains that those smaller particles can travel farther and are more likely to slip through protective masks.6

For this reason, Dr. Brosseau disagrees with the CDC’s new guidance for face masking. She said wearing a face mask gives people a false sense of security:

If an infected person wearing a cloth mask coughs, there’s some possibility the mask could block the lateral projection of large particles But it’s not going to do much of anything for those smaller particles. I don’t think it should be a blanket recommendation. It gives people a false sense of security and encourages them to stop isolating, which is really the only thing that’s going to work.6

George Rutherford, MD, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco’s School of Medicine agrees that social distancing is essential and that cloth masks don’t provide the same protection as someone wearing a perfectly fitting N95 mask. But, he argues, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”6

The CDC reports that recent studies show a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus are asymptomatic. Even those who eventually develop symptoms are thought to transmit the virus to others through coughing, sneezing or speaking before they show symptoms. Therefore, they say that a cloth face covering in public settings where physical distancing is difficult to maintain is meant to protect other people in case an individual is infected.7

How Long Does COVID-19 Remain on Surfaces or in the Air?

A recent study8 found that the SARS-CoV-2 (the virus believed to cause COVID-19) could remain on common surfaces for up to 72 hours or in the air as an aerosol for up to 3 hours. Linsey Marr, PhD, an expert on aerosol transmission of viruses at Virginia Tech University told The New York Times in March 2020 that an aerosol released at a height of about 6 feet should fall to the ground after 34 minutes. The amount of the virus that lingers in the air as an aerosol is also likely too small to infect someone, she said:

It sounds scary. But unless you’re close to someone, the amount you’ve been exposed to is very low.9

The WHO has cast doubt on study findings suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible as an airborne pathogen, arguing that the experiment used “a high-powered machine that does not reflect normal human cough conditions” and therefore “these initial findings need to be interpreted carefully.” However, Donald Milton, MD, a professor and infectious disease aerobiologist at the University of Maryland, counters that, “Epidemiologists cannot tell the difference between droplet transmission and short-range aerosol transmission,” so because of the uncertainty about COVID-19, WHO should “employ the precautionary principle to recommend airborne precautions.”10

Shortages of Masks Tied to U.S. Exports in Early 2020

The N95 medical-grade masks, which are designed to fit tightly to the face, appear to be effective at filtering viruses for workers in health care settings. However, hospitals continue to report a shortage of masks.

On Feb. 25, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that there were “30 million N95 respirators in the national strategic stockpile” and that 270 million more face masks were needed for health-care workers.11 Since then, the CDC has continued to warn that N95 and surgical masks are critical supplies that must be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders.

An investigative report by USA Today published on Apr. 2, 2020, revealed one big reason for the shortage: millions of surgical masks were exported from the U.S. to China in January and February of 2020:

U.S. exports of surgical masks, ventilators and other personal protective gear to China skyrocketed in January and February, when the coronavirus was wreaking havoc in the country where it began and as U.S. intelligence agencies warned it would soon spread. American companies sold more than $17.5 million worth of face masks, more than $13.6 million in surgical garments and more than $27.2 million in ventilators to China during the first two months of the year, far exceeding that of any other similar period in the past decade, according to the most recent foreign trade data available from the U.S. Census Bureau.12

Does Face Masking Work for the Average Person?

Some experts have said there is little need for the average person to wear a face mask to prevent getting infected with or transmitting COVID-19. “In the research that’s been done, we don’t see any benefit at the community level for wearing the mask,” said Amanda McClelland, MPH., a senior vice president at Vital Strategies, a public health organization that focuses on global health threats.13

But studies of dorms and other high-density settings like households do show some efficacy for masks, according to Raina MacIntyre, PhD, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales Sydney in Australia. A 2010 study14 found that the combination of mask use, providing alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and education about hand and cough hygiene reduced the prevalence of flulike illness inside a college dorm to a greater degree than only hand and cough hygiene education. “If they work in high-transmission settings, they should also work in low-intensity settings,” Dr. MacIntyre said.15

A 2011, Cochrane reviewed 67 studies16 and found that face mask use, hand washing and isolating sick people, especially when used together, can be effective in containing transmission of viral infections in epidemics.

“The argument is that since anyone can be infected without knowing it and spread the infection, that everyone should wear masks,” said University of Maryland professor Donald Milton, PhD. He added, “In the U.S., where we are not prepared to test rapidly and aggressively trace and quarantine all contacts, surgical masks could be helpful.”

Are Homemade Masks Effective?

Evidence of the effectiveness of homemade masks is mixed. A study published in the British Medical Journal in 201517 found that healthcare workers using cloth masks were more likely to be infected with respiratory diseases than those who used disposable surgical masks, even when workers washed them at the end of each shift. Two laboratory studies18 19 demonstrated that masks made of household materials such as T-shirt scraps, tea cloths, or vacuum bags, aren’t as effective at blocking particles of virus in droplets and aerosols as surgical masks.

Still, the homemade masks did provide some protection—especially those made of vacuum bags, tea towels, and blended cotton fabric. A 2006 study20 of homemade T-shirt masks found they could provide a “measurable level of protection” from a challenge aerosol.

While some experts say wearing a homemade or purchased mask may help you remember not to touch your face, others note that they can be uncomfortable and require frequent adjustment. Individuals are also likely to take a mask off to eat or drink, then put it back on afterward. That defeats the purpose, said McClelland. She said:

People contaminate themselves more by touching the mask and taking it on and off their face.3

Deborah Birx, MD, coronavirus response coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, notes that mask wearers must still continue other safety measures, including social distancing.

“Because homemade ones are not even as effective at filtering out virus as commercial surgical masks, which are not great, people should be aware that these are not protective and should not do anything you would not do without one of them on,” Dr. Milton said.

Proper Face Mask Use is Key Says Surgeon General

Dr. Adams says people should wash their hands before donning a mask and avoid touching their faces while wearing one. He also advised people not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth while removing the covering, place the covering where it won’t be touched by anyone else in the house and where it won’t contaminate other surfaces, and wash hands right away.

Masking Requirements by State Governments Vary

The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings “in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”21 Although there is no national mandate by the federal government, several states and municipalities in the U.S. now require everyone to wear masks.

State government officials in New York joined Maryland and New Jersey in ordering residents to wear masks in certain situations. Los Angeles officials are requiring shoppers and workers to wear face coverings during “essential shopping,” and have authorized employers to refuse any employee not wearing a face covering entry to a work space.22

Universal Face Masking to Prevent Stigma and Discrimination?

Globally, face mask recommendations vary across countries. Use of masks in community settings appears to increase substantially once local epidemics begin. This increase in use of face masks by the general public contributes to the supply shortage of face masks in some countries, sending prices soaring and risking personal protective equipment (PPE) supply problems for frontline health care workers.23

There are societal and cultural paradigms around the wearing of masks to prevent transmission of infections. While face masks are commonly used as a preventive public health practice in many Asian countries, in European and North American countries it is something people only consider doing when they are sick.

Some social scientists and public health professionals believe that universal masking by the sick and healthy alike prevents identification, stigmatization and discrimination against individuals who wear masks because, if everyone wears a face mask, there are no perceived differences between the healthy and the sick.24

Google Will Track Cell Phone User Locations to Monitor “Social...,"Story Highlights Google has launched a new electronic surveillance initiative that collects location data from users of Google products and services, including cell phones, to track “social distancing” activity and publicly post “Community Mobility Reports” on a new Google website.

Google surveillance reports will track and publicly report on the movements and activity of electronic product users in six locations that include (1) retail and recreation; (2) grocery and pharmacies; (3) parks; (4) transit stations; (5) workplaces and (6) residential areas.

Google’s surveillance initiative has raised privacy concerns about collection of data on the movements of people within population areas.

Google has announced that it will use its storage of electronic data to track and publicly report on the movements of individuals at the population level during the COVID-19 pandemic. The electronic surveillance initiative utilizes information that Google has collected on users of Google cell phones and products, such as Google Maps, to create reports on the degree to which populations in different areas are conforming to government “social distancing” measures.1

Google maintains it has consulted with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the new surveillance tool.1 The “mobility reports” will be posted publicly on Google’s new website to show whether particular localities, states or countries are seeing more or less people gathering in different types of public spaces.1

According to Google’s website: “As global communities respond to COVID-19, we’ve heard from public health officials that the same type of aggregated, anonymized insights we use in products such as Google Maps could be helpful as they make critical decisions to combat COVID-19. These Community Mobility Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential.”2

Information Included in Google’s Electronic Surveillance Reports

According to Google, the company plans to publish a series of “Community Mobility Reports” to show the types of places people are visiting across 131 countries and regions.3 The reports contain data from two to three days earlier and will show trends in how populations in different areas are behaving and responding to government “social distancing” regulations, including how many people are still going to work or entering shops and grocery stores, pharmacies, parks and other public spaces.

The electronic surveillance reports will also show traffic comparisons in terms of how busy these places were before the pandemic.3 In the United States, the data will be drilled down to the county level.1

Google said the surveillance data will be collected in aggregate form rather than at an individual level and it will not report absolute numbers of people showing up at parks or grocery stores.4 According to the company, the idea is to outline activity in percentages, which highlight potential surges in attendance.4 For example, in its first report, San Francisco County has seen a 75 percent drop in retail and recreation, a 55 percent decline in parks’ population and a 21 percent increase in residential population between February 16, 2020 and March 29, 2020.5

Data Will be Given to Government Officials

Google has said that this type of electronic surveillance data could be useful in alerting local health departments to identify the next potential COVID-19 hotspot combined with other forms of surveillance data routinely collected by government agencies on a local, state and federal level.5 The data will assist public health officials with targeting specific regions with messaging about the need to abide by social distancing rules and not enter parks or other public spaces where residents routinely gather.

Public health officials want to use the information to monitor populations in different countries as people start to return to school and work after COVID-19 quarantines are lifted to measure disease incidence in areas that are congested and heavily active.4

Google Denies Privacy Violations

Google’s new enterprise has prompted renewed privacy concerns about Google collecting information on the movements of users of Google cell phones and other electronic products.4 Google maintains that the Community Mobility Reports are powered by the same “anonymization” technology that they use in their products every day.6

Google’s blog post states that for these mobility surveillance reports, the company will use differential privacy, which adds artificial noise to the datasets enabling high quality results without identifying any individual person.6 The blog post adds that Google product users have control over whether or not they want to be tracked by turning the Location History setting “on” or “off”: “The insights are created with aggregated, “anonymized” sets of data from users who have turned on the Location History setting, which is off by default. Users who have Location History turned on can choose to turn the setting off at any time from their Google Account, and can always delete Location History data directly from their Timeline.”6

Chinese Taken from Homes by Police to Coronavirus Quarantine Camps,"The New York Times on Feb. 6, 2020 was the first mainstream media outlet to report that Chinese government authorities responding to the country’s coronavirus epidemic had ordered round-the-clock house to house police searches to take the temperatures of all residents in Wuhan and detain anyone found to be sick or suspected of being sick using force, if necessary, and then “warehousing them in enormous quarantine centers.” A senior Chinese official announced that both the city where the epidemic began and the whole country face “wartime conditions” and that “There must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever.”1

On Feb. 8 and 9, the UK newspaper Daily Mail posted a video filmed in Wuhan showing people suspected of being infected forcefully being dragged from their homes by officials wearing masks and white protective suits, as the men and women shout out in protest and unsuccessfully struggle to break free.2 Another video shows officials wearing masks, dressed in black and carrying large metal sticks chasing a man suspected of being infected with coronavirus through the largely deserted streets of the city as he runs away trying to escape from being put into one of the mass quarantine camps.

Chinese authorities have encouraged people to inform on each other, with money rewards being offered to those who report suspicions about neighbors they believe may be infected. In some cases, doors of homes have been barricaded from the outside to keep those suspected of being infected inside, with warning signs posted to keep others away.3 According to a Feb. 4 New York Times article:

All across the country, despite China’s vast surveillance network with its facial recognition systems and high-end cameras that is increasingly used to track its 1.4 billion people, the government has turned to familiar authoritarian techniques—like setting up dragnets and asking neighbors to inform on one another—as it tries to contain the outbreak.4

WHO: “Very Grave Threat for the Rest of the World”

On Feb. 11, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared that China’s coronavirus outbreak poses a “very grave threat for the rest of the world.” He called for creation of a roadmap to accelerate development of drugs and vaccines “around which research and donors will align.”5

Dr. Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva:6

To be honest, a virus is more powerful in creating political, economic and social upheaval than any terrorist attack… A virus can have more powerful consequences than any terrorist action…If the world doesn’t want to wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number 1, I don’t think we will learn from our lessons.

As of Feb.11, there had been 43,139 cases of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) confirmed globally. All but a few hundred cases had occurred in mainland China with a total of 1,018 reported deaths.7

Similar to influenza, there has been an overall case fatality rate of between two and three percent so far for COVID-19. Like with influenza, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates is the cause of between 12,000 and 60,000 deaths in the U.S. every year,8 and other respiratory diseases caused by viruses or bacteria, pneumonia is the most frequent and severe complication of novel coronavirus infection that leads to hospitalization and death. Those over age 50 with underlying chronic health conditions like heart disease or diabetes, especially men, are thought to be at greater risk for pneumonia complications of the novel coronavirus infection.9

The origin of the COVID-19 outbreak that began in Wuhan, China is still being investigated.10 11

Whistleblower Doctor Dies in Hospital

According to the Feb. 6 New York Times article, the people of Wuhan were shaken by the police action following an “emotional gut punch” news report that a young doctor, who had been silenced for warning people late last year that there was an unusual coronavirus outbreak in the city, had died at the Wuhan City Central Hospital from the infection. CNN reported that the 34-year old opthalmologist, Li Wenliang, had been questioned by local authorities in December 2019 after he alerted colleagues and was “later summoned by Wuhan police to sign a reprimand letter in which is was accused of ‘spreading rumors online’ and ‘severely disrupting social order.’”12

Dr. Wenliang became a hero figure in China and there are questions surrounding his death because he was threatened with punishment by the police and most coronavirus deaths have been senior citizens with underlying health conditions.13 An unnamed senior advisor to the Chinese government reportedly told the Financial Times that, “In the current political atmosphere, which values obedience more than competence, local officials have an incentive to avoid taking responsibility.”14

The Feb. 6 New York Times article described the feeling of despair among residents in the city of 11 million this way:

With the sick being herded into makeshift quarantine camps, with minimal medical care, a growing sense of abandonment and fear has taken hold in Wuhan, fueling the sense that the city and surrounding province of Hubei are being sacrificed for the greater good of China.

Hospitals Built, Quarantine Centers Created for Sick People

In the past four weeks, China has built several new hospitals and created makeshift medical treatment centers in a sports stadium, an exhibition center and building complex, in an attempt to house thousands of sick people. Reports from Wuhan suggest that there is a shortage of protective gear, as well as medical supplies to test and treat sick patients and that many Wuhan residents with respiratory symptoms are being left untested and untreated.

Outside observers are asking questions about whether the shelters are equipped with enough medical supplies and food or are staffed well enough to provide basic care to patients and prevent spread of not only coronavirus infections, but also a range of bacterial and viral diseases that can spread easily in crowded facilities.15

China Censoring Information on Social Media Platforms

According to a Feb. 6, 2020 report by China Media Project, Chinese authorities have been censoring information published by news organizations and social media platforms criticizing the government’s response to the outbreak:16

A notice issued yesterday by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the central agency for control of the internet and social media, provides a glimpse not just of the actions being taken now by the authorities to control information about the coronavirus epidemic, but also of the platforms and activities that have threatened the Party’s dominance of information in recent days. The notice, for example, singles out a number of WeChat public accounts alleged to have “illegally carried out reporting activities,” meaning that they are accused of acting journalistically, pursuing their own information on the epidemic. It orders the removal from app stores of “Pipi Gaoxiao,” a platform for the sharing of short videos, suggesting that material on the platform has “spread panic.”

On Feb. 7, Bloomberg News reported that two Chinese citizen journalists Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin “have served as the world’s eyes and ears inside the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak” in Wuhan by broadcasting scenes real time via their cell phones. Many of their videos have been posted to Twitter and reposted on YouTube.17

Fang was briefly detained by authorities for taking video of corpses in a hospital and for filming officials in hazmat suits breaking down his apartment door to take him into quarantine, but was released after thousands of public comments urging that he be set free. Chen, who had posted on Twitter that, “It’s easy to put 1,000 beds in a stadium, but how do 1000 people eat together? How to bathe, how to go to the toilet?” was first reported missing and then reported to have been arrested by authorities and put in quarantine.18

Bloomberg News observed:

China’s internet watchdog has stepped up its policing efforts, announcing on Wednesday it would conduct “targeted supervision” on the largest social media platforms including Weibo, Tencent’s WeChat and ByteDance’s Douyin. The regulator has already frozen a raft of social media accounts, then stepped up online scrubbing to quiet a wave of confused outrage over the death of the doctor that first raised red flags about the disease. In this environment, U.S.-based Twitter has emerged as the destination for locals seeking information about the spread of the virus. It’s officially banned in the country, but many people hop the Great Firewall and access the platform via virtual private networks.19

Cruise Ships Detained in Japan and Italy

Globally, the cruise line industry has been hard hit by quarantine measures taken by governments. Thousands of passengers and crews on big oceanliners are unable to disembark if someone on the boat tests positive for coronavirus.

CNN reported on Feb. 4 that some 6,000 passengers on a cruise ship in Italy were quarantined at the end of January after two guests were suspected of being infected but then tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus. Japan ordered a lockdown and quarantine of more than 3,500 passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama harbor after it was revealed an 80-year old man from Hong Kong flew to Tokyo and spent a few days on the ship and later tested positive for coronavirus.20 Five days later, NBC reported that 70 passengers on ship had tested positive for coronavirus, including 14 Americans, and medication was being distributed on board to those who needed it, while some of the sick passengers have been taken to hospitals. The ship is expected to remain in quarantine until Feb. 19 and trained counselors are counseling passengers experiencing stress by telephone.21

Daily Mail reported on Feb. 8 that Britain is considering a ban on travel into the country by foreign nationals who have visited China in the previous 14 days, a ban that has already been put in place by 16 countries, including the US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.22 A professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was quoted as saying that modeling showed there are “ten times more cases [of coronavirus infection] than have been reported—or even more” because “It’s a mild disease that might be missed if somebody doesn’t seek healthcare. And none of the tests is going to be 100 percent sensitive so it is not unusual to only capture maybe 10 percent of the cases.”

U.S. Declares Public Health Emergency, Bans Entry of Foreign Nationals

On Jan. 31, 2020, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Alex Azar held a press conference and declared a public health emergency in the U.S. due to the coronavirus epidemic in China.23 He said U.S. citizens, who have been in China’s Hubei Province the previous 14 days will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine prior to entering the U.S. In addition, the U.S. is temporarily suspending entry of most travelers who have recently been in China if they are not U.S. citizens.24

According to National Public Radio (NPR), at the HHS press conference the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci, MD, said, “People want to know why we’re paying so much attention to the novel coronavirus.” He pointed to seasonal influenza, which Dr. Fauci said is predictable, but with the coronavirus “there are a lot of unknowns” and “the numbers of cases has steeply inclined each and every day.” Fauci added that at the beginning of the outbreak, it wasn’t clear whether an infected person without symptoms could transmit the virus to another person but it is now known there are “asymptomatic infections.”25

At the same time, Bloomberg News reported that:26

The coronavirus has been compared to the flu, which every year infects 10 million to 50 million people in the U.S., leaving tens of thousands of people dead, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s a mild-mannered serial killer. The aggressive response to the coronavirus is meant to stop the new pathogen from becoming a deadlier copycat.

According to Bloomberg News, the Director of the Emergencies Programme of the World Health Organization (WHO) said, “A relatively mild virus can cause a lot of damage if a lot of people get it.”

U.S. Military Prepares Quarantine Centers

On Feb. 1, 2020, the Secretary of Defense (DoD) Mark Esper approved a request from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for housing support at military bases for 1,000 people, including American citizens who arrive from other countries and could be subject to mandatory quarantine. Pentagon officials selected four military installations as quarantine centers, including in Fort Carson, Colorado; Travis Air Force Base and Marine Corps Air Station in California and Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. DoD personnel would only provide housing support and HHS would be responsible for all care and transportation of those being quarantined on military bases.27

According to a Feb. 1 Reuters article, an anonymous source at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that the mandatory quarantine is the first in more than half a century and that “state and local authorities will likely play a role with mandatory quarantines:”28

“Since this hasn’t been done in 51 years there’s quite the scramble to work through all the procedures,” a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official said, adding that the last mandatory quarantine was ordered to fight smallpox. The official, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said DHS personnel would take over running medical screenings at airports this weekend to free up their CDC counterparts for other tasks. State and local authorities will likely play a role with mandatory quarantines, the official said, which could mean “a lot of variance across the country for how it gets implemented.”

On Feb. 6, the DoD received an additional request from HHS officials to assist with the creation of more quarantine sites at military bases near 11 major commercial airports to detain and test passengers suspected of being potentially infected with COVID-19. The list includes Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI (HNL); Great Lakes Training Center Navy Base, IL (ORD); Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base, TX (DFW); March ARB, CA (LAX); Travis AFB, CA (SFO); Dobbins ARB, GA (ATL); Fort Hamilton, NY (JFK); and Naval Base Kitsap, WA (SEA).29

HHS Asks for Expanded Emergency Powers in 2016

The year after measles outbreaks were reported at Disneyland in 2015, HHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Aug. 15, 2016 Federal Register to amend the Public Health Service Act. The amendment gave federal government officials expanded police power to restrict the freedom of a person entering the U.S. or traveling between states if officials believe the person is infected or could become infected with certain kinds of diseases.230

Until the 21st century, the list of contagious diseases permitting federal government officials to detain and involuntarily quarantine people was confined to a very serious contagious diseases with high mortality, including yellow fever, smallpox, cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, and the plague.31 32Polio was never put on the list.

Between 2003 and 2014, HHS officials advised two Presidents to issue Executive Orders to expand the “isolate and quarantine” list. In 2003, Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers, such as Ebola, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS were added.33 In 2005, pandemic influenza was added.34 In 2014, the Presidential Executive Order did not name a specific disease that would warrant detention and quarantine, it simply described “diseases associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness” that have “the potential to cause a pandemic” or are “highly likely to cause mortality or serious morbidity if not properly controlled.”35

"The WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Lead Global Vaccine Marketing","The following article is the second of three excerpts from a report, WHO, Pharma, Gates & Government: Who’s Calling the Shots?, which was published by the National Vaccine Information Center on Jan. 29, 2019.

Immediately after World War II in 1945, the United Nations (UN) voted to establish a new international health organization. In 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) was founded by the UN after ratification by 26 members states and given a budget of $5 million. WHO is a specialized agency of the UN headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and is composed of six regional offices operating in different parts of the world, including the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) located in Washington, DC. Today, 194 members states of the United Nations are impacted by the activities of the WHO, which has a broad mandate to “act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work.”52

The WHO Constitution, revised in 2006, states that its objective “is the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health” and health is defined as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” The WHO Constitution also states that, “Informed opinion and active co-operation on the part of the public are of the utmost importance in the improvement of the health of the people.”53

The top priorities of the WHO when it was founded 70 years ago were malaria, tuberculosis, venereal diseases, maternal and child health; sanitary engineering and nutrition. During the first 30 years of WHO’s operation, the UN agency spearheaded a global smallpox eradication campaign (1958-1980); prevention and control of yaws, endemic syphilis, leprosy, trachoma, cholera and yellow fever (1960s); fertility regulation and birth control (1970s) childhood vaccination programs (initiated 1974) and the institution of primary health care of all national health systems (initiated 1978).54

U.S. Government & Gates Foundation Biggest Funders of WHO

Today, the WHO is the world’s largest and most influential public health agency with an annual budget for 2018-2019 of $4421.5 million ($4.4 billion).55 About 20 percent ($956.9 million) of the WHO budget is funded by assessments on member states and the remaining 80 percent is funded by “voluntary contributions.” The biggest individual programs funded by WHO are for polio eradication vaccine campaigns ($903 million); vaccine campaigns for other communicable diseases in developing countries ($805 million); and corporate services/enabling functions ($715.5 million).

Currently, the top 10 UN member state annual funders of WHO are the governments of United States of America ($125 million); Japan ($49 million); China ($40 million); Germany ($33 million); France ($27 million); United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ($23 million); Brazil ($19.5 million); Italy ($19 million); Canada ($15 million); Australia ($12 million).56

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest non-state funder of the WHO, having donated more than $2 billion in earmarked grants to the international health agency since 1998, and is the second largest WHO funder overall (after the U.S. government). Because Gates Foundation grant money is earmarked for specific programs, such as vaccine purchase, delivery and promotion, the Gates Foundation significantly influences the setting of WHO’s program priorities.57

WHO Scientists & Conflicts of Interest During 2009 Flu Pandemic

In 2010, after a joint investigation by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in collaboration with the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, an article was published in the BMJ revealing that three key scientists, who influenced the WHO’s decision to declare a swine flu (H1N1) influenza pandemic in 2009 and recommend that all countries use and stockpile vaccines and pandemic flu drugs, had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies profiting from the WHO recommendations (GlaxoSmithKline and Roche). WHO was also criticized for lack of transparency for refusing to release the identities of the 16 members of an Emergency Committee formed in 2009 to guide pandemic policy.58

The 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine, which was rushed to market to address a WHO declared pandemic that did not happen, triggered an autoimmune reaction in more than 1,300 people in Europe who got GSK’s Pandemrix vaccine and left them with narcolepsy, an incurable immune mediated neurological disorder.59

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Marketing Vaccines

The WHO and the U.S. government are founding partners of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. In 2000, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided $750 million in seed money to spearhead the creation of Gavi, a public-private partnership and multilateral funding mechanism involving the WHO, governments, the vaccine industry, the World Bank, philanthropic foundations and civil society groups to “improve access to new and underused vaccines for children living in the world’s poorest countries.”60

Of the more than $15 billion raised by Gavi since 2000 to vaccinate the world’s children, U.S. government contributions have totaled $1.9 billion or 12 percent of all contributions received by Gavi. The United Kingdom has contributed $2.2 billion or 14 percent of Gavi’s total contributions. The single biggest funding source for Gavi is the Gates Foundation, which has donated more than $3 billion or 20 percent of Gavi’s total income.61

80 Percent of Gavi Funds Used to Purchase, Deliver, Promote Vaccines

Between 2000 and 2013, only about 10 percent of total funding provided by Gavi ($862 million) was used to strengthen health systems in developing countries, such as improving sanitation and nutrition, while nearly 80 percent as used to purchase, deliver and promote vaccines.62

Gavi is headquartered in Geneva with an office in Washington, DC that carries out day-to-day operations and one of Gavi’s core goals is to “shape markets for vaccines and other immunization products.”

In 2008, Gavi announced that five countries—Italy, Norway, Canada, the UK and Russia—had joined the Gates Foundation to pledge $1.5B in the Advance Market Commitments (AMC) to accelerate access to pneumococcal vaccines with donors providing up front funding commitments to support vaccine purchase and speed the introduction and use of vaccines in countries partnering with Gavi.

Currently, the AMC incentivizes vaccine manufacturers to sign contracts to provide pneumococcal vaccine to developing countries at lower per dose prices and be reimbursed by Gavi funds. By March 2015, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline had received more than $1 billion from Gavi’s AMC funds.63

CDC officials provide Gavi with technical support and guidance. In 2015, the U.S. Congress pledged to appropriate $1 billion to Gavi that was spread over four years (2015-2018).64

UN Global Action Plan Vaccine Marketing Initiative

On Oct. 16, 2018 at the World Health Summit in Berlin, Gavi CEO Dr. Seth Berkley announced that 11 heads of the world’s leading health and development organizations had signed a “landmark commitment” to find news ways to accelerate achieving goals of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals created in 2015. The new Global Action Plan vaccine marketing initiative is being coordinated by the WHO.65 Relating Sustainable Development Goals to vaccination of all the people in the world, Gavi states that:

“immunization protects people from being forced into poverty by high out-of-pocket expenses;”

“vaccines protect child health and support cognitive development, allowing children to perform better at school and have more opportunities;”

“vaccinated healthy children grow into a productive workforce and become strong contributors to the economy, and healthy children free up parents’ time so they are able to work;”

“vaccines are critical to building people’s resilience to and mitigating the risk of disease outbreaks tied to climate change…;” and

66 “good health is a critical determinant of peace and well being in a society. People-centered health systems are core social institutions in every country, and immunisation is often the first point of contact between these systems and the population.”

GAVI CEO: “A measles case anywhere is a threat everywhere”

In 2016, Dr. Berkley and other Gavi executives came under criticism in the UK in 2016 for taking excessively high salary packages. According to an investigative news report: “Seth Berkley has taken home more than £2 million over the past four years as chief executive officer of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), which has been given £1.5 billion by Britain. Another official at the Geneva-based group collects a pay package of more than £500,000 a year. Incredibly, Dr. Berkley was given a housing allowance on top of his £623,370 pay package.”67

In December 2018, Dr. Berkley told CNN that “while measles is one of the few diseases we could potentially eradicate, that will never happen if wealthy countries like the United States can’t maintain herd immunity. Because a measles case anywhere is a threat everywhere.” He said parents in the U.S. are delaying their children’s vaccinations “perhaps because they believe in immunization but are worried by some of the anti-vaccine scaremongering. This needs to stop.” Echoing the idea that parents who don’t go along with the vaccine program are selfish, he added, “in countries like the United States we need to stop thinking about vaccination as something you only do to protect the ones you love, and instead view it also as a goodwill act for the benefit of others.”68

According to the CDC, in 2017-2018 “vaccination coverage among kindergarteners remained high,” with 94 percent of children having received two doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine; four or five doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine and two doses of varicella zoster (chickenpox) vaccine (among many other vaccines required by states for school attendance).

"WHO, Pharma, Gates & Government: Who’s Calling the Shots?","The following article is the first of three excerpts from a report, WHO, Pharma, Gates & Government: Who’s Calling the Shots?, which was published by the National Vaccine Information Center on Jan. 29, 2019.

On Jan. 16, 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a report ranking “vaccine hesitancy” as one of the top “Ten Threats to Global Health in 2019”, alongside air pollution and climate change; noncommunicable diseases; global influenza pandemic; antimicrobial resistance; and infectious diseases such as ebola, dengue fever and HIV.1 Throughout history, the greatest contributors to disease and early death in human populations have been poverty, poor sanitation and poor nutrition,2 3 4 yet infectious diseases with pharmaceutical solutions dominated this list. And there was no mention of the major opioid addiction crisis crippling and killing tens of thousands of people in the U.S. and Europe,5 6 or the iatrogenic medical error epidemic that every year claims more than 750,000 lives in Europe and 250,000 lives in the U.S., where it is the third leading cause of death.8

The immediate mainstream media response to the WHO’s announcement was to focus on “vaccine hesitancy.” On Jan. 19, the Editorial Board of The New York Times declared that “anti-vaxxers” are “the enemy” and called on the U.S. government to “get tough” by waging a “bold and aggressive” pro-vaccine campaign that includes “tightening restrictions around how much leeway states can grant families that want to skip essential vaccines.”9 By Jan. 23, The Hill announced that Washington state had declared a state of emergency because of 23 cases of measles reported in an “anti-vaccination community” near Portland, Oregon,10 and there was a public call in the UK for social media platforms to “clamp down on fake news” and censor “misleading information and negative messaging around vaccination.”11 12

The New York Times editorial headline “How to Inoculate Against Anti-Vaxxers” was a theme repeated in articles reacting to the WHO’s suggestion that people wanting to make informed, voluntary decisions about vaccination are a global menace. One doctor suggested that parents who don’t vaccinate their children are selfish: ”… it’s a matter of ‘I don’t care about other people in the community, I only care about the health and welfare of my own child.’”13

No Discussion About Major Vaccine Issues Concerning People

There was no discussion about institutionally acknowledged gaps in vaccine safety science14 15 or the fact that most parents dutifully follow the advice of pediatricians and public health officials and only became vaccine safety critics after the risks of vaccination for their children turned out to be 100 percent.16 17 No discussion about the fact that since 2011, pharmaceutical companies have no liability for injuries and deaths caused by government recommended and mandated vaccines they sell in the U.S.18 Instead, parents of vaccine injured children and others concerned about vaccine safety, who for decades have been asking government and industry to produce better quality vaccine science and more humane vaccine policies that respect genetic and biological diversity, were stereotyped as “anti-vaxxers” and demonized as a “threat” to public health.

The Editorial Board of The New York Times explained, “It’s no mystery how we got here. On the internet, anti-vaccine propaganda has outpaced pro-vaccine public health information.” Authoritatively, “the Board, its editor and the publisher” of The New York Times stated that, “Scientists are uncomfortable with black and white statements, because science is all about nuance. But, in the case of vaccines, there are some hard truths that deserve to be trumpeted. Vaccines are not toxic, and they do not cause autism. Full stop.”

There was no discussion about why people are legitimately concerned about vaccine ingredients19 and Pharma paying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to fast track new vaccines to licensure without adequate testing.20 No discussion about the fact that doctors are giving children 69 doses of 16 vaccines starting on the day of birth21—three times as many vaccinations as they got in 1983—22 and cannot explain why so many highly vaccinated children in the U.S. are sicker, not healthier today: 1 child in 6 learning disabled23 and 1 in 40 with autism24 and millions more suffering with asthma, diabetes, severe allergies, epilepsy, cancer, schizophrenia, depression and other chronic disease marked by chronic inflammation in the body. The CDC states that, “90 percent of the $3.3 trillion in annual health care expenditures are for people with chronic and mental health conditions.”25 The largely unexplained chronic disease and disability epidemic in the U.S. is bankrupting the U.S. health care system and there is no research being funded to investigate the role that ever increasing numbers of vaccines given to infants, children and adults may be playing.

Multi-national pharmaceutical corporations26 27 in command of a global 34 billion dollar vaccine market28 29 are holding billion dollar contracts with mass communication companies30 and public-private partnerships with governments to purchase vaccines and create vaccine marketing campaigns31 32 33 34 that dwarf the relatively small number of websites and blogs labeled “anti-vax” simply for criticizing vaccine science and government policy.35 Yet, there is no recognition by mainstream media articles of the fact that wealthy corporations and philanthropic foundations with political agendas,36 37 well paid medical doctors,38 39 40 and government health officials in charge of operating the vaccine system41 are in privileged positions of power with a distinct advantage over ordinary people subjected to vaccine laws that place an unequal risk burden on individuals with genetic and biological susceptibility to suffering harm from vaccination.42 43

“Bio-Populism” Blamed for Vaccine Hesitancy in Europe

In the UK, The Economist published an article entitled “The campaign against vaccination,” in which an anonymous author declared, “Across Europe, the rise of populism is damaging public health. A common feature is skepticism of vaccines.”44 Pointing to Italy, Austria and France as hotbeds of political support for “parental choice” about vaccination, the author attempted to politically tie growing public support for vaccine choice to a fear of migrants and coined a new term: “bio-populism:”

It is increasingly clear that Europe’s populists want for the body what they want for the nation: purity, unity and self-governance. Populist health policies mean citizens being free from outside influences—whether vaccines devised by doctors, regulations invented by politicians or diseases supposedly carried by migrants—and in control of their own epidemiology.

He (or she?) went on to explain that bio-populism is a “combination of me-first libertarianism and anti-expertise herd mentality.” Quoting Italian medical professor Dr. Roberto Burioni, who has stated authoritatively that ”Vaccines are not an Opinion” and offered an explanation for “Why Science Can’t be Democratic,” The Economist article ended with a warning that, “At least one pandemic will probably sweep the interconnected world in the next decade…Viruses, after all, know no borders.”

There was no discussion of the fact that most parents and physicians calling for better quality vaccine science and informed consent protections in vaccine laws are ideologically diverse and do not all identify with one particular political party. In fact, a 2015 Pew Research Center survey revealed that age and parenthood had more to do with vaccine hesitancy, with young adults and parents with children under age 18 being less supportive of mandatory vaccination.45

Vaccines, Autism, Erosion of Trust in Drug Companies & Doctors

In the U.S., Live Science trumpeted: “Anti-Vaccine Movement Joins Ebola, Drug Resistance on List of Top Global Threats.”46 A doctor at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security was quoted as saying the reason that noncommunicable diseases and not infectious diseases made the WHO’s top ten global threat list is “a testament to how powerful vaccines are.” Pointing to the jubilant public response to the release of polio vaccine in the 1950s, he commented, “We need to get back to that era when vaccines were celebrated the way a new iPhone [is].”

The headline People Magazine chose was “World Health Organization Names Anti-Vaxxers As a Top Threat to Global Health in 2019.”47 At the beginning of the article, the following statement appeared: “There is no scientific link between vaccines and autism, according to the Centers for Disease Control.” It ended with the statement “To tackle the rising levels of vaccine hesitancy, WHO plans to push forward with the goal of eliminating cervical cancer with greater application of HPV vaccine…”

U.S. News & World Report ran this headline: “WHO: Anti-Vaccine Movement a Top Threat in 2019.”48 That author stated, “So-called anti-vaxxers refuse the required shots for their children on religious or philosophical grounds. An increase in unvaccinated children has, in part, been tied to the medically discredited belief that vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder.” Pointing out that a recent U.S. survey found that public trust in vaccination is on the decline, she added, “The heightened mistrust, researchers said, was especially prevalent in small pockets of people in insular communities or like-minded communities online.”

Pacific Standard asked “Are Anti-Vaxxers A Major Health Threat? The World Health Organization Says Yes.“49 This article included a quote from a pediatrician:

The ongoing erosion of trust in the medical establishment as a whole is also to blame, as frequent reports of dubious financial relationships between physicians, professional medical societies, and the pharmaceutical industry leave many questioning whether or not physicians can be trusted. Unsure of what to do and whom to listen to, many seek answers to their questions elsewhere, or simply rely on their gut feeling…

Salon created the most sensational headline that asked the foreboding question, “The anti-vaxxocalypse” What happens to humanity if vaccine hesitancy continues?”50 The author explained to readers, “In other words, the anti-vaccination movement, which has inspired many in first-world countries to refuse or hesitate vaccination for easily-preventable diseases, is now a threat to global health and, ergo, stability.”

The exaggerated response to the WHO announcement by corporations owning mainstream media outlets has been curiously uniform. Often using identical talking points, perspective from parents and physicians in the U.S. and Europe rationally calling for reform of the vaccine policies and laws is left out.51

The politics of vaccination is in full swing, but where is the money coming from to fund these vaccine marketing campaigns using name calling, threats, shaming and misinformation to demonize and call for discrimination against those who criticize vaccine science and government policy?

"Pharmacists, Pharmacy Interns Given Green Light to Vaccinate Children","Under an amendment to the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP), pharmacists and pharmacy interns in the United States are now permitted to administer vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to children over three years of age.1

Currently, there are 28 states that allow pharmacists to administer vaccinations to children. In 22 states, there are laws that limit which vaccines pharmacists can administer, including three states that prohibit pharmacists from giving vaccines to any children.2

HHS Directive Expands Access to Childhood Vaccines

The new directive allowing pharmacists to administer vaccines to children over age three was declared Alex Azar, head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with the aim of increasing access to CDC recommended childhood vaccines to children returning to daycare, preschool and school after the COVID-19 lockdown that closed day care facilities and schools in most states.3

According to Secretary Azar, “The Trump Administration has worked to allow pharmacists—alongside all of America’s heroic healthcare workers—to practice at the top of their license, empowering the public with more options to protect their health and well-being.”4

The amendment authorizes state-licensed pharmacists, as well as pharmacy interns acting under their supervision, to administer vaccines to children over age three if the pharmacy intern is licensed or registered by his/her state board of pharmacy.5 The HHS authorization also allows state-licensed pharmacies to administer vaccines to the children without a doctor’s prescription.6

CDC Reports Decline in Childhood Vaccination Rates During Pandemic

A report released by the CDC in May 2020 showed that routines childhood vaccination rates had plummeted during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of families staying at home. The CDC report states that orders for because of lockdowns and social distancing requirements keeping families at home. The numbers of childhood vaccines given in doctors’ offices plummeted in late March 2020 and early April 2020 as doctors offices were forced to close or saw fewer patients, raising concerns that vaccination rates would decline.7

Secretary Azar said that this declaration was signed to prevent vaccination rates from falling even further.8

HHS Authorization Subject to Requirements

The amendment authorizes state-licensed pharmacists and pharmacy interns to administer childhood vaccines but is subject to some requirements as listed below:9

The vaccine must be approved or licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The vaccination must be ordered and administered according to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) vaccination schedules.

The licensed pharmacist must complete a practical training program of at least 20 hours that is approved by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE).

The licensed or registered pharmacy intern must complete a practical training program that is approved by the ACPE.

The licensed pharmacist and licensed or registered pharmacy intern must have a current certificate in basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

The licensed pharmacist must complete a minimum of two hours of ACPE-approved, vaccination-related continuing pharmacy education during each state licensing period.

The licensed pharmacist must comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the jurisdiction in which he or she administers vaccines, including informing the patient’s primary-care provider when available, submitting the required vaccination information to the state or local immunization information system (vaccine registry), complying with requirements with respect to reporting adverse events, and complying with requirements whereby the person administering a vaccine must review the vaccine registry or other vaccination records prior to administering a vaccine.

The licensed pharmacist must inform his or her childhood-vaccination patients and the adult caregivers accompanying the children of the importance of a well-child visit with a pediatrician or other licensed primary care provider and refer patients as appropriate.10

American Academy of Pediatrics Opposes Vaccination of Children by Pharmacists

The HHS directive allowing all state-licensed pharmacists and pharmacy interns the ability to administer childhood vaccines is opposed by the American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP).11

According to AAP president Sally Goza, MD, “This move is incredibly misguided. In the middle of a pandemic, what families are looking for is reassurance and clinical guidance from the doctors they trust most to care for their children: pediatricians.”12

Dr. Goza adds:

This unprecedented expansion of pharmacies’ ability to administer vaccines to children is not a solution to the vaccine hesitancy that is driving down rates of childhood immunizations in the U.S. Many parents have questions about their children’s vaccines, and pediatricians are ready to talk with them. It’s what we do, every day, one-on-one with thousands of parents, as part of the long-term trusting relationships that families have with their physicians.13

How Government “Cures” Drive Out Real Cures,"Opinion | Scurvy, we all know, is a disease caused by a vitamin C deficiency. It took almost 200 years from the time a “lemon juice” cure for scurvy was discovered until it was promoted by the British government. Some think the mental biases that caused the needless deaths of millions have been eliminated in more “enlightened” modern times. They are wrong.

In his book, Bad Medicine, history professor David Wootton explains that scurvy “became a major problem only with the beginning of transoceanic voyages.” On those voyages, fresh fruits and vegetables were lacking for at least ten weeks.

On long voyages, the mortality rate from scurvy was 50 percent. Wootton writes, “One estimate is that two million sailors died of this dreadful disease between Columbus’s discovery of America and the replacement of sailing ships by steamships in the mid-nineteenth century.”

Wootton accounts that in 1740 George Anderson commanded a fleet of six ships and 2,000 men and lost 1,800 men to scurvy. During the French and Indian War (1754-1763), approximately 133,000 of 184,000 sailors in the British fleet died from scurvy. Many of the dead sailors had been “press-ganged into service.”

Yet, most of these deaths were avoidable. By 1601 merchant Sir James Lancaster had already solved the scurvy problem by stocking his ship with lemon juice on his voyage to the East Indies. Wootton reports the practice of stocking lemon juice “became standard on ships of both the Dutch and English East India companies in the early seventeenth century.”

Unfortunately, the lemon juice cure, Wootton writes, “made no sense to doctors with a University education, who were convinced that this disease, like every other, must be caused by bad air or an imbalance of the humours.” Pressured by doctors, ship captains refused to stock lemons.

The British Admiralty “formally asked the College of Physicians for advice on how to combat scurvy.” In 1740, 139 years after the lemon juice cure was known, the response of the College of Physicians was to advocate the use of vinegar and Ward’s Drop and Pill. The pill consisted of poisonous ingredients, including antimony, cobalt, and arsenic, thought to purge illness from the body.

Wootton points out that history incorrectly credits a surgeon, James Lind, with discovering the cure for scurvy. Yet, Lind’s “discovery” occurred 150 years after knowledge of the efficacy of lemon juice was known to the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the first American colonists.

Initially, Lind recognized the lemon juice cure but didn’t understand that scurvy was a nutritional disease. He stuck with a humours theory and believed skin pores clogged by damp air caused scurvy. Lind thought lemon juice unblocked clogged pores. Decades after his first success in 1747, Lind himself lost faith in his remedy and again resorted to bloodletting for scurvy patients. It took another 50 years for lemon juice to be generally adopted by the English Navy.

Voices of those who knew the lemon juice cure were rejected. In 1786, a merchant sea captain wrote to the British Admiralty, informing them that lemon juice cured scurvy. The captain was told that trials have been made of the use of lemons in the treatment of scurvy and that surgeons “all agree” that “lemons and oranges were of no service either in the prevention or cure” of scurvy.

The Admiralty issued this “official” advice 185 years after James Lancaster effectively used lemon juice against scurvy. Notice that merchants were more open-minded in their willingness to try new treatments to save lives. Without the power to press gang, protecting crew members and saving lives was paramount. Notably, Captain James Cook, commanding the Endeavour during his 1769 voyage to New Zealand and Australia, bucked the Admiralty by serving sauerkraut and fresh vegetables when he made landfalls. Cook didn’t lose a single crew member to scurvy during his almost three-year voyage. Yet, in 1773 Lind was still insisting diet was not the cause or cure of scurvy.

Wootton is clear; doctors were culpable: “When good arguments are beaten from the field by bad ones, those who do the driving must bear the responsibility.” “Bad knowledge drove out good,” Wootton argues. The advice of doctors was used as a shield by an inflexible government determined not to yield to the evidence.

Gresham’s Law

Is Wootton correct, did bad knowledge about scurvy drive out good knowledge?

Gresham’s Law explains why bad money drives out good money. This law is frequently misunderstood.

Gresham’s Law only is operable when the bad money and the good money are both legal tender. For instance, when both silver quarters and non-silver quarters were circulated side-by-side, the public hoarded the more valuable silver quarters, taking the silver quarters out of circulation. Bad money (non-silver quarters) drove out good money (silver quarters), but that was only because shopkeepers were forced to treat both silver and non-silver quarters as having the same value.

Detractors of free markets frequently seek to apply Gresham’s Law to products other than money. Their antipathy to free markets leads them to claim that the market rewards the lowest common denominator.

Yet, a moment’s reflection shows this to be untrue. A men’s shirt from Walmart peacefully competes with ones from Charles Tyrwhitt, and these stock shirts peacefully compete with custom-made shirts costing hundreds of dollars. Consumers decide which products best fit their needs, given their preferences and income.

Wootton is correct; history shows how bad knowledge drove out good knowledge about the prevention and treatment of scurvy. Gresham’s Law can be applied: The British Admiralty sanctioned the College of Physicians to provide a “legal tender” treatment—ineffective vinegar and poisonous pills. The bad treatment crowded out the good treatment (lemons) on government ships. The British Admiralty was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of sailors by blocking a known effective treatment.

If YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook were around in the 18th Century, would they have censored advocates of lemon juice on the grounds that it undermined “the science” endorsed by the College of Physicians?

Remdesivir

Like the British Admiralty acting on the advice of “expert” physicians, many of our experts and politicians assure the public that for COVID-19 there is no prevention other than lockdowns, social distancing, masks, and soon a vaccine. They claim there is no treatment for COVID-19 other than the astonishingly expensive new drug remdesivir. Remdesivir costs $3,120 a dose and is the only FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19. And yet, remdesivir does nothing to reduce mortality from COVID-19. The United States bought the entire supply of remdesivir at the cost of over $1 billion; great for the politically connected pharmaceutical company Gilead, producing remdesivir. But if remdesivir is the “legal tender” treatment, how does this impact our health?

We have all seen this lousy movie before, but our memories are short. In 2009, during the Swine Flu pandemic, Shannon Brownlee and Jeanne Lenzer asked hard questions about Tamiflu, the “remdesivir” of that time. As with remdesivir, Tamiflu at best reduced the duration of illness without impacting mortality. As with remdesivir, Tamiflu was very expensive and was stockpiled by the government. Brownlee and Lenzer questioned whether “the expensive antiviral drugs that the government has stockpiled” have “power to reduce the number of people who die or are hospitalized?” They report,

“As with [flu] vaccines, the scientific evidence for Tamiflu and Relenza is thin at best. In its general-information section, the CDC’s Web site tells readers that antiviral drugs can “make you feel better faster.” True, but not by much. On average, Tamiflu (which accounts for 85 to 90 percent of the flu antiviral-drug market) cuts the duration of flu symptoms by twenty-four hours in otherwise healthy people. In exchange for a slightly shorter bout of illness, as many as one in five people taking Tamiflu will experience nausea and vomiting. About one in five children will have neuropsychiatric side effects, possibly including anxiety and suicidal behavior.”

In short, antivirals such as Tamiflu “have had their effectiveness overplayed, and harms underplayed.”

Today, politically anointed remdesivir is crowding out the inexpensive 65-year-old generic drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Anecdotal and empirical evidence shows HCQ is safe and effective in treating COVID-19. Bretigne Shaffer has done an outstanding job compiling the known evidence about hydroxychloroquine.

Adnan Munkarah, MD, is Executive Vice President and Chief Clinical Officer, and Steven Kalkanis, MD, is Senior Vice President and Chief Academic Officer of the large Henry Ford Health System in Michigan. They report that hydroxychloroquine significantly cut mortality rates for thousands of their Health System’s patients. Yet, as Munkarah and Kalkanis write, “the political climate that has persisted has made any objective discussion about this drug impossible, and we are deeply saddened by this turn of events.”

“Scientific debate,” they write “is a common occurrence with almost every published study. In part, this is what fuels the advancement of knowledge–challenging one another on our assumptions, conclusions and applications to get to a better place for the patients we collectively serve.”

Scientific debate is being stifled. Dr. Peter Gøtzsche is one of the leading advocates of “rigorous methodology and the elimination of bias in assessing the efficacy of treatments.” In July he warned,

“It has become increasingly difficult to publish articles in medical journals that are critical of drugs or the drug industry, or that expose fraud and other wrongdoing committed by doctors. It is also difficult to publish articles documenting that the status quo in a medical specialty is harmful for the patients even though such articles should be warmly welcomed.”

How much has really changed since the British College of Physicians suppressed a real cure for scurvy in favor of Ward’s Drop and Pill?

With hydroxychloroquine, “experts” led by Dr. Fauci are actively suppressing debate. The FDA has revoked its emergency use permission for hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine is denied to those inflicted with COVID-19, not on the merits of remdesivir, but due to the coercive force of government.

What Government Is Selling

Connecting the dots is easy. The government is spending over $10 billion on its Operation Warp Speed to produce a vaccine that will be shielded from liability.

A rushed COVID-19 vaccine will not go through full safety trials, yet the FDA will probably issue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to approve a vaccine. To issue an EUA, there must be “no adequate, approved, and available alternative.” In other words, HCQ or another effective treatment is a threat to a vaccine; if hydroxychloroquine is effective, there can be no fast-tracked vaccine.

Recently Bill Gates was questioned about the side effects of a COVID-19 frontrunner vaccine being manufactured by biotech start-up Moderna. Norah O’Donnell asked Gates about the alarming report that 80% “of the participants [in the vaccine trial] experienced a systemic side effect.” Gates responded, “The side effects were not super severe; that is, it didn’t cause permanent health problems.” Given the short-term trial time, Gates doesn’t know if there are permanent health problems. Gates’s “not super severe” standard might be acceptable to some people; many others are ready to say no thanks.

Gates then added, the FDA will do a good job [of not allowing a vaccine with severe side effects] despite the pressure. Fauci, too, said he is not worried about side effects of the Moderna vaccine.

Fauci and Gates rely upon the FDA to guarantee safety. In his book Against Leviathan Robert Higgs writes:

“Rather than supplying the quality assurance that people value, the FDA serves, in a sense, as a central planner in the quality-assurance sector of the medical goods economy. The agency imposes a body of rigid, one-size-fits-all rules, binding on everyone regardless of the actual individual differences of people’s medical conditions, personal preferences and attitudes towards bearing risks…Like other forms of central planning, it cannot solve the problems of information and incentives inherent in its way of dealing with the issues within its jurisdiction.”

Higgs quotes former FDA official Dr. Henry Miller as saying, “The gold standard of FDA regulation is fool’s gold.”

As an economist, I’m concerned that liability shields eliminate the essential role insurance companies play in assessing risk. I take seriously the words of Ruud Dobber, an executive at AstraZeneca, another COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer, who said about the worldwide liability shields his company sought, “We as a company simply cannot take the risk if in … four years the vaccine is showing side effects.” As a consumer, I give more serious consideration to Dobber’s reservations than Gates’s “not super severe” assurance of side effects.

A recent survey by KEKSTCNC, a global strategic communications firm, found that in the United States, Americans believe the prevalence and morbidity of COVID-19 are far greater than actual counts. Americans believe an astonishing 9% of Americans have died from COVID-19. The public perception is exaggerated 225x.

If many people you know are in a constant state of fear for themselves and their children, incessantly monitoring themselves for symptoms, now you know why. To the frightened, Dr. Fauci is a hero who they desperately hope will relieve their existential fears of death, an existential dread that many have projected onto COVID-19. They resent when their hero is fact-checked.

Refuse Fauci’s favored vaccine solution, and some advocate the government should force you to take the vaccine or jail you. Such draconian solutions take root when the government feeds existential fears.

There are likely “lemon juice” solutions to COVID-19, and perhaps hydroxychloroquine is one. But a government that suppresses debate and wants to funnel billions towards politically connected firms will discredit all challengers to their favored solutions. In the name of what they define as “the science,” the discovery process of real science is suppressed. Science suppressors are part of an illiberal movement whose members, in the words of Jeffrey Tucker, are “enemies of freedom and human rights.” They threaten the health of billions.

WHO Says No Direct Evidence Masks Prevent Viral Infection,"Opinion | According to the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, life will not be returning to your old normal anytime soon. What’s more, things will only get worse unless the public follow health advice such as wearing masks and social distancing. The somber announcement came during a July 13, 2020, press conference.

This, despite the fact that the WHO’s June 5, 2020, guidance memo1 on face mask use states there’s no direct evidence that universal masking of healthy people is an effective intervention against respiratory illnesses.

What’s more, people are being urged to use cloth masks or bandanas (ostensibly to prevent shortages among health care staff), none of which conform to any kind of quality standards, and according to what little scientific evidence is available have been shown to provide only about half of what little protection you may get from a surgical mask.

No Direct Evidence to Support Universal Mask Usage

SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus with a diameter between 60 nanometers (nm) and 140 nm, or 0.06 to 0.14 microns (micrometers).2 This is about half the size of most viruses, which tend to measure between 0.02 microns to 0.3 microns.3

Virus-laden saliva or respiratory droplets expelled when talking or coughing measure between 5 and 10 microns,4 and it is these droplets that surgical masks and respirators can block.

At present, there is no direct evidence (from studies on COVID- 19 and in healthy people in the community) on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.

For example, N95 masks can filter particles as small as 0.3 microns,5 so they may prevent a majority of respiratory droplets from escaping. They cannot block aerosolized viruses, however, that are in the air itself. Additionally, many N95 masks only protect the wearer, as they have exhalation ports that allow you to exhale unfiltered air.

Lab testing6 has shown 3M surgical masks can block up to 75% of particles measuring between 0.02 microns and 1 micron, while cloth masks block between 30% and 60% of respiratory particles of this size. As noted in the WHO’s guidance memo:7

Meta-analyses in systematic literature reviews have reported that the use of N95 respirators compared with the use of medical masks is not associated with any statistically significant lower risk of the clinical respiratory illness outcomes or laboratory-confirmed influenza or viral infections …

The use of cloth masks (referred to as fabric masks in this document) as an alternative to medical masks is not considered appropriate for protection of health workers based on limited available evidence …

At present, there is no direct evidence (from studies on COVID- 19 and in healthy people in the community) on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.

Curiously, while cloth masks and face coverings are far less effective for blocking respiratory droplets, the WHO recommends that cloth or nonmedical masks “should only be considered for source control (used by infected persons) in community settings and not for prevention.”8

CDC Policy Review Found No Evidence of Usefulness Either

A policy review paper9 published in Emerging Infectious Diseases in May 2020—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s own journal—has also reviewed “the evidence base on the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical personal protective measures … in non-healthcare settings,” and they too found no evidence of benefit:

Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.

Pages 970 to 972 of the review include the following quotes:10

In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs [randomized controlled trials] that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks …

Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids …

There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure.

Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza … In this review, we did not find evidence to support a protective effect of personal protective measures or environmental measures in reducing influenza transmission.

These Mistakes Undermine the Protection Masks May Provide

If and when you do use a mask, you have to follow proper protocols, or else you can nullify what little protection they do offer against potentially infectious respiratory droplets. As detailed in WHO’s guidance memo, you need to make sure your medical mask is:11

Changed when wet, soiled or damaged

Untouched. Do not adjust or displace it from your face for any reason. “If this happens, the mask should be safely removed and replaced; and hand hygiene performed”

Discarded and changed after caring for any patient on contact/droplet precautions for other pathogens

The memo also points out that “Staff who do not work in clinical areas do not need to use a medical mask during routine activities (e.g., administrative staff).” Now, if administrative hospital staff do not need to wear masks, why would healthy individuals need to wear them when walking around, especially in open-air areas?

Broward county, Florida, has gone so far as to issue an emergency order12 mandating masks to be worn inside your own residence. But why, if administrative hospital staff aren’t even advised to wear them at work?

In summary, it is likely that masks are not entirely useless in all circumstances. However, the literature rather strongly suggests the usefulness of masks depends on a significant number of factors—type, fit, length of use, purpose and circumstances—which are effectively impossible to account for in public universal-masking policies.

The science, contrary to the ignorant platitudes we are bombarded with, has NOT proven that universal masking is effective for viral containment, and has instead provided substantial grounds for skepticism of such a policy.

Benefits of Mask Wearing Do Not Include Infection Control

Despite the lack of scientific evidence showing masks do much of anything to prevent the spread of viral infections, the WHO still manages to make a case for universal mask wearing. The “potential benefits” listed, however, have little to do with health, and much more to do with learning submission. According to the WHO, potential benefits of mask wearing include:13

•“Reduced potential stigmatization of individuals wearing masks to prevent infecting others or of people caring for COVID-19 patients in nonclinical settings”—In other words, we should all wear masks to make people caring for COVID-19 patients feel more accepted, as if that’s actually a significant problem. •“Making people feel they can play a role in contributing to stopping spread of the virus”—I.e., masks, while providing a false sense of security, make people feel like they’re “doing something” to help. Put another way, it makes people feel virtuous and “good.” •“Reminding people to be compliant with other measures”—In other words, mask wearing is a sign of overall compliance. •“Potential social and economic benefits”—This is perhaps the most ludicrously strained reason of all. According to the WHO: Encouraging the public to create their own fabric masks may promote individual enterprise and community integration … The production of non-medical masks may offer a source of income for those able to manufacture masks within their communities. Fabric masks can also be a form of cultural expression, encouraging public acceptance of protection measures in general.

Potential Harms and Risks of Mask Wearing

The WHO also lists a number of potential harms and risks of mask wearing, which “should be carefully taken into account when adopting this approach of targeted continuous medical mask use.” These include:14

Self-contamination due to the manipulation of the mask by contaminated hands or not changing the mask when wet, soiled or damaged

General discomfort, as well as facial skin lesions, irritant dermatitis or worsening acne

False sense of security that may reduce adherence to other well recognized preventive measures such as hand hygiene

Disadvantages for or difficulty wearing them by specific vulnerable populations such as those with mental health disorders, developmental disabilities, the deaf and hard of hearing community, and children

Difficulty wearing them in hot and humid environments

Aside from these, several people have demonstrated that masks can rapidly result in the buildup of toxic carbon dioxide, which can have a markedly detrimental impact on health.

In one video, a science teacher tried to evade YouTube censorship by saying children should wear face masks to school—all while holding up handwritten signs informing viewers the tactic was for censorship evasion, and to pay attention to the carbon dioxide metering results, which show carbon dioxide levels behind the mask shoot up above 10,000 parts per million (ppm) after just 10 breaths.

After garnering several hundred thousand views, the video was removed for “violating YouTube community guidelines.”

Del Bigtree of The Highwire has performed an identical demonstration.15 With an N95 mask on, the carbon dioxide level spikes above 8,480 ppm within seconds. Above 5,000 ppm, OSHA warns that “toxicity or oxygen deprivation could occur.”

Carbon dioxide levels between 2,000 ppm and 5,000 ppm are associated with headaches, sleepiness, poor concentration, loss of attention, increased heart rate and slight nausea. The maximum permissible daily exposure limit is 5,000 ppm.

Wearing a standard surgical mask, carbon dioxide levels again reached above 8,000 ppm, although it took longer. Shockingly, wearing a cloth bandana resulted in carbon dioxide buildup near the nose and mouth exceeding 8,000 ppm.

Even wearing a clear plastic face shield (without a mask) resulted in carbon dioxide levels in the 1,500-ppm range, which is associated with drowsiness and poor air quality. The video at the top of this section also addresses many of the potential harms and risks of masks wearing.

Toxic ingredients that can worsen breathing problems are yet another potential hazard of certain masks. For example, surgical masks are made of plastics like polypropylene, a known asthma trigger.16

The 2018 study,17 18 “Hypoxia Downregulates Protein S Expression,” also describes how hypoxia (low oxygen concentration) increases your risk of blood clots by reducing protein S, which is a natural anticoagulant. Wearing a mask, especially for long periods of time, may reduce your oxygen concentration, and considering COVID-19 is already associated with abnormal blood clotting, inducing hypoxia may be ill advised.

PPE Waste Is Becoming an Environmental Hazard

Last but not least, environmentalists are now warning that personal protective equipment (PPE) such as medical face masks may turn into a devastating environmental problem. As reported by The Guardian, June 8, 2020:19

The French non-profit Opération Mer Propre, whose activities include regularly picking up litter along the Côte d’Azur, began sounding the alarm late last month.

Divers had found what Joffrey Peltier of the organization described as ‘COVID waste’—dozens of gloves, masks and bottles of hand sanitizer beneath the waves of the Mediterranean, mixed in with the usual litter of disposable cups and aluminum cans … ‘It’s the promise of pollution to come if nothing is done,’ said Peltier.

In France alone, authorities have ordered two billion disposable masks, said Laurent Lombard of Opération Mer Propre. ‘Knowing that … soon we’ll run the risk of having more masks than jellyfish in the Mediterranean,’ he wrote on social media alongside video of a dive showing algae-entangled masks and soiled gloves in the sea near Antibes.

The group hopes the images will prompt people to embrace reusable masks and swap latex gloves for more frequent handwashing. ‘With all the alternatives, plastic isn’t the solution to protect us from COVID. That’s the message,’ said Peltier.

OB/GYN Docs in U.S. Want COVID-19 Vaccines Tested on Pregnant Women,"A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report1 on pregnancy and SARS-CoV-2 infection released on June 26 suggested that pregnant women may be at increased risk for COVID-19 complications. The report was followed by a statement issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)2 urging that pregnant and lactating women be included in COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics trials and that pregnant women be among the first to get the vaccine after it is licensed.

Pregnant Women Report Fewer COVID-19 Symptoms

The CDC reported that the government’s COVID-19 surveillance program has received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15-44 years) who had positive rest results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Data on pregnancy status was available for 29 percent of the women, and among these, 9 percent were pregnant.

Symptomatic pregnant and non-pregnant women reported similar frequencies of cough and shortness of breath during COVID-19 infections. However, pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea.3

Chronic Conditions Reported During COVID-19 Infections May Be Pregnancy Related

Chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease were reported among pregnant women at roughly twice the rate of those who were not pregnant. However, data was not available to distinguish whether chronic conditions were present before or were uniquely associated with pregnancy (e.g. gestational diabetes or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy).4

More Pregnant Women Admitted to Hospital and ICU for COVID-19 But Death Rates Identical Between Pregnant and Non-Pregnant Women

Approximately one third (31.5 percent) of pregnant women were hospitalized compared with 5.6 percent of non-pregnant women. However data were not available to distinguish hospitalization of women for COVID-19 related circumstances from hospital admission for pregnancy-related treatment or procedures, including birthing.

After adjusting for age, presence of underlying conditions and race/ethnicity, pregnant women were 1.5 times more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and receive mechanical ventilation during COVID-19 infections. Risk of death for the pregnant and non-pregnant women was identical (0.2 percent).5

The CDC data indicates that Hispanic and black women may be disproportionately more likely to suffer complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, which reflects an overall increased risk for COVID-19 complications in Hispanic and black populations in the U.S.6

Limitations of CDC study on COVID-19 in Pregnant Women

CDC officials acknowledged at least four limitations to their report, which include missing data, insufficient time for accurate outcomes, lack of data on trimester of pregnancy at the time of infection and whether the hospitalization was related to pregnancy conditions rather than for COVID-19 illness, and no data on pregnancy or birth outcomes such as pregnancy loss or preterm birth.7

COVID-19 Pregnancy Registries Seek Answers

ACOG represents more than 60,000 physician obstetricians/gynecologists in the U.S.8 In response to the CDC report, the ACOG released a statement advising member physicians of the increased risk to pregnant women of COVID-19 infections. ACOG urged its members to encourage pregnant patients testing positive for COVID-19 to enroll in a COVID-19 registry to help gather more data measuring the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes.9

In April, UCLA Health and the University of San Francisco launched a nationwide registry called PRIORITY (Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY) to study how COVID-19 impacts pregnant women and their newborns. Researchers will collect data throughout pregnancy, then track the new mothers and babies for up to one year.

“The issue is we don’t have data in pregnancy. A lot of this data is extrapolated from other SARS infection, MERS, and non-pregnant individuals,” says Yalda Afshar, MD, assistant professor in the Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine at UCLA Health.10

In May, the PRIORITY study launched the Reproductive Health Equity and Birth Justice Core to focus on the impact of COVID-19 on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities.11 Other COVID-19 pregnancy registries include COVI-Preg, a global collaboration between 198 antenatal clinics from 23 countries,12 the International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy (IRCEP), and Coronavirus Health Outcomes in Pregnancy and Neonates (CHOPAN) in Australia.

ACOG Says Pregnant Women, Breastfeeding Moms Should Be Test Subjects in COVID-19 Vaccine Trials and Be Among the First to Get Vaccinated

In its June 24 statement, the ACOG also stated:

In light of this new information from the CDC regarding the risk to pregnant patients, it is even more concerning that pregnant and lactating patients have been excluded from clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine. The new information from the CDC highlights the importance of pregnant patients being prioritized for a coronavirus vaccine once it becomes available. ACOG again urges the federal government to use its resources to ensure the safe inclusion of pregnant and lactating patients, including patients of color, in trials for vaccines and therapeutics to ensure that all populations are included in the search for ways to prevent and treat COVID-19.13

Questions About Safety of Vaccination During Pregnancy

The time-honored rule of avoiding any potential toxic exposure that might interfere with the normal development of the fetus was suspended and replaced by the CDC in 2006 with an assumption that vaccination during pregnancy was safe after the CDC strengthened recommendations that all pregnant women, healthy or not, should get influenza vaccine during in any trimester. This CDC recommendation was followed up in 2011 with another new one directing obstetricians and gynecologists to administer a pertussis containing Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) shot to all pregnant women during every pregnancy.14 15

Influenza and Tdap vaccines were formerly categorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Pregnancy Category B and C biologicals because it is not known whether they are genotoxic and can cause fetal harm or can affect maternal fertility and reproduction.16 Influenza and pertussis containing Tdap vaccines were not tested in or licensed for use in pregnant women prior to the CDC’s recommendation for their use by all pregnant women, and their use has been considered “off label” during pregnancy.17

The text of one vaccine manufacturer’s prescribing information for the use of Tdap vaccine in pregnant women highlights a critical lack of knowledge about the potential negative biological effects of pertussis containing Tdap vaccine on the pregnant woman and her fetus, which appears to be common for vaccines administered to pregnant women:

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Adacel vaccine. It is also not known whether Adacel vaccine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.” In addition, the following language is common in most vaccine manufacturer prescribing information inserts: “Adacel vaccine has not been evaluated for carcinogenic, mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility.18

About 35 Percent of Women in U.S. Get Vaccinated During Pregnancy

Barbara Loe Fisher, cofounder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) states, “The rush to vaccinate pregnant women and reach into the womb to try to passively vaccinate the developing fetus is a clear case of policy preceding science.”19

A 2019 report by the CDC found that 35 percent of women received both influenza and pertussis containing Tdap vaccines during pregnancy. Anne Schuchat, MD, principal deputy director of the CDC states that for any woman wary of getting vaccinated, “it’s been proven repeatedly that these vaccinations are safe for pregnant women and their developing babies.”20

Civil Liability Waiver Encourages Pharmaceutical Companies to Test Experimental Vaccines on Pregnant Women

The 21st Century Cures Act passed by Congress and signed into law in 2016 amended the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 to give vaccine manufacturers a product liability shield so they can’t be sued in civil court when there is evidence that a federally FDA licensed vaccine (or vaccines) recommended by the CDC for pregnant women injured or caused the death of a woman or an infant born alive who was injured in the womb by a vaccine administered to the infant’s mother.

The fact that commercial pharmaceutical companies producing vaccine products are no longer legally liable for harm caused to pregnant women or their infants during gestation if they are born alive, becomes even more significant as COVID-19 vaccines using experimental mRNA and DNA technology are being fast tracked to market.21 As pointed out in a 2017 review of ethical issues involved in vaccine research on pregnant women:

“As a fetus or infant cannot consent to participation in research, a critical issue is how much risk is acceptable to impose upon the fetus or the infant. For research with the potential of direct medical benefit to the woman or fetus, risk proportionate to the potential benefit is acceptable. For research that does not involve the prospect of direct medical benefit, risk to the fetus must be no more than minimal. However, the definitions of minimal risk in the context of pregnancy are unclear.”

Big Gaps in Vaccine Safety Research and Knowledge Concerning for Pregnant Women

In a response to the FDA’s 2018 proposed guidance for scientific and ethical consideration for inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials, Barbara Loe Fisher and Theresa Wrangham on behalf of the National Vaccine Information Center submitted a public comment and noted the “lack of basic understanding of the biological mechanisms and high risk factors for vaccine injury and death in individuals who are not pregnant hampers the ability to design ethical research into the biological effects of vaccination in pregnant women. The lack of published biological mechanism studies and well-designed prospective case controlled studies that assess immune and brain function and genetic integrity before and after adults or children are vaccinated is of great concern to those being directed to receive all federally recommended vaccines. That justifiable concern is magnified when it comes to the potential adverse effects of vaccination on pregnant women and their unborn infants developing in the womb.”22

Fisher observed that, “This maternal vaccination policy is a violation of the precautionary principle to “first, do no harm,” and warned “it is of grave concern to women having babies in America.”23

Flu Shot Fails to Protect Seniors and May Increase Miscarriages,"Opinion | Flu season is creeping up on us again and there are widespread calls to get your annual flu shot, despite the fact that, year after year, this strategy turns out to have an abysmal rate of effectiveness across the board. One group that consistently turns out to draw the short end of the stick when it comes to influenza vaccine failures is the elderly. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data have repeatedly demonstrated that the flu vaccine does not work for seniors.

Pregnant women are another group that should carefully evaluate the risks and failures of influenza vaccine. The CDC recommends routine flu shots for women during any trimester in every pregnancy, but some scientific evidence suggests it could place their pregnancies at risk.

I’ve written many articles questioning the scientific basis for routine influenza vaccination in general. Here, my focus is the elderly and pregnant women, as there is scientific evidence detailing risks of flu vaccination for both groups.

First, though, I want to remind you of a little-known fact about influenza mortality estimates: Secondary infections such as pneumonia and other respiratory diseases, as well as1 are included in “flu death” statistics, and account for a majority of deaths attributed to influenza every year.

Beware of Sepsis

As discussed in a Health magazine article2 published 2018, the symptoms of sepsis can actually mimic influenza symptoms—with disastrous results. In this particular case, a strep infection progressed to sepsis, which presented as influenza and, unfortunately, led to the amputation of the woman’s arms and legs. She says:3

… if you have a fever that doesn’t go away or your body temperature is abnormally low, you have signs of any type of infection (whether it’s a cold or a UTI) that’s not getting better, you feel confused, or are in a lot of pain, go to your doctor and ask about sepsis.

To learn more about sepsis and its treatment, see “Recognizing the Signs and Symptoms of Sepsis” and “Sepsis Is a Top Cause of Death in Hospitals.” It’s worth finding out about a relatively new sepsis treatment using intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine, discussed in these articles.

The treatment has been shown to be extremely effective—far more so than conventional treatments—but many hospitals have yet to make it routinely available, which means it can be difficult to convince them to use it. It’s worth a try, though.

Why is the Flu Vaccine So Ineffective?

It’s important to remember that the influenza vaccine contains only three or four type A or B vaccine strain influenza viruses, of which there are hundreds. So, even if those vaccine strain viruses are a perfect match for influenza viruses that are circulating in a given flu season, the vaccine does not prevent the majority of other respiratory infections that make people sick and often mistake for influenza unless lab testing is done.4

Twice a year, the World Health Organization issues recommendations on the composition of the upcoming season’s flu vaccines. For the 2019/2020 season, trivalent vaccines distributed in the U.S. will contain:5 6 7

A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus

A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like virus

B/Colorado/06/2017-like (Victoria lineage) virus

Quadrivalent vaccines will contain the three above, plus B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) virus. The selected strains for this year are anticipated to improve coverage. In Australia, where the flu season got an early start in the Southern Hemisphere, health officials told people to get vaccinated because it could be an unusually severe season.8 The predominant influenza viruses circulating in Australia this year have been H3N2 influenza A virus followed by influenza B virus.9

In the U.S., health officials have said that the selection of influenza viruses for inclusion in the vaccine this year occurred later than usual. There are reports that flu vaccine production and shipments have been delayed and there will a shorter window of opportunity to get vaccinated.10

A study11 published in 2018 sheds some much-needed light on unvaccinated individuals at risk for influenza and how as many as half of unvaccinated people infected with influenza do not know they have it. Researchers found that “approximately 1 in 5 unvaccinated children and 1 in 10 unvaccinated adults were estimated to be infected by seasonal influenza annually, with rates of symptomatic influenza roughly half of these estimates.”

Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Has Always Been Low

Historically, regardless of how well-matched the vaccine is to circulating strains, your chances of getting influenza after vaccination are still greater than 50/50 in any given year. According to CDC data updated September 10, 2019,12 the 2018/2019 flu vaccine (all vaccine types) against influenza A or B viruses had an adjusted effectiveness rating of:

29 percent for all ages

49 percent for children aged six months through eight years

six percent for children ages nine through 17

25 percent for adults between the ages of 18 and 49

12 percent for those over 50

two percent for those over 65

Ironically, despite offering no protection for more than two-thirds of the population, health officials in February touted higher numbers, calling them a great success, as the numbers they had at that time outperformed the 2017/2018 vaccine. Obviously, as the Southern Hemisphere’s season wore on, the numbers wore down, and they’re just as abysmal, if not more so, than other years.13

The 2017/2018 seasonal influenza vaccine’s adjusted overall effectiveness for the U.S. was just 36 percent against influenza A and influenza B virus infection.14 15 To put this into context, gargling with tea has been shown to lower your relative risk of the flu by 30 percent.16

Between 2005 and 2015, the flu vaccine’s adjusted overall effectiveness was less than 50 percent more than half the time—with a low of only 10 percent in the 2004/2005 season.17 18

Vaccinated Individuals Pose a Hidden Threat to Public Health

It’s also important to realize that you can get vaccinated, show few or no symptoms of infection, and still shed and transmit influenza to other people.19 20 This scientific fact flies in the face of statements claiming that vaccination is a “social responsibility” that “protects others around you, including family, friends, co-workers and neighbors.”21

In reality, after vaccination, you may actually become a contagious silent carrier of disease. A person with influenza who fully expresses symptoms of fever, body aches, cough and other signs of respiratory illness would likely stay at home. However, a vaccinated individual, who is silently contagious, would go to work and into stores and other public places and be unaware they are spreading infection.

This is an especially important fact for vaccinated health care workers, who move freely among patients in hospitals and other medical facilities because everyone assumes vaccinated medical personnel are “immune” to influenza if they get a flu shot every year.

A study22 published in the journal PNAS January 18, 2018, showed that people who receive the seasonal flu shot and then contract influenza excrete infectious influenza viruses through their breath.

What’s more, those vaccinated two seasons in a row have a greater viral load of shedding influenza A viruses. According to the authors, “We observed 6.3 times more aerosol shedding among cases with vaccination in the current and previous season compared with having no vaccination in those two seasons.”

They also note that other studies suggest annual flu vaccination leads to reduced protection against influenza, which means each vaccination is likely to make you progressively more prone to getting sick.

A 2014 paper23 also reveals how priming your immune system with influenza vaccine can make you more susceptible to infection from other viral and bacterial pathogens. This phenomenon is an effect inherent in what’s known as “heterologous immunity.”

Year After Year, Flu Vaccine Proves Useless for Seniors

As mentioned, the 2018/2019 flu vaccine had an adjusted effectiveness rating of just 12 percent for those ages 50 and above,24 but the full range was between a negative 12 percent to a positive 31 percent for ages 50 to 64 and a negative 29 to 41 in those over age 65. That means that for some people, vaccination actually made them more susceptible to infection. Unfortunately, the nine- to 17-year-old group also had a negative confidence interval.

For infections caused by the A(H3N12) virus, the statistics were even more worrisome, with a mere overall adjusted effectiveness of nine percent for all ages. For A(H1N1) the numbers were better at 44 percent—but it’s worth noting that the CDC chose to lump all ages together in that report, rather than breaking them down by age (something they had done earlier in the year, and which they had done for all past years). For example:

In 2017/2018, 25 26 the adjusted influenza vaccine effectiveness for all vaccine types against influenza A viruses for people aged 50 through 64 was 20 percent (range: -five percent to 39 percent); for those over the age of 65 it was 11 percent (range: -eight percent to 38 percent)

the adjusted influenza vaccine effectiveness for all vaccine types against influenza A viruses for people aged 50 through 64 was 20 percent (range: -five percent to 39 percent); for those over the age of 65 it was 11 percent (range: -eight percent to 38 percent) In 2016/2017,27 the adjusted effectiveness for all vaccine types against influenza A or B viruses for those aged 50 through 64 was 40 percent (range: 24 percent to 53 percent), and those over 65 was 20 percent (range: -11 percent to 43 percent). This despite the fact that the vaccine for the 2016/2017 season was well-matched to the viruses in circulation28

Studies29 30 have also demonstrated that influenza vaccination has no impact on mortality among the elderly. As noted in one such study,31 “Because fewer than 10 percent of all winter deaths were attributable to influenza in any season, we conclude that observational studies substantially overestimate vaccination benefit.”

Research32 published in 2006 analyzed influenza-related mortality among the elderly population over age 65 in Italy, where flu vaccination coverage between 1970 and 2001 had significantly increased. Here too, investigators found no corresponding decline in deaths. According to the authors:

These findings suggest that either the vaccine failed to protect the elderly against mortality (possibly due to immune senescence), and/or the vaccination efforts did not adequately target the frailest elderly. As in the U.S., our study challenges current strategies to best protect the elderly against mortality, warranting the need for better controlled trials with alternative vaccination strategies.

Another 2006 study,33 which followed 72,527 seniors for eight years, showed that, even though seniors vaccinated against influenza had a 44 percent reduced risk of dying during flu season compared to unvaccinated seniors, those who were vaccinated were also 61 percent less like to die before the flu season ever started—a finding attributed to the “healthy user” effect.

According to the authors, “the magnitude of the bias demonstrated by the associations before the influenza season was sufficient to account entirely for the associations observed during influenza season.” In other words, the vaccine played no role whatsoever in reducing the risk of death during flu season.

Research trying to ascertain whether flu vaccination has any impact on hospitalization rates among the elderly has found it difficult to draw any conclusions due to rampant bias. As noted in a 2019 study34 in the journal Vaccine:

… 22 studies were included in the systematic review. Overall, two studies (nine percent) were deemed at moderate risk of bias, thirteen (59 percent) at serious risk of bias and seven (32 percent) at critical risk of bias.

For outpatient visits, we found modest evidence of protection by the influenza vaccine. For all-cause hospitalization outcomes, we found a wide range of results, mostly deemed at serious risk of bias.

The included studies suggested that the vaccine may protect older adults against influenza hospitalizations and cardiovascular events. No article meeting our inclusion criteria explored the use of antibiotics and ILI hospitalizations. The high heterogeneity between studies hindered the aggregation of data into a meta-analysis.

Cell-Based Flu Vaccine No Better Than Egg-Based

The “new and improved” flu shot, Flucelvax—a cell-based35 rather than egg-based vaccine—introduced during the 2017-2018 flu season, has also demonstrated disappointing results. Research by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found it protected just 26.5 percent of those over the age of 65.36

A study37 published September 2019, “Comparison of Vaccine Effectiveness Against Influenza Hospitalization of Cell-Based and Egg-Based Influenza Vaccines, 2017-2018” also concluded that:

For any influenza, the adjusted relative VE [vaccine effectiveness] of cell-based vaccine versus egg-based vaccines was 43 percent for patients ages < 65 years and six percent for patients ages ≥ 65 years.

For influenza A(H3N2), the adjusted relative VE was 61 percent for patients ages < 65 years and four percent for patients ages ≥ 65 years. Statistically significant protection against influenza hospitalization of cell-based vaccine compared to egg-based vaccines was not observed …

Is Flu Vaccine Safe for Pregnant Women?

Historically, pregnant women have been discouraged from taking drugs and vaccines because there’s very little scientific data evaluating risks for the pregnant woman or the growing fetus. Including pregnant women in clinical trials has been considered unethical because there are unknown risks for both mother and child.

For better or worse, that is changing. In 2018, the FDA issued nonbinding recommendations38 for industry detailing when and how pregnant women can be enrolled in clinical trials for drugs and therapies.

Coincidentally, the increased push for women to get flu shots during any trimester in every pregnancy seems to coincide with an amendment to the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act that was included in the 21st Century Cures Act passed by Congress at the end of 2016.

The amendment gives a liability shield to drug companies producing CDC-recommended vaccines for pregnant women so they can’t be sued if a pregnant woman or her child developing in the womb born alive suffers injury from maternal vaccinations.39

As noted by Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center in a public statement given at a hearing September 17, 2018:40

This is a stunning expansion of vaccine product liability protection for the pharmaceutical industry in a 1986 tort reform Act that created a federal compensation program option for children injured by government recommended and mandated vaccines that was never intended to cover adults or be an exclusive remedy.

Despite the lack of safety data when it comes to maternal vaccination,41 the CDC now urges all pregnant women to get vaccinated against the flu. In a 2018 article,42 CNN quotes Dr. Laura E. Riley, professor and chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine, saying “The flu vaccine is safe and effective for both pregnant women and their fetuses” and can be given during any trimester.

A definitive statement like that deserves strong supporting evidence, but not only is safety data for pregnant women sorely lacking, some of the data published in the medical literature suggests maternal vaccination may actually be deeply problematic.

Flu Vaccination Linked to Eightfold Risk of Miscarriage

Importantly, research43 44 funded by the CDC itself linked flu vaccination during early pregnancy to an eightfold risk of miscarriage. In all, 485 pregnant women aged 18 to 44 who had a miscarriage during the flu seasons of 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 were compared to 485 pregnant women who carried to term.

Women who had received an inactivated 2009 pandemic H1N1-containing flu shot the previous year were more likely to suffer miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) within 28 days of receiving another pH1N1-containing flu shot during pregnancy.

While most of the miscarriages occurred during the first trimester, several also took place in the second trimester.45 46 47 The median fetal term at the time of miscarriage was seven weeks.

Of the 485 women who miscarried, 17 had been vaccinated twice in a row—once in the 28 days prior to miscarriage and once in the previous year. For comparison, of the 485 women who had normal pregnancies, only four had been vaccinated two years in a row. CDC adviser for vaccines Amanda Cohn told The Washington Post:48

I think it’s really important for women to understand that this is a possible link, and it is a possible link that needs to be studied and needs to be looked at over more [flu] seasons. We need to understand if it’s the flu vaccine, or is this a group of women [who received flu vaccines] who were also more likely to have miscarriages.

Contradictory Findings Proclaimed ‘Unequivocal’ Evidence

The same researchers have now completed a second study and, this time, they found no link between flu vaccination and miscarriage. A quote by Dr. Edward Belongia, head of the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Population Health at Wisconsin’s Marshfield Clinic, in STAT news reads:49 “For women right now who are wondering if it’s safe to get a vaccine in early pregnancy, we can say unequivocally, ‘Yes, it is safe.'”

The data, presented at a February 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice meeting, has yet to be published so I cannot give any details on the findings as of yet. I’d like to point out the obvious, though.

When the 2017 study came out, detractors were quick to point out that you can’t draw conclusions based on a single study. Yet now, they’re claiming to have “unequivocally” proven safety—based on a single study. In my view, the issue is still wide open for discussion and contemplation. Far more research needs to be done before a claim of safety can be made for women receiving influenza vaccine during pregnancy.

Categorical claims of safety cannot be made for vaccinating infants younger than 6 months against influenza, either.

The 2019 scientific review,50 “Influenza Vaccination: Effectiveness, Indications, and Limits in the Pediatric Population,” published in the journal Frontiers in Pediatrics, points out that “questions and limits about influenza vaccine in pediatric population remain open,” and that “vaccine effectiveness in children is variable and suboptimal, with reported differences according to vaccine types, seasons, and child age.” It also states that “there is no influenza vaccine that directly protects infants <6 months of age.”

Questions Abound About Vaccine Safety for Pregnant Women

In the 2013 article, “Vaccination During Pregnancy: Is it Safe?”51 Loe Fisher lists 10 vaccine facts pertaining to the lack of evidence of safety in pregnant women, including the following:

Drug companies did not test the safety and effectiveness of giving influenza vaccine to pregnant women before the vaccines were licensed in the U.S.52 53 Data on inflammatory and other biological responses to vaccination during pregnancy that could affect pregnancy and birth outcomes are still lacking.54 For example, it’s still unknown whether the influenza vaccine can cause fetal harm or affect your reproductive capacity,55 which is why the vaccine manufacturer product inserts state that the influenza vaccine should be given to a pregnant woman only if it’s “clearly needed.” The biological mechanisms of how maternal vaccination affects the immune and neurological systems of mother and child are not known. Loe Fisher points out, “There are no published biological mechanism studies that assess pre-vaccination health status and measure changes in brain and immune function and chromosomal integrity after vaccination of pregnant women or their babies developing in the womb.” There are very few studies comparing health outcomes between pregnant women and their children who receive the flu vaccine and those who do not.

Flu Vaccine Has Thousands of Vaccine Injury Filings

Importantly, injury following influenza vaccination is the most compensated claim in the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). Between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2017, a total of 3,575 injury claims for flu vaccine were filed, 3,057 of which were compensated.1 Being one of the riskiest vaccines, based on VICP injury filings and awards, is it really wise to proclaim the flu vaccine is safe for all pregnant women at all times?

Influenza vaccine package inserts57 58 59 will also inform you that flu vaccine safety and effectiveness have not been established in pregnant or breastfeeding women. This means there is a lack of scientific evidence demonstrating conclusively that pregnant women will benefit from flu vaccination or that getting vaccinated during pregnancy is, in fact, safe.

If safety and effectiveness have not been scientifically established through methodologically sound and rigorously controlled, replicated studies, the issue is still open for debate, and that’s certainly true when it comes to vaccinating pregnant women.

Sanofi Pasteur’s patient information sheet60 for Fluzone quadrivalent vaccine states that “Sanofi Pasteur Inc. is collecting information on pregnancy outcomes and the health of newborns following vaccination with Fluzone Quadrivalent during pregnancy.”

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also tracks vaccine safety for pregnant women after the fact, while claiming it’s perfectly safe to receive the flu vaccine during pregnancy.61 The sad reality is that pregnant women who are given influenza vaccinations during any trimester during every pregnancy are basically participating in an uncontrolled experiment. They just don’t know it.

Vaccinating During Pregnancy is a Risky Proposition

Aside from the 2017 study linking flu vaccination to miscarriage, research has shown that stimulating a woman’s immune system—which is what vaccination does and must do to stimulate production of antibodies and artificial immunity—during midterm and later-term pregnancy significantly increases the risk that her baby will develop autism62 during childhood, and/or schizophrenia during the teenage years or early adulthood.63

Strong inflammatory responses during pregnancy may also increase the risk of seizures in the baby, and later, as an adult.64 In fact, a number of neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems can occur in babies born to women immunologically stimulated during pregnancy.65 66 67

Overall, given the uncertainty about how flu vaccination affects health in the short and long term, and the absolute unknowns about how it may affect the future health of the baby, it seems as reasonable to avoid vaccination during pregnancy as it is to avoid alcohol, smoking and exposure to other toxins.

As noted by Jeremy R. Hammond in his May 14, 2019, article, “The CDC’s Criminal Recommendation for a Flu Shot During Pregnancy,”68 the CDC relies on retrospective observational studies for its recommendation. The problem with that is that retrospective observational studies are designed to test a hypothesis. They’re not designed to prove or disprove causation and, in fact, cannot do that.

So, a finding of “no association” in an observational study does not mean that a causal relationship is nonexistent. Observational studies also make it difficult for researchers to detect unexpected harms. If they’re not specifically looking for an outcome, it likely will not show in the data.

It’s a rather long and detailed article, but well worth reading. In it, Hammond points out the hypocrisy of relying on observational data for vaccine safety, saying:69

[W]hen Aaron E. Carroll in the New York Times advocated the CDC’s flu shot recommendations, he was telling pregnant women, too, to get vaccinated.

He was, in other words, parroting the CDC’s implicit message that we can trust that observational studies are methodologically robust enough to rule out the possibility, with a high degree of confidence, that vaccination could cause harm to the expectant mother or her child.

Yet just a few months earlier, Carroll had reassured the public that observational studies finding a link between alcohol consumption and cancer aren’t determinative and suggested that more randomized controlled trials are needed to establish what harms and benefits are associated with drinking!

As he advised Times readers in that case, ‘Don’t give too much weight to observational data’ … Why should we forego our skepticism when it comes to the lives and health of entire future generations of children? …

Carroll’s credulous acceptance of the observational studies that the CDC relies upon to support its claims is another good example of the kind of institutionalized cognitive dissonance that exists when it comes to the practice of vaccination. It has become a religion, and we are supposed to believe in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines as a matter of faith …

When it comes to vaccines, we are not supposed to concern ourselves with the methodological weaknesses of the kinds of studies the CDC relies on to support its flu shot recommendation for pregnant women.

We are not supposed to notice that the CDC’s statement that ‘there’s a lot of evidence’ that it’s safe to vaccinate pregnant women also implies that there’s at least some evidence that it is not …

[I]f pharmaceutical companies made the same claims that the CDC makes about the safety of vaccinating pregnant women, they could be sued for fraud.

One of the Most Powerful Videos I’ve Ever Seen

The following video from Barbara Loe Fisher is one of the most powerful videos that I have ever seen. I am hopeful that watching this video will inspire you to take up the cause and join the fight for vaccine freedom and independence.

There is a cultural war and collusion between many industries and federal regulatory agencies that results in a suppression of the truth about vital important health issues. If this suppression continues we will gradually and progressively erode our private individual rights that our ancestors fought so hard to achieve. Please take a few minutes to watch this video:

Flu Shots Rarely Work for People Over Age 65,"Story Highlights Annual flu shots often fail to prevent influenza in the elderly.

Aging immune systems often do not mount robust responses to challenge from natural pathogens or vaccines.

Now high potency influenza vaccines and reactive squalene adjuvants are being added to vaccines for the elderly.

For the 2014-2015 “flu season,” the reported effectiveness of the annual flu shot was only 14% in those over age 50.1

It has been long recognized that elderly people do not respond well to vaccination as a whole and that their immune responses to annual influenza vaccinations are especially weak. The elderly are at higher risk for serious complications from infections like influenza and pneumonia because aging immune systems often do not mount a robust response to challenge from natural pathogens or vaccines.

The number of Americans over age 65 hospitalized for influenza in the 2014-2015 flu season was higher than had been previously reported since government health officials began to collect the data in 2005.2 Regardless of the highly questionable therapeutic value and potentially harmful side effects of the influenza vaccine, public health authorities insist that the annual flu shot is the best defense there is for seniors.

NIH Influenza Vaccine Study Bites Back

It is not a new finding that the flu shot provides little benefit to aging populations. Public health officials have known for many years that analyses of influenza vaccine effectiveness repeatedly reveal the vaccine often does not prevent influenza or influenza complications among the elderly.3 4 [And it is important to remember that the annual flu shot only protects against three to four strains of type A or type B influenza and does not prevent other viral or bacterial infections that cause respiratory symptoms and deaths from “influenza like illness.”]5

Influenza vaccination rates in the 65+ age group rose from approximately 15% in the 1960s to 65% in the 1980s, while mortality from influenza infections among the elderly in response to increasing vaccination rates has continued to climb.3 Unable to accept that the flu vaccine does not protect the elderly, in 2005 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) set out to prove “once and for all” that other factors must be obscuring what they were sure was a significant benefit of the vaccine. The study backfired on them when results confirmed that flu-related death had increased since routine vaccination of older Americans became widespread.4

In that study published in 2006, NIH researchers reported that…

… estimates of vaccine efficacy available from clinical trials suggest that increased influenza vaccination coverage should have substantially reduced influenza-related mortality as measured by excess mortality estimates” (but, that) “Our findings indicate that the mortality benefits of influenza vaccination may be substantially less than previously thought.5

The researchers explained this discrepancy by pointing out:

… the sharp decline in influenza-related deaths among people aged 65 to 74 years in the years immediately after A(H3N2) viruses emerged in the 1968 pandemic was most likely due to the acquisition of natural immunity to these viruses. Because of this strong natural immunization effect, by 1980, relatively few deaths in this age group (about 5000 per year) were left to prevent… together with the flat excess mortality rates after 1980, this suggests that influenza vaccination of persons aged 45 to 74 years provided little or no mortality benefit beyond natural immunization acquired during the first decade of emergence of the A(H3N2) virus.5

In 2006, veteran reporter Sharyl Attkisson interviewed Dr. Tom Reichert, the only government-independent co-author of that study (i.e., the only one allowed to go on record). Dr. Reichert explained they had set out fully expecting their investigation would prove that influenza vaccines helped prevent death from influenza in older adults but that they were, instead, “astonished” to discover this was not the case.6

Health Officials and Vaccine Makers Adding Squalene Adjuvants to Flu Shots for Elderly

In 2009, the FDA licensed influenza vaccines for those over age 65 that contain four times as much antigen as flu vaccines for other age groups in what has turned out to be a failed attempt to hyperstimulate immune responses in the elderly to confer protection.6 7 When that did not do the job, in September 2015 an FDA vaccine advisory committee voted to fast track the licensure of flu vaccines that contain squalene, a controversial oil in water vaccine adjuvant linked with serious reactions that can produce chronic inflammation in the body, including autoimmunity.8 9 10

Other Options for Preventing Influenza in Elderly

Given the evidence that influenza vaccinations have long failed to work for older people, especially those in fragile health living in long-term care facilities or nursing homes, as winter approaches it is useful to look what happens to the aging human immune system and how natural immunity can be strengthened to help vulnerable elderly populations stay healthy during the “flu season.”

The Aging Immune System

There are two ‘branches’ to the immune system:7 8 9 Innate or cell mediated immunity refers broadly to the “first responders” that meet the challenge from an infectious microbe. The innate system response is comprised of several stages, including surface-area physical barriers (skin and mucous membranes), which defend against infectious microbes that enter a cut, for example; inflammatory responses that involve production of white blood cells and specific enzymes; and natural killer cells that search for cells that have undergone changes they recognize as undesirable.

The second branch of the immune system induces humoral or “learned” immunity. It is related to the body’s ability to mount an appropriate antibody response to infection by a specific pathogen and to remember how to defend against that “enemy” in the future.

The workhorses in stimulating inflammatory responses and resolving inflammation to acquire humoral immunity are the “naïve lymphocytes,” essentially blank slates that can respond to any of the host of foreign antigens encountered over the course of a lifetime, and the “memory lymphocytes,” which recognize and respond to antigens they have been exposed to previously.

Several age-related changes, which interact to diminish robust immune responses by the elderly, have been described as “immunosenescence,” a term coined by Dr. Roy Walford. A recognized and highly regarded pioneer in the study of how the body ages,10 Dr. Walford has written about those natural changes.

He explains that, first, the innate cell mediated immune response as we age becomes slower and doesn’t produce as many general-defensive cells. Lung tissues and blood vessels in general become less flexible, so the body can’t as easily effectively deal with challenge from infectious microbes.

But inevitable changes in the learned humoral immune response really tips the balance for older adults. Both the number of naïve lymphocytes being produced and the functionality of the memory lymphocytes begin their gradual decline soon after puberty, but the changes don’t significantly impair functional immunity through most of adult life. According to another expert on the aging immune system, “Only in the late phase of life does the progressive decline of immune function create vulnerability, with a resultant increase in morbidity and mortality due to infection in the elderly.”11

With fewer and more sluggish fighter cells effectively lowering the body’s ability to respond to challenges from both previously encountered and newly encountered microbes, the aging immune system is unable to mount enough of an appropriate inflammatory response and resolve it to achieve either natural or artificial vaccine induced immunity. This means older adults can be at much higher risk of complications from natural infections and vaccination.

That Elusive Influenza Virus

The influenza virus is constantly changing, sometimes rapidly, another reason why the elderly are so vulnerable to serious effects of influenza. Scientists recognize that flu vaccines do not work well against a more virulent influenza A H3N2 strain, which unexpectedly predominated during the 2014-2015 flu season.12

It isn’t hard to understand the pharmaceutical industry’s push for annual flu vaccination for everyone, whether it works or not: There’s a lot of money in the flu vaccine business. And public health officials seem to believe “even a little protection is better than none,” but it’s not like we are talking about a product that is completely free of side effects.

Both inactivated and live virus influenza vaccines are associated with serious adverse reaction reports in the medical literature and in the federally operated vaccine adverse events reporting system (VAERS). The public can search the VAERS database to read descriptions of influenza vaccine reactions here.

Protection Without Vaccination

The influenza virus is a constant presence, but influenza infections and outbreaks are primarily identified in late fall and winter. There are many hypotheses offered to explain why influenza appears to be more prevalent in the colder months, including improved stability of the virus in lower temperatures; reduced blood flow to mucous membranes during colder weather; indoor crowding; increased survival time for the airborne virus in low humidity, and a correlation between dry heated air and viral transmission.13

Many health care providers endorse the use of cool air humidifiers during the flu season, as moisturized air is thought to make it harder for influenza viral particles to circulate and be transmitted. Clinical EFT practitioner and nutritionist Valerie Burke, MSN champions her “fabulous five”: Vitamin D3, probiotics, green tea, elderberry (Sambucus nigra), and Echinacea, all of which have evidence for supporting healthy immune function.14

Influenza infection may not always be avoidable, but taking steps to strengthen our immunity to improve the odds of moving through an influenza infection without experiencing serious complications can help us avoid irrational “fear of flu”—no matter what our age. It is a fear that is encouraged by the pharmaceutical and medical trade industries to persuade us to believe that reliance on the ineffective influenza vaccine is the best way to stay healthy during the flu season, especially for the elderly.

Measles: The New Red Scare,"Fear. It’s a natural and primal human emotion. While human instinct is exceptional in evaluating and reacting to a natural personal risk, as in facing a predator, humans are terrible at assessing modern risks. According to Psychology Today1 this is because our ancestors were programmed to quickly react and respond to a situation before it is even consciously perceived. Our reactions aren’t based in logic and statistics, but in lightning fast primitive responses. Threats such as venomous spiders and snakes2 cause an out-of-proportion fear compared with the more likely threat of being killed in a car crash.3 The low risk of a being killed in a shark attack4 evokes more terror than the much greater chance of dying from a prescription drug.5

(Spider and snake bites kill approximately 13 people a year and shark attacks kill 1 person every 2 years in the United States; there were 32,719 deaths in motor vehicle crashes in 2013 and 38,329 people died from a drug overdose in 2010 in the United States.)

Infectious diseases fall into this emotional fear-based primal mental algorithm. This reaction is completely understandable with mankind’s horrifying historical experience with deadly microbes. The black plague decimated 30-60% of Europe’s total population in the mid-1300s,6 a number of cholera pandemics during the 1800s killed millions,7 typhus killed 3 million in Russia during the early 1900s,8 and the list goes on. Historically, infectious diseases killed massive numbers of people. Typhus, typhoid, cholera, dysentery, smallpox, scarlet fever, whooping cough, diphtheria, tuberculosis, measles, and others were responsible for multimillions of deaths in the Western world over many centuries.

So with the recent spate of measles cases in the United States, the enormous amount of fear and anger comes as no surprise. People who have chosen not to vaccinate for a variety of reasons, have been viciously disparaged,9 there have been calls to jail people that don’t vaccinate,10 many pediatricians are banning parents who don’t vaccinate their kids,11 and laws are quickly being considered to strip people of all rights to refuse any vaccine.12 There has been nothing short of a panic over the relatively small number of cases. It has also incited a raging fear that has been fanned by numerous incendiary media reports. Even comedian Jimmy Kimmel has jumped in, ridiculing anyone that questions vaccines.13

But let’s take a deep breath and a moment to step back from the hysteria and look at some information that is never part of the discussion involving infectious diseases.

Declining Measles Mortality

It’s true that during the 1800s, and even into the early 1900s, measles was a big killer. In fact, all infectious diseases were the leading cause of death—whooping cough, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, and others already mentioned, killed millions. How deadly these diseases were is often emphasized. The implication is that without vaccines, we would return to those dark and deadly times. Massive deadly plagues would all return, and the advances we made because of vaccines would all be wiped out.

However, looking at mortality records, there is something that is never mentioned. The death rate for all infectious diseases had plummeted before the introduction of vaccines for all those diseases. For example, in the United States the mortality rate for measles decreased by more than 98% before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963 (Figure 1). In England, we see the same thing—a dramatic decrease in deaths before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1968 (Figure 2). The same can be said for other infectious diseases such as whooping cough—massive declines in death before the introduction of any vaccine. Scarlet fever, which was during the 1800s a bigger killer than whooping cough or measles, went to near zero without the use of a vaccine.

Before the advent of a measles vaccine, measles was generally considered a mild illness. Even the British Medical Journal remarked in 1959 at this particular medical practice that over a 10 year span there were few complications from measles and that all children recovered.

In the majority of children the whole episode has been well and truly over in a week… In this practice measles is considered as a relatively mild and inevitable childhood ailment that is best encountered any time from 3 to 7 years of age. Over the past 10 years there have been few serious complications at any age, and all children have made complete recoveries. As a result of this reasoning no special attempts have been made at prevention even in young infants in whom the disease has not been found to be especially serious.14

Things were dramatically better before 1963 and the introduction of the first measles vaccine. In fact, if we look at all the causes of death from the United States Vital Statistics in 1962, we see that measles accounted for 0.02% of deaths that year (Figure 3). In 1962, measles was sixth from the bottom for causes of death. You can look through the list of causes of death and find almost everything from “Birth Injuries” at 28,199 to “Ulcers” at 12,228 to “Asthma” at 4,896 were far higher than the 408 deaths attributed to “Measles” that year.

Even if there was never a measles vaccine invented in the first place, would we be experiencing deaths on a massive scale as they were in the 1800s or early 1900s? Not likely. In fact, if we look at the exponential trend line based on 50 years of data, the death rate would have more than likely continued to drop (Figure 4). We can see the same thing in England—the trend shows a decreasing death rate that would have continued after the introduction of the vaccine anyway (Figure 5). It’s not, as you may have believed, that there was death and chaos before the introduction of the measles vaccine and suddenly as if a magic wand was waved we all lived happily ever after. In reality, most of the advances came over many decades of improvement in hygiene, sanitation, electricity, transportation of food, refrigeration, labor laws, and nutrition. The innovation and hard won struggle for all these and other societal improvements were what were instrumental in the mortality decline in all infectious diseases. You owe much more to your plumber, electrician, and grocer for the massive improvements in infectious diseases than any doctor or pharmacist.

Another way to look at the improvements is to see how the case-fatality rate if you caught measles changed over the years (Figure 6). In 1913, if you caught measles you had as high as a 1 in 29 chance of dying. This case-fatality rate improved over the century so that by 1955 you odds had improved to 1 in 1,625. Although the CDC states that the odds of death from measles is 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000, the odds to just before the vaccine introduction vary from the low of 1 in 1,625 in 1955 to a high of 1 in 980 in 1961, with an actual average of about 1 in 1,215 in the 10 year years before the vaccine was introduced in 1963.

That doesn’t mean there weren’t deaths because of measles in 1962. There were, but they were very rare. For instance, in the six New England States (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) there were just 16 deaths attributed to measles. Some states had zero that year. It just wasn’t as huge of a problem as you might think today with all the rage and panic.

Back in 1962, we didn’t have the detailed statistics on causes of death that we have today. The National Safety Council now accumulates causes of death from being struck by lightning to falling out of a building to drowning. If we compare the 1962 odds of dying from measles (1 in 457,000), it falls between drowning in a swimming pool (1 in 486,000) and a fall involving a bed, chair, or other furniture (1 in 424,000); we can gain a little perspective on the risk if we had no measles vaccine program at all (Figure 7).

As with other Western countries, the mortality rate from measles had greatly declined in France before the vaccine became available in 1966 (Figure 8). Yet, after its introduction vaccination rates remained low. In 1983 the vaccination rate was less than 20%.15 In that year there were 20 deaths attributed to measles out of a population of over 54 million, which is a rate of 0.037 per 100,000 or approximately 1 in 2.7 million.

By 1989 the vaccination rate was still less than 40%.16 In that year, there were 3 deaths attributed to measles, which is a rate of .005 per 100,000 or 1 in 19.37 million (Figure 9). Again, to put this in perspective by comparing it to National Safety Council statistics, you were more than 3 times as likely to be killed by being hit by lightning (1 in 5,506,120) than dying from measles in France in 1989 (1 in 19,370,000) when the vaccination rate was well below what would be considered as sufficient for “herd immunity.”

Majorities are never a proof of the truth.

– Dr. Walter R. Hadwen, 1896

Vaccination vs. Natural Infection

Also, the less than perfect history of the measles vaccine is never mentioned. The first measles vaccine, which was a killed measles virus (KMV) vaccine introduced in 1963, caused serious problems17 and even deaths.18 After millions of children were injected with it, the vaccine was quickly but quietly scrapped and a live vaccine was introduced in 1967 with proclamations made that a single shot would give lifelong immunity.19 A grandiose and unproven proclamation was made that measles would be eliminated from the United States by 1967.20 Today, all children have to receive 2 doses of the vaccine. Additional shots are recommended to adults by the CDC.21

Contracting natural measles generally gave you solid lifelong immunity/22 The vaccine doesn’t and will require revaccination throughout life. Because of this artificially generated situation, we could see large scale epidemics due to less than perfect immunity from the vaccine:

Because measles-specific antibody titer after vaccination is lower than after natural infection, there is concern that vaccinated persons may gradually lose protection from measles. Secondary vaccine failure (loss of immunity over time), in contrast to primary vaccine failure (no protection immediately after vaccination), is a concern because of the potential insidious challenge to measles elimination. For instance, if vaccine-induced immunity wane to nonprotective levels in a high proportion of vaccinated adults, the level of population protection might decline to allow recurrence of endemic disease. By means of statistical modeling, Mossong et al. predicted waning of vaccine-induced immunity 25 years after immunization.23

Could we have done something different than vaccinating every human being on the planet multiple times against a relatively mild infectious disease? Was there another path we could have taken in the 1960s? The truth is that there was never a serious study of why there was such a massive decline in deaths before the vaccine. Once there was a vaccine, virtually everyone jumped onto the bandwagon promoting and creating laws to enforce this paradigm. But in 1967, scientists knew that antibodies (the thing that measles vaccine stimulates and which is measured as a mark of immunity) weren’t even needed for normal recovery from measles.24 Experiments done in the 1940s showed that vitamin C was extremely effective against measles, especially when used in higher doses.25 Vitamin A also led to a dramatic decline in measles mortality:

Combined analyses showed that massive doses of vitamin A given to patients hospitalized with measles were associated with an approximately 60% reduction in the risk of death overall, and with an approximate 90% reduction among infants…. Administration of vitamin A to children who developed pneumonia before or during hospital stay reduced mortality by about 70% compared with control children.26

Trading Places: Lower Disease Incidence vs. Weaker Immunity

Although the mortality rate had decreased over time to very low levels, the incidence of the disease had only slowly declined by 1963. After the introduction of the vaccine, there is a precipitous decline in cases of recorded measles (Figure 10). Some of this decline in incidence is because of how diseases are measured. If you had gotten a vaccine and actually did worse than if you caught natural measles by having a higher fever or atypical measles, you were still counted as not having measles. With the KMV vaccine, forty-eight percent of people had a rash, and 83 percent had fevers up to 106°F post-injection.27 Yet with the measles vaccine, there was an interruption of viral transmission which reduced wild measles to the very low levels we see today. So the vaccine ultimately did what it was designed to do—reduce the cases of wild measles—even if it took a lot longer and many mistakes along the way to do it.

Today, the vaccine is not risk-free. How much risk is carried with it? It’s hard to tell because the only tracking of problems is done through a completely voluntary reporting system called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Even the FDA states it receives less than 1% of suspected serious adverse drug reactions.28 This means only a small fraction of the events that happen are actually reported. Even so, you can still search the VAERS database29 and quickly discover deaths or other serious problems that are associated with vaccines (Figure 11).

The odds of death are probably low from the vaccine, but then again, so is a death from measles itself. So we’re trying to prevent a relatively low-risk disease that provides stronger immunity with a vaccine that has a low risk of causing problems. Because of this weaker vaccine immunity, there will be calls for vaccinating more and more adults for measles when in the past it was rare for anyone to get measles except as a child. Also keep in mind that maternal antibodies of the vaccinated that are passed to a baby are far weaker than those of people who attained natural immunity.30 Because of this, babies are now more vulnerable to measles when in the past they would have been protected by stronger maternal antibodies. Now there are considerations for giving the MMR to children at a younger age or their mothers in an attempt to correct this unexpected problem.31 And these issues are just part of the story.

In the 1950s, it was also observed that mothers often commented on “how much good the attack (of measles) has done their children.”32 We’re learning today that exposure to microbes is beneficial because it actually stimulates the immune system, reducing allergies and asthma.33 Was measles a benefit for those who were well nourished? Could we have taken on an approach of evaluating and ensuring the health of children to help them attain lifelong protection from measles while boosting their immune systems? Was this an approach that would not only have benefited children in dealing with measles but simultaneously with other infectious diseases and other health conditions?

In fact there is research showing just that: measles infection had a whole host of positive immune modulating effects that have been shown to be beneficial to people:

There was evidence of association between a negative history of measles, exposure in early life, and development of immunoreactive diseases, sebaceous skin diseases, degenerative diseases of bone and cartilage, and certain tumours.34

A reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease was associated with most childhood viral infections. The negative association was statistically significant for a history of measles prior to college entrance.35

Our results pointed out a protective role of childhood infectious diseases on the risk of CLL [chronic lymphoid leukaemia] in adults.36

Measles and mumps, especially in case of both infections, were associated with lower risks of mortality from atherosclerotic CVD [Cardiovascular Disease].37

In the 1970s, measles infections were observed to cause regression of pre-existing cancer tumors in children.38

So were the mothers of the 1950s right that an attack of measles had provided their children a benefit? Did the perhaps laudable goal of eliminating measles result in a number of unanticipated increases of other more serious diseases? It certainly appears that by vaccinating with the idea of protecting against measles scientists have been modifying the immune system without fully comprehending what they have been doing and with very few understanding the immunologic blowback.

The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

– Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933

Fear as a Pretext for Infringing on Individual Rights

Is it really so clear-cut that the CDC and WHO should insist on vaccinating everyone in the United States for measles? Is it reasonable to have politicians who generally don’t understand any of this and who defer to people who have an extreme pro-vaccine bias to make decisions to force everyone to follow a set plan? Keep in mind the CDC states that before the vaccine there were 500 deaths a year from measles39 and 1-2 children out of a 1,000 (or 1 in 500) will die from the disease.40 Yet, the actual numbers are a little different than what you see presented. Looking at the data from 5 years before the vaccine, the average number of deaths was 440, not 500. And there is every probability that this number would have continued to decline. The chances of dying if you caught the disease using the same 5 years before the vaccine had an average of 1 in 1,157 not 1 in 500 or even 1 in 1,000. And the odds may have been even better. Some have suggested that the chances of dying from measles were at a much lower rate of 1 to 3 in 10,000.41

In the 1920s, the United States was gripped by a Red Scare.42 President Wilson’s Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer conducted a series of raids on individuals he believed were dangerous to American security. He deported immigrants without just cause. Federal agents broke into the homes of suspected anarchists without search warrants, jailed labor leaders, and held about 5,000 citizens without respecting their right to legal counsel. Palmer thought that American civil liberties were less important than rooting out potential wrongdoers.

Today, we’re in the midst of a new red scare in the form of fear of a red measles rash where there are large numbers of people that think that freedom and self determination is less important than being vaccinated. This red scare has led people to propose mandating all vaccines for everyone without exception. Proposals have been made to legally sue those who don’t vaccinate and are blamed for infecting someone else.43 Ironically, those who are harmed by a vaccine are actually prevented by law from directly suing the vaccine manufacturer.44

How long before this hysteria results in parents having their children taken away by the state? Or actually throwing parents in jail for trying to do what’s best for themselves and their children? Do we want to create a society of totalitarian medical rule where you don’t have a choice in anything that is dictated to you by the government and pharmaceutical companies? In the early 1900s, compulsory vaccination laws were used as a justification for forced sterilization of the unfit based on a later-discredited science of eugenics.45 Tens of thousands of people were forcibly sterilized in the United States, all based on this notion that the State has supreme rights to compel you to get vaccinated.

Shouldn’t we be putting our efforts into things that are far more dangerous than measles? Every year in the United States nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) kill 16,500 people through gastrointestinal complications alone.46 Secondhand smoke kills 42,000 nonsmokers.47 Hospital-acquired pressure sores kill 60,000 people.48 Hospital-acquired infections kill 100,000 people,49 and one study estimates there are as many as 400,000 premature deaths from preventable medical harms associated with hospital care.50 The odds of dying because of medical harm associated with hospital care is 1 in 790—a far cry from the 1962 chance of dying from measles at 1 in 457,000. And ironically those pediatric offices where you’re getting your vaccine to protect your healthy child from measles was recently reported at causing 700,000 flu-like illnesses each year in children and family members within two weeks of the visit.51 That is higher than the approximately 500,000 measles cases that occurred in 1962.

No one is saying that measles wasn’t and isn’t a problem. But put into logical perspective, it’s not something we need to panic over and allow laws to be put in place that strip us all of our human rights to control our own bodies. As a society, we’re far more worried about shark attacks and measles than looking behind the illusions that have led to the deaths of so many more.

Is any of this ever discussed by any of the talking-heads on CNN? Is there an outcry to jail medical professionals for causing so many preventable hospital-acquired harms? Where is the mobilization to stop the 700,000 cases of flu-like illness happening because of pediatric offices? Is Jimmy Kimmel talking about hospitals and how many people die each year because of an infection they acquired in that hospital? No, no, no, and no. Why? Because in large part, many humans react with a primitive fear response instead of objectively looking at facts, examining history, and questioning what they’ve been told.

Four Potential Consequences of Wearing Face Masks We Need to Be...,"Opinion | If healthcare workers wear surgical masks, there is good evidence that it limits the spread of respiratory viral infections in hospitals. But there is no clear evidence that surgical masks protect members of the public from getting or passing on these sorts of infections—most likely because of incorrect use. For cloth masks worn by the public, the picture is even murkier.

Surgical masks are made up of several layers of non-woven plastic and can effectively filter very small particles, such as droplets of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). The masks typically contain an external waterproof layer and an internal absorbent layer.

Although masks made from scarves, T-shirts or other fabrics can’t provide the same level of protection and durability as surgical masks, they can block some of the large droplets exhaled by the wearer, hence protecting others from viral exposure. But their ability to filter droplets depends on their construction. Multi-layered cloth masks are better at filtering but harder to breathe through. And they become wetter quicker than single-layer masks.

The question we need to ask is not so much whether cloth masks offer as good a protection as surgical masks (we know that they don’t, and perhaps that’s fine), but whether there are serious unintended consequences of recommending their widespread use by members of the public.

When deciding if a safety measure is worth introducing at scale, it’s important to balance any benefits against potential harms. Here are four potential consequences that, unless mitigated against, could make things worse. Forewarned is forearmed.

The Big Four

First, what’s become known as the Peltzman effect suggests that introducing one safety measure, such as car seatbelts, may lead to other, compensatory risk behaviours, such as speeding. (If you perceive that your car is safer than usual, you might compensate for this by driving faster.) In the context of COVID-19, it has been argued that the wearing of a mask may make people feel safer, and hence minimise other protective behaviours which we know to be effective, such as social distancing and regular hand washing.

Although we don’t have clear evidence that this is happening during the pandemic, a few studies conducted before the outbreak found that people did indeed have worse hand hygiene when wearing a mask.

Second, to offer any protection, masks need to be worn correctly and consistently when in contact with other people. Most studies conducted so far—none of which were conducted during the current pandemic—didn’t explicitly look at the level of adherence to mask-wearing. Those that did reported variable adherence, ranging from “good” to “poor”.

It’s important to note, though, that the more severe a disease seems and the more susceptible people feel, the more likely they are to protect themselves during a pandemic. Given the high number of global infections and deaths, people may display greater than typical levels of adherence to mask-wearing during the pandemic.

Third, masks may act as an extra transmission route or prompt other behaviour that transmits the virus, such as regular face touching. To stop masks being turned into alternative transmission routes, they need to be safely put on and taken off.

People touch their faces 15-23 times per hour on average—an itchy or poorly fitted mask may mean that people touch their eyes, nose and mouth even more regularly. After touching your mask, there’s a risk that your hands become contaminated, with the risk that you will then spread the virus to other surfaces, such as door handles, railings or tables.

Fourth, U.K. researchers have calculated that if the entire U.K. population started using disposable masks daily, it would create a significant environmental hazard, namely 42,000 tonnes of potentially contaminated and unrecyclable plastic waste per year.

Also, most people will have noticed the increased littering of masks in community spaces, which may act as environmental and infection hazards. Reusable rather than disposable masks are therefore preferable.

National and international public health bodies now recommend that members of the public use masks in places where it’s difficult to maintain social distancing, such as on public transport. We strongly urge readers to carry on with good hand hygiene and social distancing, not touching their face and using reusable (rather than disposable) face coverings—and safely disposing of them at the end of their useful life.

Mortality Rate for COVID-19 May Be Closer to Influenza,"At a press briefing on Mar. 3, 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, said, “Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported COVID-19 cases have died.” On Mar. 13, The New York Times reported that modeling experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were estimating that if no actions are taken to stop the spread of coronavirus in the U.S., worst-case scenario, “between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected over the course of the epidemic” and “as many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die.”1 2 3 4 5

The 3.4 percent mortality rate for COVID-19 and the worst-case scenario predictions by the CDC are in marked contrast to earlier estimates that had placed the mortality rate at around 2.3 percent,6 a figure that was reached by dividing the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases of the disease (rather than the number of actual cases of COVID-19, which is unknown).7

Other infectious disease experts disagree with the WHO’s often quoted 3.4 percent mortality rate, maintaining that it is much lower. Instead of COVID-19 being more 30 times deadly than the annual influenza virus, which has an estimated mortality rate of 0.1 percent, U.S. health officials such as Anthony Fauci, MD of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) believe the mortality rate is closer to one percent, or about 10 times more fatal than seasonal influenza.8

The WHO figure does not take into account asymptomatic COVID-19 cases or cases in which symptoms are minimal, said Dr. Fauci.9 In other words, there are many mild cases of COVID-19 that are not being diagnosed, reported and counted because many of those people are not going to the hospital and are not being tested, diagnosed and reported. So it is difficult to come up with a reasonable estimate for just how lethal COVID-19 really is compared to other infections.5

A one percent mortality rate for an infectious disease is still high. However, even that estimate is based on extremely limited data, given that very few people in the U.S.—and in many other countries—have been tested for COVID-19. There also have been problems with the accuracy of lab tests for the virus. “We’re very concerned about false positives, just as damning as false negatives” said Bruce Carlson of medical diagnostic market research firm Kalorama Information in New York.10 11 12 13 14 15

Chief medical officer and epidemiologist Professor Chris Whitty thinks the mortality rate for COVID-19 may end up being less than one percent.5 “I am reasonably confident one percent is the upper rate of mortality,” Prof. Whitty said.16

Prof. Whitty’s prediction is consistent with current estimated mortality rates for COVID-19 in countries like South Korea and Germany. In South Korea, the rate has been pegged at 0.6 percent. In Germany, the rate is 0.2 percent, which is particularly interesting since that country has the highest median age in all of Europe and, thus, potentially could be the most vulnerable to the severest impact of the disease.17 18 19

Germany’s rate of 0.2 percent is consistent with the COVID-19 mortality rate around the world, excluding China. Microbiologist Lothar Wieler, PhD, president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Germany, believes that, ultimately, the rate in China will settle at about 0.2 percent as well. A study released by China’s Center for Disease Control in February estimated the mortality rate of the disease in China, excluding Hubei province, where the city of Wuhan is located, had already dropped to 0.4 percent.18 20

In Wuhan, reportedly the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, the mortality rate of the disease is now down to 1.4 percent based on a recent estimate by infectious disease researchers Joseph Wu, PhD and Kathy Leung, PhD of the University of Hong Kong. However, that estimate may be high, according to epidemiologist Jeffrey Shaman, PhD of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.21

“I think there are many more than the [approximately] 70,000″ confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hubei, said Dr. Shaman. If so, the higher number of cases would skew the mortality rate for the disease downward.21

Like other infectious disease experts, Dr. Wieler believes the impact of COVID-19 may ultimately prove to be similar to that of a severe outbreak of influenza.18

Coronavirus May Be Spread by Money Says WHO,"The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Mar. 2, 2020 that dirty banknotes may be spreading the COVID-19 coronavirus because the virus can survive on surfaces for several days, according to the British newspaper The Telegraph.1

“Yes, it’s possible,” said a WHO spokesperson. “We know that money changes hands frequently and can pick up all sorts of bacteria and viruses and things like that. We would advise people to wash their hands after handling banknotes, and avoid touching their face. When possible it’s a good idea to use contactless payments.”1

Paper Currency in China Being Disinfected or Destroyed

The comments coincide with actions being taken by authorities in China to contain the spread of the coronavirus by cleaning or destroying paper currency in certain regions of the country. On Feb. 26, 2020, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) branch in Guangzhou, China ordered commercial banks in the southern province of Guangdong to disinfect and store banknotes in dry areas for a period of at least two weeks before returning them to circulation.2

PBOC Guangzhou also said it would destroy all paper currency collected by hospitals, buses and wet markets where dead and live seafood and animals, including wildlife, are sold in the open.2

The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) in February also advised Chinese banks to increase the number of times they disinfect areas frequently used by customers, including counters, appliances and password entry devices.3

Coronaviruses Can Remain Infectious on Surfaces for Days

An analysis of 22 studies published in The Journal of Hospital Infection involving human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can remain infectious on inanimate surface for up to nine days at room temperature.1 4

“Like any other surface that large numbers of people come into contact with, notes can carry bacteria or viruses, said a spokesperson for the Bank of England. “However, the risk posed by handling a polymer note is no greater than touching any other common surface, such as handrails, doorknobs or credit cards.”1

The review of the literature in The Journal of Hospital Infection noted that surfaces infected with coronaviruses can be disinfected within one minute using a solution consisting of 62–71 percent ethanol and 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide or 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite.4

Doctors Avoid Hand Washing Despite Evidence It is Best Way to...,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been urging everyone to thoroughly and frequently wash their hands since reports of the coronavirus outbreak in China, highlighting the long recognized practice of hand washing as a tried and true infection control measure.1 A little known fact is that among all health care providers, physicians are known to be the most reluctant to wash their hands while caring for patients.2

Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis first observed in 1846 that when physicians washed their hands between working with cadavers and assisting at births, death rates plummeted. His findings were met with great skepticism by doctors at the time, who were angry at being blamed for patients dying. After Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister published their findings about the need to maintain antiseptic conditions during surgery, the benefits of good hand hygiene to prevent transmission of infection slowly became universally accepted. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that even in resource-rich settings, hand washing compliance can be as low as zero percent, with compliance levels most frequently well below 40 percent.3

Healthcare-Acquired Infections Associated With Poor Hand Hygiene

Hand carriage of resistant pathogens has repeatedly been shown to be associated with healthcare-associated infections (HAI).4 Microbes that can be spread on the hands of health-care staff can include Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Strep), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Clostridium difficile, Candida, Rotavirus, Adenovirus, Hepatitis A virus, and Norovirus.

Good hand hygiene is the single most important, simplest, and least expensive means of reducing the prevalence of infections acquired in healthcare settings. Healthcare-associated infections prolong recovery time and hospital stays, result in disability, increase medical costs, and pose life-threatening risks for patients.

The CDC reports that on any given day, about one in 31 hospital patients has at least one HAI. In 2015 there were an estimated 687,000 HAIs in U.S. acute care hospitals and 72,000 patients died from infections acquired during their hospitalizations.5 Up to 56 percent of neonatal deaths among babies born in hospitals are due to infections.6

Although HAI is the most frequently reported adverse event in health care, its true global burden remains unknown because of the difficulty in gathering reliable data.7 A 2013 study estimated that the total costs for five major infections acquired in health care settings in the U.S. were $9.8 billion.

Physicians Wash Hands Less Than Other Health Care Providers

Hand washing has been recognized as so critical to infection control and good patient care that it is included in the American Medical Association’s (AMA) Code of Medical Ethics. While Section 8.7 “Routine Universal Immunization of Physicians” allows for physicians to exempt from vaccination due to medical, religious, or philosophic reasons, they are not exempt from hand washing: “Conscientious participation in routine infection control practices, such as hand washing and respiratory precautions, is a basic expectation of the profession.”8

Despite this, studies9 10 11 12 13 have documented the reluctance of physicians, more than other health care providers, to wash their hands while caring for patients, and physician adherence to hand hygiene remains low in most hospitals.14

Why don’t physicians wash their hands?

While there are technical explanations, human factors such as social norms, perceived risk, role models, perceived knowledge, and motivation, play a role.15 One study discovered that self-protection, i.e. physicians engage in hand washing to protect themselves from acquiring infections rather than to ensure patient safety, is more important for physician compliance, and that some physicians believe there is a lack of evidence that hand washing is effective in preventing cross-infection.16

Barriers to good hand hygiene

Staff hierarchy also appears to affect hand hygiene compliance in healthcare settings, including status (physician compliance is worse than nurses), being male, lack of role models among colleagues or superiors, and forgetfulness.

Clinical factors include working in an intensive care unit, working during the week (weekend compliance was better), being involved in activities with high risk of cross contamination, understaffing/overcrowding/insufficient time, patient needs taking priority, and feeling that hand hygiene interfered with the worker-patient relationship.

Environmental and behavioral factors include the belief that wearing gowns or gloves obviates the need for hand hygiene, hand washing causing skin irritation or dryness, inconveniently placed sinks and lack of soap and paper towels, lack of knowledge of protocols, skepticism regarding the value of hand hygiene, disagreement with the recommendations, and lack of institutional priority/sanctions for non-compliers.17

According to Erin DuPree, MD, chief medical officer and vice president with the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare, the failure of many healthcare workers to practice proper hand hygiene techniques “is a complex problem that isn’t easy to solve. A simple slogan or campaign isn’t enough, nor is demanding that healthcare workers try harder. Comprehensive, systematic and sustainable change is the only solution to the problem.”18

Good hand hygiene reduces infections and costs

A WHO report on the evidence of hand hygiene on transmission of multi-drug resistant infections in healthcare settings cites a study that showed that when hand hygiene compliance increased from poor (<60 percent) to excellent (90 percent), each level of improvement was associated with a 24 percent reduction in the risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquisition.19

One 2016 study at the University of North Carolina Hospitals found that during a 17-month study period following a hand hygiene program that resulted in a ten percent improvement in hand hygiene, they reported six percent fewer HAIs and 197 fewer infections, 22 fewer deaths and an overall savings of $5 million.20

In a paper published in 2015 in the Journal of Infection and Drug Resistance, author Mary-Louise McLaws notes that the relationship between hand hygiene and HAI is complicated by such things as implementation of concurrent interventions, measurement error, and surveillance bias, and is therefore “complicated”.21

New vaccines coming for healthcare associated infections

Current vaccines licensed by the FDA are available for adenovirus (given to U.S. soldiers), rotovirus and hepatitis A, infections that can be transmitted in healthcare settings. Pfizer pulled the plug on its new Staphylococcus aureus vaccine candidate after it failed a phase 2b trial in December 2018. However, a university collaborative announced in November 2019 that they had successfully used a biofilm-specific vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus infection in mice and rabbits.22 Pfizer is advancing a vaccine against Clostridium difficile, and Vaxart, a small San Francisco vaccine biotech, has completed phase 1b studies on a norovirus vaccine and are ready to begin phase 2b.23

The Washington University School of Medicine and the biotech startup VaxNewMo has developed a glycoconjugate vaccine candidate for Klebsiella that may have potential for progression to early stage clinical trials. Several anti-candida vaccines have been tested in clinical trials, although there is still no vaccine available.24

"Biggest Anti-Lockdown Freedom Day Protest Held in Berlin, Germany","While public health officials at the World Health Organization (WHO) and in other countries argue about whether the new SARS CoV-2 virus is causing a “second wave” of infections in countries that are easing lockdown measures or the world is simply experiencing “one big wave of transmission,” since late July Germany and other European countries have been reporting increases in COVID-19 cases and deaths.1 2 As governments discuss whether to re-institute regulations enforcing lockdowns, the people of Germany made their voices heard on Aug. 1, 2020 in Berlin in the biggest anti-coronavirus lockdown, anti-masking protest yet held anywhere in the world.

Declared by event organizers as “Day of Freedom—The End of the Pandemic,” mainstream media outlets like the Associated Press and Reuters estimated that the peaceful demonstration drew a crowd of 20,000 people. However, first-hand social media reports estimated hundreds of thousands of people—perhaps over one million—marched from the Brandenburg Gate, which is near the Reichstag building housing the German parliament, and then rallied on a boulevard in the city’s large Tiergarten park.

According to one Reuters report:

Protesters danced and sang, “We are free people!” to the tune of rock band Queen’s ‘We Will Rock You.’ Others marched with placards saying, ‘We are making noise because you are stealing our freedom!’ and ‘Do think! Don’t wear a mask!’ “Our demand is to return to democracy,” said one protester who declined to give his name. “The mask that enslaves us must go.’”3

‘We Are the Second Wave”

According to Associated Press, protesters came from across Germany and held signs that said: “We are being forced to wear a muzzle,” “Natural defense instead of vaccination” and “We are the second wave.”

AP reported that when police using bullhorns warned those marching in the streets to wear masks and adhere to social distancing rules and were ignored, a criminal complaint against the rally’s organizer was drawn up for “failing to enforce hygiene rules” and protesters moved to the Tiergarten park to continue the rally before being dispersed without incident.4

Populists and Right Wing Conspiracy Theorists?

The Irish Times noted that, “Germany’s management of the pandemic has widely been viewed as relatively successful, with a lower death rate than comparable countries. The country has been easing lockdown measures since late April but social-distancing rules remain in place, as does a requirement to wear masks in public transport and shops.”5 The U.K. newspaper compared Germany’s death toll—“just over 9,150 people out of more than 210,670 confirmed virus cases”—as being “five times less than Britain’s, which has a smaller population.”

Although the large numbers of people who traveled to Berlin to march against the government’s lockdown and masking requirements came from big cities and small towns all over Germany, most big media companies described them as “conspiracy theorists” and “right wing populists.”6

A co-leader of the Social Democrats, the junior party in Germany’s governing coalition, was quoted by the Associated Press angrily criticizing the protestors, alleging “They are not just endangering our health, they are endangering our success against the pandemic and for the revival of the economy, education and society. Irresponsible!”7

Reuter’s quoted a protestor, who countered that:

Only a few scientists around the world who follow the government’s lead are heard. Those who hold different views are silenced, censored or discredited as defenders of conspiracy theories.8

Sweden’s Stands By “No Lockdown” Policy

Unlike the U.S. and most European countries, which instituted strict universal social lockdown measures, Sweden’s public health agency refused to order a country-wide lockdown this year.9 Instead, public health officials allowed a controlled natural spread of the new coronavirus so the population could develop “herd immunity.” Voluntary social distancing measures were instituted to allow the country to continue to operate economically and socially without closing offices, restaurants, primary schools, recreational facilities and other parts of society.

At the end of July, European countries that had implemented strict lockdowns during 2020 started reporting a “second wave” of SARS CoV-2 infections accompanied by mortality increases, including Belgium, Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain and the U.K. However, new infections in Sweden have been steadily declining. Newsweek reported that:10

Amid fears over a potential second wave of novel coronavirus across Europe, new infections in Sweden, where full lockdown measures were not implemented, have mostly declined since late June.

Even though Sweden currently ranks eighth among countries with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people—higher than the U.S. and Brazil, which are number one and two in terms of numbers of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people—Sweden’s chief epidemiologist Dr. Anders Tegnell said, “We are now seeing rapidly falling cases, we have continuously had healthcare that has been working, there have been free beds at any given time, never any crowding in the hospitals.”

Tegnell told Newsweek that failure to manage deaths among the elderly living in long term care facilities at the beginning of the outbreak contributed to Sweden’s high death toll, and changes have been made to control outbreaks in those facilities.

"Federal Bill Proposes COVID–19 Testing, Tracing and Quarantine of...","July 4, 2020 marks the 244th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. With much of the country still shut down, large gatherings banned and “non-essential” businesses closed with required masking indoors and outdoors in some states, it is hard to imagine firework displays, neighborhood barbeques and other annual Independence Day traditions being held.

A new bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives several months ago is another example of attempts to restrict and even eliminate civil liberties that are described in the Declaration of Independence and outlined in the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution. Under the guise of “protecting” Americans from being infected with COVID-19, Representative Bobby Rush (D-IL) introduced H.B. 6666 in the Committee on Energy and Commerce on May 1, 2020 to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), to award federal grants to states, non-governmental organizations and other eligible entities to conduct COVID–19 diagnostic testing on Americans, including in their homes, and quarantine them in their homes or elsewhere, if necessary,

The bill authorizes the allocation of 100 billion dollars of federal funds this year and unlimited amounts in future years to create a massive national electronic surveillance, testing, tracing and quarantine enforcement system. The funds will be used by states and other approved organizations and entities to hire “contact tracers,” who will test, trace and monitor the contacts of individuals testing positive for COVID-19. Mobile health units will be used to test Americans in their homes, if necessary.

Entities eligible to receive federal funding include federally qualified health centers, school-based health clinics, disproportionate share hospitals, academic medical centers, nonprofit organizations, universities and other educational institutions,, high schools, and any other type of authorized entity as determined by the HHS Secretary. Priority will be given to applicants in COVID-19 “hot spots,” medically underserviced communities and to entities that hire residents of the community it serves. The federal funds can be used to hire, train, compensate, and pay the expenses of those doing the testing and monitoring of Americans and to purchase personal protective equipment and other supplies.

H.R. 6666 was touted as a bipartisan effort, however the one Republican co-sponsor, Rep. Van Drew, Jefferson (R-NJ) withdrew his support.

According to a press release from the bill’s sponsor, Congressman Rush:

Reopening our economy and getting back to normal will be all but impossible if we do not step up our testing efforts and implement robust and widespread contact tracing. Until we have a vaccine to defeat this dreaded disease, contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this.

The Bill of Rights Cannot Be Suspended During A “Public Health Crisis”

H.R. 6666 would provide federal grants to entities whose primary purpose would be to trace, monitor, test, and support the quarantine of healthy people who may have come into contact with COVID-19 positive individuals. Tracking down, testing and supporting the involuntary confinement of healthy people in their homes is a violation of privacy and other civil liberties set forth in the Bill of Rights, the first 10 Amendments to the U.S. Constitution designed to protect individual liberty and limit the power of the government.1 2

The U.S. Constitution is the “Supreme law of the land” and the Bill of Rights cannot be set aside by federal or state governments during pandemics or other public health emergencies.3

This fact was acknowledged by the U.S. government in The United States Statement of Interest in Support of Plaintiffs filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a case4 last month in which members of a church attending a drive-in sermon were issued citations for violating an executive order5 in Mississippi. The DOJ stated;

There is no pandemic exception, however, to the fundamental liberties the Constitution safeguards. Indeed, “individual rights secured by the Constitution do not disappear during a public health crisis.” In re Abbott, — F.3d —, 2020 WL 1685929, at *6 (5th Cir. Apr. 7, 2020). These individual rights, including the protections in the Bill of Rights made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, are always in force and restrain government action.6 (emphasis added)

H.R. 6666 appears to violate the 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th Amendments of the Constitution by providing government funding to government and private entities for the creation and implementation of programs that would trace, test, monitor and support the potential involuntary quarantine of healthy people who may have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected person, whether or not they are exhibiting symptoms or may be immune to the virus without the consent of those being detained.

The bill may violate the 4th Amendment right of American citizens to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.7 H.R. 6666 does not appear to preserve a citizen’s right to be safe in their home free from warrantless government intrusion and monitoring, nor does it provide for the voluntary undertaking of medical testing. The bill also does not set forth how the contacts of persons with COVID-19 will be traced and whether the Constitutional rights of those infected with COVID-19, as well as their contacts, will be upheld.

The bill may violate the 5th Amendment, which guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.8 It appears that under the proposed law, quarantined healthy citizens could be denied the right to work, travel or otherwise go about their business without due process of the law.

H.R. 6666 may also violate the 8th Amendment prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment.9 Monitoring healthy people and requiring them to stay home, restricting their right to work and travel, for what would likely be a fourteen (14) day quarantine because they or their mobile phone was in the same area as a COVID-19 positive person, could be deemed cruel and unusual punishment.

Finally, the proposed legislation bill appears to violate the 9th Amendment, which bestows upon the people all of the rights not specifically set forth in the Constitution.10 It provides federal funding for entities to create and implement undefined “related activities” to COVID-19 testing and unnamed “other purposes.” Because H.R. 6666 is so broadly written and has no pre-set end date, there is simply no way to know what and how many inalienable rights may be infringed upon or taken away from citizens in violation of the U.S. Constitution.

H.R. 6666 Creates A Slippery Slope

The federal funding of entities to develop and implement a surveillance operation that would force the testing and tracking of healthy individuals creates slippery slope that threatens civil liberties and violations of fundamental rights essential to our constitutional republic, in which legislators elected by a majority are supposed to pass laws that equally protect the constitutional rights of all citizens, the majority and minority alike.

H.R. 6666 lacks the safeguards and conditions necessary to ensure that surveillance operations and data collections would not be used by local, state and federal governments and private businesses to force the involuntary testing, monitoring and quarantining of healthy people or for other undisclosed purposes.

This unconstrained display of federal power could lead to the removal of civil liberties, such as the right to appear in public spaces and travel; the right to employment and education; the right to participate in government-funded services, and the right to receive care in a government funded hospital or other medical facility.

Representative Rush stated that under this bill, testing would be voluntary and that it, “does not authorize anyone to enter your home, for whatever reason, without your permission, nor does it allow the government to remove anyone from your home because of the coronavirus.”11

However, there does not appear to be any language in the proposed bill that protects these rights. And, the bill provides no assurance that the federally funded surveillance programs will not be mandated in the future by federal, state or local governments, employers or other entities.

Disguised Massive Government Surveillance Program

Representative Rush posted on Twitter that, “There is nothing in this bill that will threaten anyone’s individual liberties.12

Critics disagree, however. A Washington, DC journalist commented;

This is nothing but a massive government surveillance program cloaked in a cure-the-coronavirus label… H.R. 6666 takes COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and turns it into a mass surveillance authority for government against society. And it does it deceptively so, under the guise of providing a societal good.13

The bill is vague and overreaching as it grants the Secretary of HHS the unchecked authority to determine what type of entity would qualify for funding and allows for unspecified medical surveillance. It does not define “related activities” or “other purposes” and has no set end date.

There are no limits placed on the use of the information collected by these government funded entities. The information gathered while testing, tracking and monitoring citizens could be stored in a government database and potentially be used for any purpose including forced vaccination.

Government Officials Meeting with Silicon Valley

The introduction of H.R. 6666 is not the first attempt by the federal government to incentivize private companies to create a surveillance system in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The White House has been holding private talks with technology companies and social media giants such as Facebook and Goggle in an effort to track the spread of corona virus through the implementation of digital contract tracing applications (DCT) using location data from mobile phones for public health surveillance.14 15

Although DCT apps would track and monitor citizens using their mobile phones, government sources contend that privacy would not be a concern as the electronic data would be collected anonymously in aggregate form and maintain that the government is not looking to build a database.16

The creation of a large government database is concerning because the personal information stored on it could be at risk for being used for a number of purposes, including those that are unrelated to COVID-19. Large databases are also vulnerable to breech by identity thieves, foreign governments and stalkers.17

Cell Phones to Track Users Health and COVID-19 Status

In response to these White House talks, on Apr.10, 2010, Apple and Google announced they were undertaking a joint effort to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 using Bluetooth technology to build a platform that would support DCT apps.18 The technology will be built into the framework of mobile devises and will allow DCT apps, once developed and downloaded by the user, to notify individuals if their phone was in close proximity of an individual who tested positive for COVID-19.19 Apple and Google emphasize that user privacy will be maintained as data locations will be stored on the user’s own phone rather than collected and stored on a centralized database.20

This surveillance technology hardly seems voluntary as it will automatically be installed on mobile phones when they are updated “to help ensure broad adoption.”21 However, Apple and Google claim that that, even though the software will automatically install on user’s phones without their consent, users will be in control by having the option of turning the technology on and off or uninstalling the technology altogether, and will have the choice to install DCT apps on their phone.22 23

Even if the user does have some control over this technology and the DCT apps it supports for now, it is easy to imagine a scenario where employers, businesses, restaurants, stores and other places require the use of this technology in the near future. In fact, technology companies are already developing apps that would allow employers to digitally track and trace their employees.24

In addition to privacy concerns, there is no certainty that DCT apps will work to control the spread of COVID-19. DCT apps may prove over-inclusive and cause self-isolation burn-out when a healthy person is directed multiple times to self-quarantine after a number of quick or fleeting exposures that are unlikely to cause transmission of the virus and may be under-inclusive in that it will not alert individuals that they may have touched a surface that a COVID-19 infected person touched hours earlier.25

First, app notifications of contact with COVID-19 are likely to be simultaneously both over- and under-inclusive. Experts in several disciplines have shown why mobile phones and their sensors make for imperfect proxies for coronavirus exposure. False positives (reports of exposure when none existed) can arise easily. Individuals may be flagged as having contacted one another despite very low possibility of transmission—such as when the individuals are separated by walls porous enough for a Bluetooth signal to penetrate. Nor do the systems account for when individuals take precautions, such as the use of personal protective equipment, in their interactions with others.26

In order to be effective, approximately 60% of the population must participate in digital contract tracing. However, almost 60 percent of respondents to a recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll said they would refuse to participate in digital contact tracing due to privacy concerns or technological hurdles.27 With the majority of Americans hesitant or unwilling to consent to using DCT apps, the question remains: will Congress pass H.R. 6666 and the federal government violate our civil liberties by mandating that all Americans participate in digital contact tracing in order to justify its one hundred billion dollar plus price tag?

Allergy Risks Increase as FDA Changes Food Labeling Requirements During COVID-19 Pandemic,"Opinion | On May 22, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public comment providing new guidance that will relax the labeling requirements on packaged food to allow food companies more flexibility during the COVD-19 pandemic. Companies selling food are now allowed to make minor changes to the formulation of food products without being required to change the product label, raising the risks for serious food allergies.

FDA Made Change Without Public Comment

The FDA’s stated goal of changing food labeling requirements is to minimize the effects of food supply chain disruption and meet consumer demand.1 A departure from the standard practice of first taking public comment before issuing new guidance to companies selling products that carry health risks, this guidance by the FDA took effect immediately without public comment.2

The FDA is the oldest U.S. government consumer protection agency.3 The Federal Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act granted the FDA the authority to protect consumers from unsafe products by requiring that most prepared and packaged foods be accurately labeled by the manufacturer.4

The FDA states;

Consumers use the ingredient list to make purchasing decisions and determine whether a food contains an ingredient they want (e.g., whole grains) or ones they do not want (e.g., due to allergies). Without this ingredient information, consumers would not be able make nutrition-based food decisions, as well as avoid ingredients for health or other reasons.5

Protecting Food Company Profits But What About Safety?

However, during the coronavirus pandemic, it appears that the FDA has shifted its responsibility from protecting consumers to helping food companies protect their profits from any lost business stemming from potential disruption of the food supply chain.6

The guidelines provide that manufacturers may substitute a minor ingredient in a recipe without changing the label when the substituted ingredient:

is not known to cause adverse health effects such as food allergens, gluten, sulfites; is generally less than 2 percent of the product weight; is not be a major product ingredient; is not a characterizing ingredient; does not affect the nutrient content or health claims on the product label; and does not have a significant impact on the finished product.7

A label does not need to be changed, for example, when certain oils that contain a similar type of fat have been substituted in a recipe, such as canola oil for sunflower oil, or when an oil is highly refined and does not pose a risk for an allergic reaction according to the FDA.8 However, many people have allergic reactions to highly refined products derived from one of the top eight allergens such as such as peanut oil or soy lecithin.9

The FDA guidance provides that minor formulation changes may be made as long as the substituted ingredient,

does not cause adverse health effect “(including food allergens, gluten, sulfites, or other foods known to cause sensitivities in some people, for example, glutamates).10

The FDA does not define what ingredients are considered to cause an “adverse health effect.”11 Food allergies are unique in that an individual may react to ingredients the FDA does not consider allergens. According to the Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) more than 170 foods have been reported to cause allergic reactions.12

Cross Contamination A Safety Issue

The guidance states that food companies must continue to list the top 8 allergens including peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, soy, wheat, fish, and crustacean shellfish on the package ingredient list. However, there is still cause for concern for those allergic to the top eight allergens even when other ingredients are substituted because of cross-contamination.

Take the example of a milk chocolate bar that carries the advisory statement: “Made on equipment that also processes almonds.” If the manufacturer decides to substitute peanut flour for almond flour in another product in the same line, that advisory statement may be rendered incorrect or incomplete.13

Manufacturers are not required to list the substituted ingredients of their food products on labels, or on their website or a central FDA website. The only way to find out if an ingredient was substituted and what it was substituted for is to call the manufacturers for every food product.14

32 Million Americans With Food Allergies

Approximately 32 million American live with a food allergy.15 In 2018, it was estimated that eight percent or one in 13 children and 1 in 10 adults had a food allergy.16 According to the CDC, food allergies increased 50 percent between 1997 to 2011. Between 1997 and 2008, peanut and tree nut allergies have tripled in children in the U.S.17

Food allergy reactions range from mild such as a few hives to life threatening anaphylactic reactions. In the U.S each year, allergic reactions to food send 200,000 people to seek emergency medical care.18

Allergic Reactions Are Life Threatening

Life threatening allergic reactions require the immediate use of an epi-pen within minutes of the start of symptoms of a reaction. Medical professionals instruct that anyone having an anaphylactic reaction immediately inject an epi-pen and then go to the hospital. While going to the hospital after an allergic reaction is always a cause for concern, it is an even more frightening experience during the COVID-19 crisis.

In order to protect their children from the risk of an allergic reaction, food allergy parents know exactly what packaged food their child can eat and what ingredients they need to stay away from. Many families have learned the hard way to have a list of safe snacks and not to vary their food choices. Even a small change in the type of spice or kind of oil used in a recipe could cause a child to react negatively or even go into anaphylactic shock.

Food Allergies of Special Concern in Autism Community

Food allergies are of special concern for parents of very young children or non-verbal children with autism, who may not be able to effectively communicate that they are having an allergic reaction.

These new guidelines will particularly affect the autism community. One in 54 children in the United States have autism. Studies have shown that children with autism are five times as likely as other children to have difficult eating habits such as only eating a narrow range of food items.19

Children with autism have an increased risk of food allergies.20 According to a study, 11.25 percent of children with autism had a food allergy compared to 4.25 percent of children without autism.21 22

Substituting ingredients in products without making corresponding changes to the label is especially concerning with nonverbal children on the autism spectrum, who may not be able to effectively communicate a reaction to foods they were once able to tolerate.

New Food Labeling Guidelines Could Remain in Effect Long Term

The FDA has stated that the new guidelines were issued in response to the COVD-19 pandemic. However, there is no set end date and these changes may be extended or renewed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services if food companies say they need additional time to restock supply chains.

Although the new guidelines went into effect immediately, without first taking public comments, public comments may be submitted at any time for FDA’s consideration.

The FDA provides,

… upon termination of the public health emergency, FDA intends to consider and publicly communicate regarding whether an extension, in whole or in part, is warranted, based on comments received to this guidance and our experience with its implementation.23

U.S. Surveillance Bill 6666: The Devil in the Details,"Opinion | As if vaccine passports, COVID-19 contact tracing apps and the Rockefeller Foundation’s plan to reopen America don’t already pose enough of a threat to civil liberties and democratic society, here comes a new bill, H.R. 6666, the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act.1

The bill was introduced and referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., May 1, 2020. As of May 25, 2020, the bill has 64 cosponsors—all Democrats. Originally, there also was one Republican, but he withdrew his sponsorship May 15. According to the summary of the bill:2

This bill authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to award grants for testing, contact tracing, monitoring, and other activities to address COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Entities such as federally qualified health centers, nonprofit organizations, and certain hospitals and schools are eligible to receive such grants. In awarding the grants, the CDC shall prioritize applicants that (1) operate in hot spots and medically underserved communities, and (2) agree to hire individuals from the communities where grant activities occur.

H.R. 6666—A ‘Monstrously Unconstitutional’ Bill

Needless to say, many an eyebrow are being raised over the “6666” in the resolution. It seems both unfortunate and ironically apt. As noted by Cheryl Chumley in a May 12, 2020, Washington Times article:3

Mark of the beast. Mark of the beast for a beastly, monstrously unconstitutional bill. After all, what’s more devilishly un-American than launching one of the most massive government surveillance programs of private citizens in U.S. history, all under the guise of protecting people from the coronavirus?

The government grants—a whopping $100 billion of taxpayer money for 2020 alone—would be used by “eligible entities” to hire employees and buy the supplies needed to conduct testing and contact tracing. This includes sending employees to the residences of citizens to conduct COVID-19 testing.

Entities eligible for grant money include federally qualified health centers, school-based clinics, disproportionate share hospitals, academic medical centers, nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, high schools and any other entities determined to be eligible by the Health and Human Services Secretary.

If you test positive, you would then be quarantined either at a mobile health unit or in your own home. Contact tracers would also collect information about anyone you may have come into contact with so that they can be tested and, if needed, quarantined.

As noted by Chumley, just how the government intends to ensure compliance with quarantine remains an unanswered question. We now know that up to 80 percent of people who test positive remain asymptomatic,4 and for people who feel fine, being locked up, whether at home or in a mobile unit, for two weeks or more may not be a welcome proposition at this point.

COVID-19 Does Not Warrant Proposed Tracking Measures

In a nutshell, H.R. 6666 calls for taking $100 billion of our taxpayer money to fund our own persecution. I say “persecution,” considering this virus isn’t particularly lethal for people under the age of 80, and has an overall survival rate of about 99 percent and therefore doesn’t pose a significant threat for the vast majority of the population.

At present, most data are still unreliable, seeing how “suspected” cases are lumped into mortality statistics. But two situations for which we have more complete data suggest the risk from SARS-CoV-2 is minimal.

For example, of the roughly 4,800 crew on the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, 840 tested positive,5 but 60 percent were asymptomatic,6 meaning they had no symptoms. Only one crewmember died.7

Similarly, among the 3,711 passengers and crew onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 712 (19.2 percent) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and of these 46.5 percent were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Of those showing symptoms, only 9.7 percent required intensive care and 1.3 percent (nine) died.8

Military personnel, as you would expect, tend to be healthier than the general population. Still, the data from these two incidents reveal several important points to consider. First of all, it suggests that even when living in close, crowded quarters, the infection rate is low.

Only 17.5 percent of the USS Theodore Roosevelt crew got infected—slightly lower than the 19.2 percent of those onboard the Diamond Princess, which had a greater ratio of older people.

Second, fit and healthy individuals are more likely to be asymptomatic than not—60 percent of naval personnel compared to 46.5 percent of civilians onboard the Diamond Princess had no symptoms despite testing positive.

‘Devilish’ in Its Substance

While H.R. 6666 may not be satanic, it’s certainly “devilish,” Bob Barr writes in a May 20, 2020, Marietta Daily Journal op-ed.9 Barr, president and CEO of the Law Enforcement Education Foundation, is a former U.S. Congressman for Georgia’s Seventh District.

Make no mistake … the bill is a dangerous piece of legislation, not because of its number, but because of its substance,” Barr writes. “It is the latest in a long line of legislative vehicles … to increase the federal government’s power to gather and database private information on citizens …

In this latest effort, House Democrats have employed the tradecraft for which the Congress has become notoriously adept—hiding the true purpose of legislation behind a façade of protecting people from a known or perceived danger …

The specific provisions within H.R. 6666 pose a very real danger; not only as a stand-alone bill … but as a possible amendment that could be slipped into the most recent, massive COVID-19 ‘stimulus’ bill that passed the House last week.

The administration already has signaled support for some version of a Phase IV relief package, and whatever that final document looks like, it is certain to be long and complicated, making it a perfect vehicle in which to hide a provision for ‘contact tracing’ similar perhaps to what Rush’s TRACE Act would do …

Those of us who are concerned about the growth of government surveillance and data-basing of personal information must be vigilant against measures like the TRACE Act, regardless of their surface appeal. We must demand the Congress and the Administration aggressively oppose any such measures.

WARNING: Apple, Android Updates Include API for Tracing Apps

Considering the latest iPhone and Android updates make the phones contact-tracing ready, the bill has, in pragmatic terms, already come to pass.

As reported by Global World Trends,10 Apple’s iOS 13.5 update contains a built-in Exposure Notifications API, which will “allow governments and public health agencies to develop apps that alert you if you’ve come into contact with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19 and that person anonymously logs their positive result into a database.”

API stands for “application programming interface.”11 It’s essentially a set of functions that allow apps to access certain data or features of the operating system. That said, you would still have to download a contact tracing app in order to participate in a contact tracing program, according to an Apple representative.12

HR 6666 Sets Us on a Dangerous Path

As detailed by the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) in a recent “Action Alert” emailed to users of NVIC’s Advocacy Portal:13

H.R. 6666 is a federal funding bill. It proposes to create a surveillance infrastructure that can be used by the federal government, as well as local and state governments and private businesses, to require medical testing and tracking of all citizens.

This is in violation of fundamental civil liberties as set forth in the Bill of Rights, which include the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution designed to protect individual rights and limit the power of the government.

H.R. 6666 lacks safeguards and conditions related to funding of the proposed surveillance operation to prevent it from being applied to intrusive programs mandating testing and surveillance without an individual’s voluntary consent.

If this legislation is passed by Congress and enacted into law, it could lead to denial of an individual’s right to appear in public spaces and travel; the right to employment and education or participation in government-funded services, and the right to receive care in a government funded hospital or other any other medical facility.

H.R. 6666 specifically allows for funded entities to home quarantine a person against their will, even while they are healthy. Once a vaccine is available, the testing and tracing results potentially could be used to force individuals to be injected with a COVID-19 vaccine against their will.

As noted by NVIC, while the bill specifies that “Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede any Federal privacy or confidentiality requirement, including the regulations promulgated under section 264(c) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,” H.R. 6666 in no way guarantees privacy.

HIPAA “has always allowed disclosure of private health information to government officials and other government approved entities including foreign governments without the knowledge or consent of the individual for the purpose of conducting public health surveillance, investigations or interventions,” NVIC writes.14

Public Health Crisis Does Not Suspend Bill of Rights

NVIC also highlights the fact that the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution cannot be suspended or ignored by state or federal government during public health emergencies.

As noted by the U.S. Department of Justice in a recent Statement of Interest in Support of Plaintiffs in the case of Temple Baptist Church against the City of Greenville and its mayor, which banned drive-in church services and slapped attendees with fines:15

There is no pandemic exception, however, to the fundamental liberties the Constitution safeguards. Indeed, ‘individual rights secured by the Constitution do not disappear during a public health crisis.’

In re Abbott,—F.3d—, 2020 WL 1685929, at *6 (5th Cir. Apr. 7, 2020). These individual rights, including the protections in the Bill of Rights made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, are always in force and restrain government action.

Indeed, H.R. 6666 “sets the stage for multiple violations of our constitutional rights,” NVIC notes, including the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Ninth amendments:

•The Fourth Amendment16 right of American citizens is to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. As explained by NVIC: The bill does not allow individuals to exercise their Constitutional right to be safe in their homes free from warrantless government intrusion, and does not provide for voluntary refusal of testing and monitoring by a government funded entity. The bill also does not set forth how the contacts of persons with COVID-19 will be traced and whether the Constitutional rights of those infected with COVID-19, as well as their contacts, will be upheld. •The Fifth Amendment17 of the U.S. Constitution guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law. This legislation provides government funding of entities that will enforce testing and potentially enforce vaccination of healthy individuals, who are suspected of having come into contact with COVID-19 positive persons whether or not they are exhibiting symptoms, without requiring the voluntary consent of the individual,” NVIC writes. •The Eighth Amendment18 prohibits cruel and unusual punishment of citizens. In this case, as noted by NVIC: The proposed law provides government funding to entities that will create and implement programs that trace, monitor and support the enforced quarantine of healthy individuals, who are suspected of coming into contact with COVID-19 persons, whether or not they are exhibiting symptoms and whether or not they may already be immune. •The 9th Amendment19 of the U.S. Constitution bestows upon the people rights not specifically set forth in the Constitution. H.R. 6666 provides funding for entities to create and implement undefined ‘related activities’ to COVID-19 testing and unnamed ‘other purposes.’

Take Action Today!

“H.R. 6666 should be opposed because it provides federal funding to entities to create and enforce unrestricted surveillance, testing, tracing and quarantine mechanisms and has no set end date. There is simply no way to know how many inalienable rights protected under the U.S. Constitution could be infringed upon or taken away from citizens if this bill becomes law,” NVIC says.

I urge you to take action today and help us stop this nasty bill. Call and email your U.S. congressional representative and ask them to vote against H.R. 6666, the “COVID–19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act.”

Sweden’s Different Response to COVID-19 Based on Mutual Respect...,"Story Highlights Unlike most other countries, Sweden has not enforced nationwide lockdowns and home quarantines to combat the spread of COVID-19, instead relying on individual citizens to voluntarily follow the government’s suggested guidelines for social distancing to protect the vulnerable.

So far, both the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths are higher in Sweden than in neighboring Nordic countries, but Swedish authorities have maintained their approach is scientifically sound and are hoping to soon achieve natural herd immunity.

Some, like Dr. Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization, have praised Sweden’s less restrictive approach, while others have criticized it as putting too many people at risk for infection and fatal complications.

As many countries around the world remain under national lockdown conditions that include widespread home quarantines and closing of schools and businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sweden has taken a more relaxed stance to dealing with the new coronavirus.1 Unlike most countries, including neighboring Norway, Finland and Denmark, Sweden has not closed businesses, primary schools, restaurants, parks or other public gathering places, instead urging citizens to “act responsibly and follow social distancing guidelines.”

Sweden has a population of about 10 million people,2 and the population characteristics of Swedish society contributes to the feasibility of the more relaxed guidelines. For example, as many as 40 percent of Swedish households are made up of single adults without children, which automatically builds in a certain level of “social distancing.”3

Strong Government Recommendations for Social Distancing

Sweden has not confined the whole population to home quarantine or closed down its economy. However, it is not really “business as usual” in Sweden either. Government health officials have issued strong recommendations for social distancing to protect those most vulnerable to COVID-19 complications and death and the sick are quarantined, but the guidelines remain voluntary in most cases.

Although the government is poised to impose stricter disease control practices if necessary, Sweden has a long history of respect and trust between the government and the people. Opinion polls show that 48 percent of the population has a high or very high rate of confidence in the trustworthiness of public health officials.

With regard to COVID-19, the Swedish people are generally keeping with their traditional trust in government health officials and the disease control strategies they recommend. The politicians, in turn, are trusting the people to follow the advice given by the government.4

Sweden Hopeful It Is Nearing Peak Infection Period and Herd Immunity

Although authorities warn it is too soon to draw any conclusions, they say the numbers suggest that Sweden may be just about over the peak infection period, with a flattening curve both for new cases and for patients admitted to intensive care units. According to Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist at Sweden’s Public Health Agency, who is described as the architect of Sweden’s COVID-19 response approach, the latest figures on both number of infections and deaths are starting to stabilize.

In early April, Dr. Tegnell said that COVID-19 would be controlled by “herd immunity or a combination of immunity and vaccination.”5 In late April, he and other Swedish public health officials commented that Sweden’s peak transmission period of COVID-19 infections may have occurred around the Easter holiday and that case reports suggest Sweden is currently in a peak infection phase and could achieve herd immunity soon.6

What Is Herd Immunity?

Herd immunity is a term that is often used to describe the proportion of people in a population who have been vaccinated, although it is also used to describe the proportion of people in a population who have acquired natural immunity from experiencing and recovering from an infectious disease. According to the Farlex Medical Dictionary, herd immunity is defined as:7

The resistance to invasion and spread of an infectious agent in a group or community, based on the resistance to infection of a high proportion of individual members of the group… A measure of the transmission potential of a disease, which corresponds to the number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population that is totally susceptible, and can be quantified by counting the number of secondary cases following the introduction of an infection into a totally susceptible population. Herd immunity occurs when a significant proportion of the population (or the herd) have been vaccinated, and this provides protection for unprotected individuals.

According to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, “Depending how contagious an infection is, usually 70% to 90% of a population needs immunity to achieve herd immunity,” and that for COVID-19, “based on early estimates of this virus’s infectiousness, we will likely need at least 70% of the population to be immune to have herd protection.”8

Disagreement Among Swedish Health Officials

There has been some pushback from many infectious disease specialists in Sweden, who argue that there are too many unknowns about COVID-19 and it is too contagious and deadly to wait for a large enough proportion of the population to develop herd immunity by experiencing and recovering from the infection. Nele Brusselaers, an associate professor of clinical epidemiology, even questions whether recovering from COVID-19 infection provides any immunity at all. He said, “Herd immunity doesn’t make sense because we don’t know whether or not you can become immune…this is a virus that can kill anybody.”9

Dr. Tegnell denies that seeking COVID-19 herd immunity without implementing any type of intervention was ever part of their plan.10 In an Apr. 28, 2020 interview with USA Today, Dr. Tegnell explained, “We are trying to keep transmission rates at a level that the Stockholm health system can sustain. So far that has worked out. The health system is stressed. They are working very hard. But they have delivered health care to everybody, including those without COVID-19. That is our goal.”11

Higher Mortality in Sweden, Especially in Nursing Home Patients

Sweden has reported a significantly higher number of cases and deaths compared to reports from other Scandinavian countries, particularly among nursing home patients. This fact has led many to question Sweden’s disease control strategy, with Prime Minister Stefan Lofven admitting, “The protection for people in elderly care should have been better… We need to look closer at what has gone wrong.”12

As of May 15, 2020, Sweden has reported more COVID-19 cases and related deaths than have been reported by neighboring countries:13

Sweden: 29,207 cases and 3,646 deaths (population about 10M)

Denmark: 10,791 cases and 537 deaths (population about 5.8M)

Norway: 8,196 cases and 232 deaths (population about 5.5M)

Finland: 6,228 cases and 293 deaths (population about 5.5M)

The COVID-19 case and death numbers for countries are updated daily here.

Strong Guidelines, Voluntary Compliance Define Sweden’s Measured Approach

In a briefing to the World Health Organization (WHO), Sweden’s Minister for Health and Social Affairs Lena Hallengren outlined the nation’s measured approach to the coronavirus pandemic.14 She explaining that “fundamental characteristics of the Swedish society,” such as its publicly funded universal healthcare system, have allowed the country to be more flexible in its response and allowed the government to quickly change course and impose stricter regulations, if deemed necessary.

The key elements of Sweden’s COViD-19 response plan, as it stands now, echo procedures being followed in other countries, although most disease control measures in Sweden are still voluntary in contrast to involuntary lockdowns implemented in the U.S. and other countries:

The Swedish government accepts final responsibility for protocols but is following the recommendations of its own expert agencies, as well as those of international powers such as the WHO.

Top priority is being given to protecting vulnerable groups such as the elderly, which now includes a ban on visitors to nursing homes and strict recommendations limiting social contact for people over age 70, both urging the elderly themselves to stay at home and advising against visiting elders in the community.

Key tools include recommendations for social distancing and providing incentives for people to stay at home. Pointing to Sweden’s “generous welfare system” that makes it easier for people to stay home if they are sick, Minister of Health Hallengren says both employees and the self-employed are now able to be paid sick leave from the first day and are no longer required to have a doctor’s certificate.

Public gatherings of more than 50 people have been banned.

Tools are in place to facilitate social distancing by providing online education for upper secondary schools (high school) and university education.

In concluding her address, Hallengren said:

There is no unique Swedish way of dealing with COVID-19. We share the same goals as other countries, we face the same challenges as other countries and we use similar tools as other countries. We do what we think works best for Sweden in our national circumstances. And we are always prepared to implement stricter measures if necessary.15

Experts Are Divided in Support of Sweden’s Tactics

Urging everyone to remain calm, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven has asked Swedes to “behave ‘as adults’ and not to spread ‘panic or rumours.’” However criticism of the government’s response to COVID-19 continues. More than 2,000 doctors, scientists and professors signed a petition at the end of March that called on the government to impose far more stringent disease control measures. Professor Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér, a virus immunology researcher at the Karolinska Institute warned, “We’re not testing enough, we’re not tracking, we’re not isolating enough—we have let the virus loose… They are leading us to catastrophe.”16

Countering criticism of Sweden’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Mike Ryan, Executive Director for Health Emergencies for the WHO, praised the more measured approach Swedish health officials have taken. Dr. Ryan said that Sweden may provide the best model for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic because it is sustainable over the long term, commenting that:17

If we are to reach a new normal, I think in many ways Sweden represents a future model—if we wish to get back to a society in which we don’t have lockdowns.18

CDC Publishes Final Rule on Quarantine Powers,"The federal government’s legal authority to detain and quarantine persons infected with certain highly communicable and deadly infectious diseases historically primarily has involved detaining people entering the U.S. by boats and airplanes or traveling across state lines.

Federal government officials have long had the authority to apprehend, isolate and quarantine people for a limited number of infectious diseases on the U.S. quarantine list.

However, the legal authority for surveillance, detention and quarantining of citizens residing in the U.S. suspected of being infected with certain non-quarantinable communicable diseases historically has resided with state government health officials.1

On Jan. 17, 2017, the last day of the Obama administration, a new final rule on the Control of Communicable Diseases was issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that is schedule to take effect in March.

The new rule gives the CDC expanded authority to apprehend, isolate and quarantine for at least 72 hours a person entering the U.S. or traveling between states, who is suspected of being infected, or at risk of being infected, with one of the nine diseases on the U.S. quarantine list (cholera, plague, diphtheria, smallpox, yellow fever, infectious tuberculosis, viral hemorrhagic fevers [like Ebola], severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and influenza) that can cause a pandemic.2

The rule also strengthens federal surveillance of travelers for symptoms of non-quarantinable diseases like measles, pertussis and meningococcal disease.3

While proponents are touting the changes as necessary to protect the public health, critics have been arguing since the CDC first published the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in August 2016, that it is an example of government overreach, which poses a risk to health and civil liberties.4

Because the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) and other organizations advocating for protection of civil liberties urged Americans to contact the CDC and oppose the NPRM last summer, the CDC received more than 15,000 comments from the public, many of them expressing concern that the rule violated the U.S. Constitution, and human and civil rights.

Although the CDC rejected this characterization, the agency did make changes to the final rule, including eliminating a provision that would have allowed the CDC to require individuals to agree to submit to public health measures such as hospitalization, vaccination and medical treatment.

In addition, the final rule states that medical examinations can only be conducted with prior informed consent.5

Who Could Be Quarantined Under the New Rule?

The new rule gives the CDC the power to detain for further health assessment a person who is crossing the U.S. or state borders if he or she is exhibiting certain infection symptoms associated with quarantinable diseases, such as fever, headache and acute gastroenteritis (abdominal cramps, loose stools or vomiting).

The new rule also makes it clear that rash and cough symptoms of non-quarantinable infectious diseases, such as measles and pertussis, among travelers are going to be more closely monitored by federal government officials as well.

For non-quarantinable diseases, CDC will be working with state health departments, who have the legal authority to detain and quarantine citizens suspected of being infected with, or at risk for, being infected with a communicable disease.

James Hodge Jr., a professor of public health law and ethics at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University, told NPR, “Because of the breadth and scope of the definition of ill persons, CDC can target a much wider swath of persons to assess and screen.”6

Airline Pilots and Ship Operators to Become Surveillance Crews?

The new rule also includes new reporting requirements for airplanes and ships. If the rules take effect, airline pilots and ship operators would be required to report not only deaths on board but also “certain overt and common signs and symptoms of sick travelers” to the CDC prior to arriving into the U.S. Barbara Loe Fisher, NVIC co-founder and president noted:7

It is not a good idea to make the public’s airport experience even more difficult by enlisting flight crews to report passengers with symptoms that could be nothing more than eczema, acne, norovirus or the common cold.

… What started out as a vacation could be turned into a nightmare spent in an airport quarantine center.

The required signs and symptoms include the following, and must be reported not only during international travel, but also on airline flights flying domestically, between states:8

Airlines

(1) Fever (defined as measured temperature of 100.4 degrees F [38 degrees C] or greater, feels warm to the touch or gives a history of feeling feverish)

AND one of the following:

Skin rash

Difficulty breathing

Persistent cough

Decreased consciousness or recent onset of confusion

New unexplained bleeding or bruising

Persistent diarrhea

Persistent vomiting (other than airsickness)

Headache with stiff neck

Appearing obviously unwell; OR

(2) Fever that has persisted for more than 48 hours; OR

(3) Other signs or symptoms of communicable disease CDC is concerned about and has announced in the Federal Register.

Ships

(1) Fever (defined as measured temperature of 100.4 degrees F [38 degrees C] or greater, feels warm to the touch or gives a history of feeling feverish)

AND one of the following:

Skin rash

Difficulty breathing or suspected or confirmed pneumonia

Persistent cough or cough with bloody sputum

Decreased consciousness or recent onset of confusion

New unexplained bruising or bleeding

Persistent vomiting (other than seasickness)

Headache with stiff neck

Appearing obviously unwell; OR

(2) Fever that has persisted for more than 48 hours; OR

(3) Acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of stomach or intestines or both), defined as:

Diarrhea, defined as within a 24-hour period, three or more episodes of loose stools or an occurrence of loose stools that is above normal for the person, or

Vomiting and one or more of the following additional symptoms: one or more episodes of loose stools in a 24-hour period, abdominal cramps, headache, muscle aches or fever (temperature of 100.4 degrees F [38 degrees C] or greater); OR

(4) Other signs or symptoms of communicable disease CDC is concerned about and has announced in the Federal Register.

Is This Part of Global Efforts to Eradicate Measles?

In August 2016, NPRM, the CDC pointed to “the ongoing persistence of measles in the United States” as an example of why the updated rules are necessary. They even said, “Every case of measles in the United States is considered a public health emergency because of its extremely high transmissibility.”9

The World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. health officials have targeted mass MMR vaccination campaigns as the solution to eradicating measles, even though serious questions remain about the vaccine’s efficacy and safety.

In the final rule, measles outbreaks in the U.S. were again highlighted. It illustrates why travelers with a rash or cough could become the subject of scrutiny and reporting to the CDC by airline and other public transportation personnel as the federal government more closely monitors almost all signs of illness in all travelers.

Will the New Rules Backfire?

Once it becomes widespread knowledge that an airline pilot or ship’s captain must report symptoms of common illness directly to the federal government, and that information could be used to immediately detain or quarantine you, there’s a good chance people may try to evade the system. Jennifer Nuzzo, a research epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told NPR:10

The worst-case scenario is that people may try to evade these procedures by, say, taking medicines to reduce their fever, or be afraid to report it if they are feeling ill on a plane … We don’t want to drive cases underground by putting measures in place that seem as though they carry some penalties associated with them.

Emergency Health Measures Should Be Grounded in Science, Not Fear

While one concern is that increased surveillance of travelers by health officials could drive diseases underground, another is that overreaching power could allow people to be wrongly detained. An op-ed piece in The New York Times described the case of Kaci Hickox, who had volunteered as a nurse treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, West Africa.

She had no known exposure to the disease, as she had worn heavy protective gear, but upon her return to the U.S., New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ordered her quarantined to an area hospital. This was against the current CDC guidelines, which stated she should monitor herself for symptoms at home.

“It’s imperative that whenever the next outbreak hits, emergency health measures are grounded in scientific evidence and guided by clear, fair rules to protect people from wrongful deprivation of their liberties,” the Times piece states, continuing:11

That incident wasn’t an anomaly. During a bubonic plague outbreak in 1900, for example, government officials quarantined the entire Chinatown neighborhood of San Francisco.

The quarantine applied only to Chinese residents, and lacked any scientific basis. It was fueled by little more than naked fear and racism. Given this history, we want to ensure that federal officials applying the new regulations will act on the basis of science and evidence and not on politics and public fear.

What Diseases are Covered in the Quarantine Rules?

According to the new rules, “CDC may apprehend, detain, examine or conditionally release an individual if it reasonably believes that he/she may be infected with or exposed to a quarantinable communicable disease.”12 Those diseases currently include the following:

Cholera

Diphtheria

Infectious tuberculosis

Plague

Smallpox

Yellow fever

Viral hemorrhagic fevers (Lassa, Marburg, Ebola, Crimean-Congo, South American and others not yet isolated or named)

Severe acute respiratory syndromes (e.g., SARS, MERS)

Influenza caused by novel or reemergent influenza viruses that are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic

However, as mentioned, the new rule also allows the CDC to step up federal surveillance of travelers displaying a number of common illness symptoms associated with non-quarantinable diseases like measles and pertussis.

Although travelers found to be infected with or at risk for being infected with a non-quarantinable disease like measles cannot be quarantined by federal health officials, state health officials do have the legal authority to detain and quarantine residents infected with certain communicable diseases, depending upon the state’s public health laws.

The final rule was originally scheduled to go into effect Feb. 21, 2017. However, with the change in administration, the new regulations are being reviewed and will not take effect until the end of March 2017, at the earliest.13

NVIC Calls U.S. Proposal to Apprehend and Involuntarily Quarantine Travelers for Rashes and Cough A “Violation of Civil Liberties”,"A Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM): Control of Communicable Diseases was published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Aug. 15, 2016 that will amend federal public health law to allow health officials to take into custody and involuntarily quarantine travelers, who have symptoms of or have been exposed to someone with symptoms common to measles, chickenpox and a wide range of other communicable diseases. The non-profit National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is calling the proposed change to the Public Health Service Act “a violation of civil liberties.”

If the NPRM becomes law, it will affect American and non-American travelers entering the U.S. or traveling between states, particularly on commercial airlines and ships. The CDC is proposing to enlist commercial airline and other public transportation personnel to step up surveillance on and report “unwell” passengers with rashes, cough, diarrhea and other symptoms of illness.

“This is a clear case of federal government overreach,” said Barbara Loe Fisher, NVIC Co-founder and President.

Measles is not Ebola and chickenpox is not smallpox. U.S. health officials should not be expanding police power to take people into custody and place them in involuntary quarantine whenever they believe someone is sick or could become sick with illnesses that are far less serious than hemorrhagic fever and the plague.

If the NPRM becomes law, it appears U.S. health officials could hold a person in custody for 72 hours without the right to contact an attorney to appeal the detention. Detainees could be asked to sign a contract with the CDC that gives consent to the “public health measures” being applied to the adult or a minor child, which may include “quarantine, isolation, conditional release, medical examination, hospitalization, vaccination, and treatment.” However, the NPRM states that “the individual’s consent shall not be considered a prerequisite to any exercise of any authority” by the CDC. After release, the person can be electronically tracked and monitored, including by electronic tracking devices attached to the body.

“It is not a good idea to make the public’s airport experience even more difficult by enlisting flight crews to report passengers with symptoms that could be nothing more than eczema, acne, norovirus, or the common cold,” said Fisher.

It opens up the possibility for the detention and vaccination of an entire airplane full of passengers for a suspected case of measles or chickenpox. What started out as a vacation could be turned into a nightmare spent in an airport quarantine center.

The proposed law change particularly focuses on measles. “The ongoing persistence of measles in the United States provides a good example of the need for this NPRM,” states the CDC, and “every case of measles in the United States is considered a public health emergency because of its extremely high transmissibility.” Administration of MMR vaccine is part of the “post exposure” treatment protocol that can be applied before a detained person is released from the custody of health officials. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that drug companies selling government licensed and recommended vaccines in the U.S. cannot be held liable in a civil court of law for vaccine injuries and deaths.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. health officials are targeting measles for eradication using global mandatory, mass MMR vaccination campaigns similar to the global smallpox and polio vaccine campaigns. Although smallpox has been on the U.S. isolate and quarantine list for more than a century, polio was never put on that list, which also includes yellow fever, cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, hemorrhagic fever, SARS and pandemic influenza.

Constitutionally, U.S. states hold the majority of police power to control transmission of communicable diseases within state borders, but the federal government has authority to patrol U.S. borders and restrict travel between states. In 2014, a Presidential Executive Ordersignificantly expanded the authority for public health officials to apprehend and quarantine persons with symptoms of infections that are “highly likely to cause mortality or serious morbidity if not properly controlled.”

Americans have until Oct. 14, 2016 to make public comment to the CDC. For more information on the NPRM, read or watch a referenced commentary and access other U.S. government police power information here.

Open-Air Treatment During the “Spanish Flu” Pandemic,"Story Highlights The 1918 influenza pandemic known as the “Spanish flu” was caused by an H1N1 influenza virus and was the most deadly pandemic of the 20 th

Open-air treatment was used to treat patients and is believed to have reduced the number of deaths as well as transmission of infection among medical staff.

Historically, sunlight and open-air treatment has been used as an effective treatment for depression, war wounds, jaundice, Rickets and more.

Almost exactly a century ago, a new H1N1 influenza A strain known as the “Spanish flu” caused a global pandemic.1 Although there is no consensus regarding the origin of the novel influenza virus, it appeared suddenly and spread globally between 1918 and 1919.2 Estimates of the exact number of deaths caused by the virus vary according to different sources but it is thought to have infected a third of the world’s population and killed at least 50 million people, making it the deadliest infectious disease pandemic in modern history.3 Morbidity was high ranging from 25 percent to 90 percent and the fatality rate was between one to three percent.1

The conventional view during the Spanish flu pandemic, which occurred before antibiotics were widely available to treat bacterial pneumonia complications, was that nothing could be done to stop the spread of the H1N1 virus and that no treatment options were available at the time. However, there is evidence that some interventions did alter the course of the infection for some people.1

1918 Pandemic Influenza Overwhelmed Medical Facilities

Since the Spanish flu pandemic occurred during World War I, two of the most affected populations were soldiers living in military barracks and sailors on warships. Due to overcrowding and poor ventilation, soldiers and sailors were at high risk of contracting the influenza virus and other opportunistic infections, such as bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia, that can cause serious complications leading to death.4

When the pandemic reached the east coast of the United States in 1918, the city of Boston, Massachusetts was especially affected.4 With so many people infected with the virus and so many dying within a few weeks, the burden on medical facilities, medical staff and funeral homes was overwhelming. The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic also resulted in significant economic and social disruption.1

Public health authorities in the United States initiated measures that were used to control infectious disease epidemics during medieval times when populations suffered significant loss of life, such as during the Bubonic Plague.5 Their mitigation strategies aimed to reduce the transmission of the virus by preventing physical contact between the infected and the uninfected.

Orders issued by public health officials were based on what was known at the time in terms of understanding of how the influenza virus spread through the air by coughing and sneezing.5 After physicians concluded that the virus was transmitted through the air, efforts to control contagion were organized to prevent those infected from sharing the same air space as the uninfected. Public gatherings and close contact was seen as the primary avenue for quick transmission of the disease.5

U.S. Military Doctor Saves Lives with “Open Air” Treatment

The Massachusetts State Guard established an emergency hospital known as Camp Brooks Open Air Hospital at Corey Hill in Brookline near Boston, where sick sailors were hospitalized.1 4 Major Thomas F. Harrington, the hospital’s medical officer in charge, had studied the history of his patients and observed that sailors were housed in poorly ventilated rooms in the ships prior to hospitalization.1 He recommended that sick sailors be placed in tents to maximize their access to fresh air. In sunny weather, they were taken out of the tents and put into open air.4 Patients were kept warm in their beds at night with hot-water bottles and extra blankets and were fed every few hours.1

A combination of fresh air, sunlight, high standards of hygiene and reusable face masks appear to have substantially reduced deaths among some patients and reduced transmission of infections among medical staff.1

From when the hospital opened on September 9, 1918 until its closure a little more than a month later on October 12, a total of 351 patients were admitted, one third of whom were diagnosed with pneumonia. In total, 36 of the 351 sailors admitted to the hospital died.1

Out of all the hospital’s medical staff that included 15 doctors, 45 nurses and aides, 20 sanitary corps men and 74 sailors acting as orderlies, only six nurses and two orderlies developed influenza.1 In five of these cases, exposure to the virus was reported to have taken place outside the hospital. A few types of medicine were used to relieve the patients’ symptoms and help their recovery but these were considered less important than were regular meals, warmth and lots of fresh air and sunlight.1

Fresh Air and Sunshine Used for Tuberculosis

Dr. Arthur Ransome (1834–1922), a leading investigator on tuberculosis, emphasized the importance of fresh air in the disinfection of rooms occupied by tuberculosis patients and also in the disinfection of patients themselves. He said, “…abundant fresh air, together with sunshine, acts antiseptically upon both the bodies and the clothing of patients, destroying all organic impurities which may emanate from either, and so purifying the air that enters the respiratory organs.”6

Open-air therapy was a treatment that was widely used until 1950 when antibiotics were introduced.6 In addition, during the 1950s, chemotherapy replaced open-air treatment and belief in the therapeutic and germicidal properties of outdoor air diminished.6

Opposition to Open-Air Therapy

Despite opposition to open-air therapy, the surgeon general of the Massachusetts State Guard, Dr. William A. Brooks, was confident that open-air methods were effective in treating patients at the hospital.1 Many medical professionals believed that patients would reap the same benefits if the windows of a conventional hospital ward were open or the patients were put in a hospital “sun parlor.”1

However, Dr. Brooks held the position that patients did not do as well in an ordinary hospital, regardless of how well ventilated, as they did outdoors. His argument was that patients in indoor sun parlors were not exposed to direct sunlight all day as they were when they were outdoors.1 He reported that in one general hospital with 76 cases, 20 patients died within three days and 17 nurses became sick.

In contrast, the open-air treatment adopted at the Camp Brooks Open Air Hospital reduced the fatality of hospital cases from 40 percent to about 13 percent. Dr. Brooks said, “The efficacy of open air treatment has been absolutely proven, and one has only to try it to discover its value.”1

Sunlight and Infection Control to Prevent, Treat Disease

Studies have shown that ultraviolet radiation inactivates influenza virus and other viral pathogens and that sunlight also kills bacteria.1 Historically, exposure to the sunlight is known to facilitate healing in many conditions such as septic war wounds.1 There is also evidence to show that heart attack patients have a better chance of recovery if they are placed in sunlit wards.7 Psychiatric patients suffering from depression do better if they are exposed to sunlight while hospitalized8 and so do premature babies with jaundice.9

One of the major advantages of placing patients outside in the sun is that they can better synthesize vitamin D in their skin, which is not possible to do indoors behind glass1. Rickets, a childhood disease caused by vitamin D deficiency has always been associated with respiratory infections. Several studies have hypothesized that low levels of vitamin D increases susceptibility to influenza, which may explain the increased incidence of respiratory infections in patients with Rickets.1

According to a 2018 study published in International Journal of Molecular Sciences, the author Beata Gruber-Bzura writes that:

The studies clearly show that vitamin D is, undoubtedly, part of the complex factors which affect the immune response. So, assessing vitamin D status and maintaining optimal serum levels in all aging adults and children, and micronutrients should be regarded as one of the essential factors which improve our health condition overall and also support our fight against diseases.10

Will New COVID Vaccine Make You Transhuman?,"Two years ago, in October 2018, Forbes contributor Neil Sahota, a United Nations artificial intelligence adviser and UC Irvine professor, warned that transhumanism is fast approaching—likely faster than you think.1 “In the past few years, there has been considerable discussion around the idea we are slowly merging with our technology, that we are becoming transhuman, with updated abilities, including enhanced intelligence, strength, and awareness,” Sahota writes.

The goal of the transhumanist movement, or “Human 2.0,” is to transcend biology into technology. Or, as Dr. Carrie Madej explains in the video above, to meld human biology with technology and artificial intelligence.

Two visible proponents of transhumanism are Ray Kurzweil (director of engineering at Google since 2012) and Elon Musk (founder of SpaceX, Tesla and Neuralink).

Standing at the Crossroads of Transhumanism

According to Madej, right now, today, we may be standing at the literal crossroads of transhumanism, thanks to the fast approaching release of one or more mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

Many of the COVID-19 vaccines currently being fast-tracked are not conventional vaccines. Their design is aimed at manipulating your very biology, and therefore have the potential to alter the biology of the entire human race.

Conventional vaccines train your body to recognize and respond to the proteins of a particular virus by injecting a small amount of the actual viral protein into your body, thereby triggering an immune response and the development of antibodies.

This is not what happens with an mRNA vaccine. The theory behind these vaccines is that when you inject the mRNA into your cells, it will stimulate your cells to manufacture their own viral protein.2 The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will be the first of its kind. No mRNA vaccine has ever been licensed before. And, to add insult to injury, they’re forgoing all animal safety testing.

Madej reviews some of the background of certain individuals participating in the race for a COVID-19 vaccine, which include Moderna co-founder Derrick Rossi, a Harvard researcher who successfully reprogrammed stem cells using modified RNA, thus changing the function of the stem cells. Moderna was founded on this concept of being able to modify human biological function through genetic engineering, Madej says.

Side Effects Should Be Expected

As mentioned, the mRNA vaccines are designed to instruct your cells to make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the glycoprotein that attaches to the ACE2 receptor of the cell. This is the first stage of the two-stage process viruses use to gain entry into cells.

The idea is that by creating the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, your immune system will mount a response to it and begin producing antibodies to the virus. However, as reported by The Vaccine Reaction, researchers have pointed out potential weaknesses:3

According to researchers at University of Pennsylvania and Duke University, mRNA vaccines have potential safety issues, including local and systemic inflammation and stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies and autoimmunity, as well as development of edema (swelling) and blood clots.4

Systemic inflammation, auto-reactive antibodies and autoimmune problems are not insignificant concerns. In fact, these are in large part why previous attempts to create a coronavirus vaccine have ALL failed.

Over the past 20 years, coronavirus vaccine research has been plagued by one consistent adverse outcome in particular, namely paradoxical immune enhancement. This is caused by the fact that coronaviruses produce two different types of antibodies—neutralizing antibodies5 that fight the infection, and binding antibodies6 (also known as nonneutralizing antibodies) that cannot prevent viral infection.

Incapable of preventing viral infection, binding antibodies can instead trigger paradoxical immune enhancement. What that means is that it looks good until you get the disease, and then it makes the disease far worse than it would have been otherwise. As detailed in my interview with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in one coronavirus vaccine trial using ferrets, all the vaccinated animals died when exposed to the actual virus.

According to Madej, animal studies have also found the type of mRNA technology introduced with this vaccine can increase the risk of cancer and mutagenesis (gene mutations).

What You Need to Know About the Delivery System

Madej goes on to discuss how this mRNA vaccine is going to be administered. Rather than a conventional injection, the vaccine will be administered using a microneedle platform. Not only can it be mass produced quickly, but it can also be administered by anyone. It’s as simple at attaching an adhesive bandage to your arm.

The adhesive side of the bandage has rows of tiny microneedles and a hydrogel base that contains luciferase enzyme and the vaccine itself. Because of their tiny size, the microneedles are said to be nearly painless when pressed into the skin.

The idea is that the microneedles will puncture the skin, delivering the modified synthetic RNA into the nucleus of your cells. RNA is essentially coding material that your body uses. In this case, as mentioned, the instructions are to produce the SARS-CoV-2 viral protein.

The problem with all of this, Madej notes, is that they’re using a process called transfection — a process used to create genetically modified organisms. She points out that research has confirmed GMO foods are not as healthy as conventional unmodified foods. The question is, might we also become less healthy? “Vaccine manufacturers have stated that this will not alter our DNA, our genome,” Madej says.

I say that is not true. Because if we use this process to make a genetically modified organism, why would it not do the same thing to a human? I don’t know why they’re saying that. If you look at the definition of transfection, it will tell you that it can be a temporary change in the cell. And I think that is what the vaccine manufacturers are banking on.

Or, it’s a possibility for it to become stable, to be taken up into the genome, and to be so stable that it will start replicating when the genome replicates. Meaning it is now a permanent part of your genome. That’s a chance that we’re taking. It could be temporary, or it could be permanent.

Patentable DNA, Luciferase and Nanotechnology

Naturally, we won’t find out the truth about whether the vaccine causes a temporary or permanent change for many years after the experimental vaccine is introduced, and that’s an important piece of information.

Why? Because synthetic genes can be patented. So, if inserting a synthetic RNA ends up creating permanent changes in the genome, humans will contain patentable genes. What will that mean for us, seeing how patents have owners, and owners have patent rights?

Another part of the delivery system that raises its own set of questions is the use of the enzyme luciferase, which has bioluminescent qualities. While invisible under normal conditions, using a cellphone app or special device, you will be able to see a glowing vaccination mark.

As described in the journal RSC Advances7 in 2015, luciferase gene-loaded quantum dots “can efficiently deliver genes into cells.” The abstract discusses their use as “self-illuminating probes for hepatoma imaging,” but the fact that quantum dots can deliver genetic material is interesting in itself.

The hydrogel, meanwhile, is a DARPA invention that involves nanotechnology and nanobots. This “bioelectronic interface” is part of how the vaccination mark will be able to connect to your smartphone, Madej says, providing information about blood sugar, heart rate and any number of other biological data.

“It has the potential to see almost anything that goes on in your body,” Madej says. This will have immediate ramifications for our privacy, yet no one has yet addressed where this information will be going. Who will collect and have access to all this data? Who will be responsible for protecting it? How will it be used?

Also, if your cellphone can receive information from your body, what information can your body receive from it, or other sources? Could transmissions affect our mood? Our behavior? Our physical function? Our thoughts or memories?

Stepping Into Transhumanist Territory

In his Forbes article,8 Sahota quotes Kurzweil’s book “The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,” in which Kurzweil states:

The Singularity will represent the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology, resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots.

If Madej turns out to be correct, and the mRNA vaccine ushers in the ability to alter not only our genes but also opens the door for nanotechnology-driven interfacing between our bodies and programmable technology, aren’t we in fact stepping over the line into transhuman territory?

The Truthstream Media video above discusses the larger issues of transhumanism and the race to merge man with machine and artificial intelligence. There are even ongoing attempts to upload the human mind into the cloud, ultimately creating a form of “digital hive mind” where everyone communicates via “Wi-Fi telepathy.” This, despite the fact we still do not fully understand what “the mind” actually is, or where it’s located.

Neuralink—A Psychiatric Disaster in the Making?

Another transhumanist that has recently brought us to a brand-new precipice is Elon Musk, with his latest venture, Neuralink, described in the video presentation given in late August, above. Neuralink is a transcranial implant that uses direct current stimulation. For now, the device is aimed at helping people with brain or spinal injuries.

Ultimately, the goal is to merge the human brain with computers. I have strong reservations about this. There’s tremendous room for unintended psychological and psychiatric consequences. In an interview that I did with psychiatrist Dr. Peter Breggin that has not yet been published, he discussed his concerns with this technology, saying:

What’s interesting to me is that while Musk is so brilliant, he’s stupid about the brain. That’s probably because the neurosurgeons and psychiatrists he consults are stupid about the brain. I mean they’re just stupid.

He wants to put in multiple threadlike electrodes into the brain, into webs of neurons, and put in low voltage stimulation. This is insane. The brain can’t tolerate this. He hopes to [be able to] communicate but there’s not going to be any communication.

The brain isn’t going to talk to these electrodes. That’s not how the brain works. The brain talks to itself. It’s not going to talk to Elon Musk [or anyone else] and he’s going to disrupt the brain talking to itself. It’s a terrible thing to do.

I wish somebody who knows Elon Musk would say, ‘You ought to talk to Peter Breggin. He says your consultants are stupid.’ He’s already planning to try to get FDA approval for some neurological disorders and that’ll be the beginning of the onslaught.

Is Transhumanism Inevitable?

Getting back to the mRNA vaccines, time will tell just how hazardous they end up being. Clearly, if the changes end up being permanent, the chance of long-term side effects is much greater than if they end up being temporary.

In a worst-case scenario, whatever changes occur could even be generational. The problem is these issues won’t be readily apparent any time soon. In my view, this vaccine could easily turn into a global catastrophe the likes of which we’ve never experienced before.

We really should not be quick to dismiss the idea that these vaccines may cause permanent genetic changes, because we now have proof that even conventional vaccines have the ability to do that, and they don’t involve the insertion of synthetic RNA.

Fast-Tracked Swine Flu Vaccine Caused Genetic Alterations

After the H1N1 swine flu of 2009, the ASO3-adjuvanted swine flu vaccine Pandemrix (a fast-tracked vaccine used in Europe but not in the U.S. during 2009-2010) was causally linked9 to childhood narcolepsy, which abruptly skyrocketed in several countries.10 11

Children and teens in Finland,12 the U.K.13 and Sweden14 were among the hardest hit. Further analyses discerned a rise in narcolepsy among adults who received the vaccine as well, although the link wasn’t as obvious as that in children and adolescents.15

A 2019 study16 reported finding a “novel association between Pandemrix-associated narcolepsy and the non-coding RNA gene GDNF-AS1”—a gene thought to regulate the production of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor or GDNF, a protein that plays an important role in neuronal survival.

They also confirmed a strong association between vaccine-induced narcolepsy and a certain haplotype, suggesting “variation in genes related to immunity and neuronal survival may interact to increase the susceptibility to Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy in certain individuals.”

In addition to that, there’s the research17 showing that the H1N1 swine flu vaccine was one of five inactivated vaccines that increased overall mortality, especially among girls. A swine flu article I wrote 11 years ago, in 2009, turned out to have a rather prophetic warning at the end:

The swine flu vaccine has not been tested for safety or efficacy, but we DO know it will contain harmful additives. The choice, to me, is obvious. And in the future, anytime a new ‘pandemic’ appears and officials urge you to rush out and get a shot, please remember this article and ask yourself if it’s really you who stands to benefit from their advice.

The Swine Flu Fraud of 1976

We can also learn from the swine flu fiasco of 1976, detailed in this 1979 60 Minutes episode. Fearing a repeat of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, “the government propaganda machine cranked into action,” 60 Minutes says, telling all Americans to get vaccinated.

According to 60 Minutes, 46 million Americans were vaccinated against the swine flu at that time. Over the next few years, thousands of Americans filed vaccine damage claims with the federal government.18 As reported by Smithsonian Magazine in 2017:19

In the spring of 1976, it looked like that year’s flu was the real thing. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t, and rushed response led to a medical debacle that hasn’t gone away.

“Some of the American public’s hesitance to embrace vaccines—the flu vaccine in particular—can be attributed to the long-lasting effects of a failed 1976 campaign to mass-vaccinate the public against a strain of the swine flu virus,’ writes Rebecca Kreston for Discover.

This government-led campaign was widely viewed as a debacle and put an irreparable dent in future public health initiative, as well as negatively influenced the public’s perception of both the flu and the flu shot in this country.

A 1981 report by the U.S. General Accounting Office to Sen. John Durkin, D-N.H., reads, in part:20

Before the swine flu program there were comparatively few vaccine-related claims made against the Government. Since 1963, Public Health Service records showed that only 27 non-swine flu claims were filed.

However, as of December 31, 1979, we found that 3,839 claims and 988 lawsuits had been filed against the Government alleging injury, death, or other damage resulting from the 45 million swine flu immunizations given under the program.

A Justice official told us that as of October 2, 1980, 3,965 claims and 1,384 lawsuits had been filed. Of the 3,965 claims filed, the Justice official said 316 claims had been settled for about $12.3 million …

The devastating side effects of the Pandemrix vaccine should be instructive. No one anticipated a flu vaccine to have genetic consequences, yet it did. Now they’re proposing injecting mRNA to make every single cell in your body produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

It seems outright foolish not to assume there will be significant consequences.

Sound the Shofar of Freedom,"Three times daily we implore G-d in prayer: “Sound the great shofar for our freedom.” As we prepare to sound the shofar and usher in the new Jewish year this Sunday, it’s high time we assess the precarious state of freedom in our present day. In case you haven’t been paying attention, freedom is in serious jeopardy here in the United States and around the world.

Fear and dread are historic ways with which tyrants have exploited populations to willingly cede their freedoms. Pandemic panic and pandemonium have recently accomplished just that. Quicker than you can say “social distancing,” government has already begun to encroach on our precious freedoms in ways hitherto unimaginable.

Without any strict scrutiny, the state has shut down our houses of worship, banned our gatherings, violated our bodily autonomy, forcing masks on our faces, all without providing a shred of scientific evidence that asymptomatic carriers pose significant risk to anyone. And they are poised to do much more… brace yourselves for adult vaccine mandates.

Truth be told, this sort of medical tyranny is not without precedent. For years, government has enforced a mandatory vaccine policy on school-age children while we were asleep at the wheel. They threw us a doggy bone. “Religious exemption” was the paltry concession prize we were “benevolently” rewarded for tolerating their benign despotism. And in recent months and years, just before the Wuhan virus was unleashed, states began to take back these religious exemptions, by default forcing all children to comply with their mandated vaccine policies without exception.

Of course, the state had no right to meddle with religious freedom, since the First Amendment was inviolable to begin with. In past articles,1 2 3 I’ve lamented the grave injustice of vaccine mandates altogether.

In the spirit of sounding the Shofar of freedom, let’s make it known to all that Judaism strongly advocates medical choice. Vaccination must be a choice. It may not be coerced. If you want 99 percent vaccination compliance, move to Communist China. It’s unattainable here in Land of the Free. If you are so panic-stricken by disease, perhaps you shouldn’t live in a free society where bodily autonomy and First Amendment rights are sacrosanct.

China might be a better fit for you. They enforce compulsory vaccination with no exceptions, so you’ll feel right at home. They tend to force-sterilize people too, but hey, as long as you’re not an Muslim Uighur or some political dissident, and you only have one child, you should be just fine.

Some have asked me: “Does that mean you want measles to return?” My response: Not necessarily, but I’d prefer a return to measles of the fifties any day before submitting to medical dictatorship. I don’t want disease. I just want freedom. But if freedom comes with a price tag that includes increased risk of any particular disease, then so be it. Tyranny is far more dangerous to humanity than any microbe ever was. Give me freedom or give me death.

I simply yearn to breathe free. I do not wish to be part of a new huddled masses in my own country, marginalized and persecuted by an all-powerful pharmaceutical lobby driven by its insatiable profit margins. No, I do not want your medical bondage. Nope, I will not join you in your dependency on pharmaceutical products. I will not accept anything less than freedom. Freedom to choose what I put into my body.

Freedom from dubious ingredients like: glyphosates

fluoride

aluminum adjuvants

thimerosal mercury

dna from murdered human beings in a cruel procedure of live dissection,

substances that carry risks of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, infertility

substances that haven’t been evaluated for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, infertility

… to name a few, and many more morally objectionable ingredients that I never consented to.

If I am forced to choose, I prefer natural dangers to man-made ones. As King David observed (and we cite in the Selichot liturgy): “I am greatly oppressed; let us fall now into the hand of G-d; for His mercies are great; but into the hand of man let me not fall.” (Samuel II 24:14) — נִפְּלָה נָּא בְיַד ה’ כִּי רַבִּים רַחֲמָיו וּבְיַד אָדָם אַל אֶפֹּלָה

So while I might applaud researchers’ efforts to develop a safe vaccine for a coronavirus or any virus, I will oppose a mandate with every fiber of my being. And so should you, if you cherish freedom. Sound the Shofar and let freedom ring.

Major Protests in Berlin and London Opposing Forced Masking and...,"Responding to big public demonstrations in Berlin and London against forced masking, “social distancing” and lockdown laws that have torn apart the economic and social fabric of European societies, mainstream media outlets described the tens of thousands of people who attended the gatherings as “covid-deniers,”1 2 and “conspiracy theorists and far-right groups.”3 Most of the people of all ages, who made the trip to Berlin and London and to similar smaller demonstrations in Paris, Copenhagen, Vienna and Zurich, rejected the “extreme right wing sympathizer” label and described themselves as protesting to defend “fundamental freedoms.”4 Holding signs that said, “No lockdowns,” and “Masks are muzzles” and “End medical tyranny,” and “No to mandatory vaccines,” the common theme of the protests in every European city was freedom from government restrictions on social interaction and the elimination of civil liberties.

The Berlin demonstration was held near the Reichstag building, which houses the German parliament (Bundestag), and in front of the iconic 18th century Brandenburg Gate. According to Reuters, the Berlin demonstration drew “around 38,000 protesters,”5 although photos and estimates from those attending the demonstration indicated the crowd size was at least two to three times larger. The International Business Times reported the crowd size in Berlin was “around 18,000” people.6 At the same time, Reuters reported that the London “Unite for Freedom” rally drew only a “few hundred” when photos and video from the London event show Trafalgar Square overflowing with thousands of protesters.7 8

German Government Tightens COVID-19 Restrictions

In March 2020 after the World Health Organization declared a global coronavirus pandemic, Germany instituted among the strictest lockdowns in Europe, closing shops, restaurants and schools, banning large gatherings of people and initiating widespread testing, which appeared at the beginning to keep COVID-19 mortality low. Social interaction restrictions were eventually eased in late spring but a reported rise in infections this summer has prompted German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has a doctorate in Science from the German Academy of Sciences in Berlin, East Germany, to introduce “tougher restrictions,” including limits on travel. Merkel has warned that the pandemic was “likely to get more difficult in the coming months” and that society “is never going to be the same” until a vaccine is developed.9

There is now a ban in Germany on large gatherings until the end of the year and mandatory COVID-19 testing at airports and ports for all travelers arriving from “high risk” countries. Germans can be fined a minimum fine of 50 euros ($78) for failing to wear a face covering in shops or on public transport.10

Berlin Officials Tried to Ban Anti-Lockdown Demonstration

The German government tried to ban the Aug. 29 demonstration in Berlin, citing the need for “protection from infection”11 and the lack of masking and social distancing during a “Day of Freedom” demonstration in Berlin on Aug. 1.12 Germany’s State Minister of the Interior of Berlin said, “We need to weigh the basic right of freedom of assembly against the sanctity of life. We chose life.”13 However, a German court ruled 24 hours before the event that the demonstration could go forward as long as protesters adhered to a “hygiene plan.”

According to the Daily Mail Online, “as many as 3,000 police officers” were deployed in Berlin to disperse protesters after they failed to wear masks and maintain social distancing. Reportedly, the Berlin police explained on Twitter that ”Unfortunately, we have no other option,” because the protesters had not complied with the “safety” conditions of the march.14 Between 200 and 300 protesters were arrested outside the Russian Embassy and when they tried to get into the Reichstag building and threw stones and bottles.15

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr Addresses Berlin Protesters

The majority of the Berlin protesters gathered peacefully west of the Brandenburg Gate at the Victory Column to listen to speeches, organized by the Stuttgart-based movement Querdenken 711 (or Lateral Thinking 711). The BBC said the group “believes that coronavirus regulations infringe on basic rights and freedoms enshrined in Germany’s constitution and wants them to be lifted.”16

Among the speakers was Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., founder and chair of Children’s Health Defense. The nephew of U.S. President John F Kennedy, RFK, Jr. recalled how his uncle had famously addressed the residents of west Berlin in 1963 after the Berlin Wall was built to stop people escaping from the totalitarian communist-controlled East Berlin in search of freedom.

Kennedy told the enthusiastic crowd that he–and they–are being painted as “Nazis” by the mainstream media because they are defending freedom and open government. He said,17

Back home in the United States the newspapers are saying that I came here today to speak to about 5,000 Nazis. And tomorrow, they’re going to report that I was here at I spoke to maybe three to 5,000 Nazis. I look at this crowd and I see the opposite of Nazism. I see people who love democracy. People who want open government. People who want leaders who are not going to lie to them, leaders who will not make up arbitrary rules and regulations ordering strict obedience by the population. We want health officials who don’t have financial entanglements with the pharmaceutical industry, who are working for us and not Big Pharma. We want officials who care about our children’s health and not about pharmaceutical profits or government control.

Most European Union Governments Have Taken a Hard Line

By Mar. 23, 2020, Great Britain had passed legislation that gave government officials the power to severely restrict the freedom of individuals, imposing strict lockdown measures. People were prohibited from going outside of their homes except to go food shopping, exercise (alone), see a doctor or provide care to another person in need. Meeting with other people, even family members or close friends, for any other reason was prohibited. People vulnerable to coronavirus infection were asked to shelter in place for 12 weeks. All bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants were closed, as well as all schools and childcare facilities, except for the children of workers considered to be essential.18 Social distancing between people was set at two metres (approximately six feet).

The majority of national lockdown measures started to be eased in England at the start of July and people were allowed to meet each other indoors, while social distancing was reduced to three or more feet (one meter plus). A large number of businesses also reopened. According to Wired Magazine, on August 8, the rules governing face masking were expanded from all public transportation to people going inside museums, places of worship, shops, hotels, beauty salons, offices and other indoor public spaces. The police have the power enforce mask wearing in shops and fine people £100 for refusing to wear a mask and a shop can refuse maskless people entry and call the police if someone refuses to wear a mask.19

France’s coronavirus lockdown began in mid-March and by mid-May restrictions were eased. However, face masking in public for anyone age 11 or older is mandatory and there are stiff fines for those who refuse to mask. Beginning Sept. 1, all employees in all workplaces will be required to wear masks if they share office space.20

Spain also has compulsory mask wearing in public spaces regardless of whether people are outside alone or social distancing is possible. There is a ban on social gatherings of more than 10 people, and military personnel are helping health officials with contact tracing in some parts of Spain.

Italy’s strict lockdown started on Mar. 7, 2020 and gradually eased two months later with the opening of public places but with social distancing and compulsory face mask wearing regulations. However, in August there was in increase in reported infections and the government ordered the closure of all dance halls and nightclubs, including outdoor venues, and there is mandatory face masking in all public spaces where social distancing is not possible.

In Belgium, there was a reopening of shops, schools, hair salons, as well as tourist attractions, in May with public gatherings of 200 to 400 allowed since July. However, after a rise in reported infections in August, new regulations requiring face masking in all public areas have been instituted and police checks are increasing to ensure that people follow the rules. Some cities have instituted curfews, and restaurants are limiting four people to a table, while nightclubs remain closed and no festivals or other large events are allowed.

In the Netherlands, on July 1 the government lifted restrictions on how many people could be inside or outside shops and other public venues provided they kept about 5 feet away from each other. When the rates of reported infections started to climb in August, new restrictions closing cafes, cinemas, museums and amusement parks in case of an outbreak and local authorities can impose additional measures, including curfews

Sweden Refused to Lockdown

Unlike the United Kingdom, Germany and other European nations, Sweden decided to take a different approach to the novel coronavirus pandemic and encourage hand washing and social distancing, when possible, but did not lockdown its society.21 Shops, restaurants, schools, offices and other public venues did not close, people did not mask and there was no disruption of social interactions or the economy.

There is no “new normal” in Sweden because the Swedish people followed the advice of chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell at Sweden’s Public Health Agency, who advocated for allowing the new coronavirus to spread throughout the population so that natural herd immunity would be achieved. Although Dr. Tegnell acknowledges more could have been done to protect the elderly in Sweden’s nursing homes while population based herd immunity was being acquired, by August it was clear that COVID-19 infection reports were declining rapidly even as cases in other European nations that had instituted strict lockdowns were rising.22 23

It is understandable why people living in Europe are holding public demonstrations challenging the scientific and political rationale for the institution of oppressive lockdowns that have restricted or eliminated civil liberties and have had severe economic and social consequences this year. The anti-lockdown protests in Berlin, London and other large European cities this past weekend are the beginning of a new public questioning of government officials that will continue until they provide good answers that make sense.

How is Coronavirus Getting Into the Brain?,"Recently, studies have been published suggesting a link between the SARS-CoV-2 virus, brain inflammation and neurological dysfunction. One study involving 60 patients who recovered from COVID-19, for example, found that 55 percent of them displayed “structural changes” in the brain that manifested with loss of memory and smell for three months. The study, published in The Lancet on Aug. 3, 2020, found evidence that the SARS-CoV virus had invaded the olfactory epithelium—tissue within the human nasal cavity that play a role in the ability to smell.1 2

The encyclopedia Britannica describes the olfactory epithelium as containing “olfactory receptor cells, which have specialized cilia extensions.” It explains that the “cilia trap odor molecules as they pass across the epithelial surface” and that [i]nformation about the molecules is then transmitted from the receptors to the olfactory bulb in the brain.”3

Studies Link SARS-CoV-2 to Changes in Brain

According to the results of The Lancet study, “significant enlarged volumes [of the SARS-CoV-2 virus] were observed in the bilateral olfactory cortices, hippocampi, insulas, left Heschl’s gyrus, left Rolandic operculum and right cingulate gyrus”—”structures” that make up the “central olfactory system.” However, the study was unable to ascertain how the virus managed to infect the olfactory epithelium.1 The study noted:

Several possible invasion routes of SARS-CoV-2 were raised including hematogenous, lymphatic and neuro retrograde routes, etc., yet the exact route was unknown.1

In another study published in the journal Brain on July 8, 2020, researchers at University College London (UCL) examined 43 cases of COVID-19 in which the patients suffered from a high incidence of “acute disseminated encephalomyelitis”—severe brain inflammation. This resulted in “temporary brain dysfunction, strokes, nerve damage or other serious brain effects.” Nine of the patients were diagnosed with a rare condition known as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).4 5

Dr. Michael Zandi, a consulting neurologist at UCL’s National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, said:

We’re seeing things in the way COVID-19 affects the brain that we haven’t seen before with other viruses. What we’ve seen with some of these ADEM patients, and in other patients, is you can have severe neurology, you can be quite sick, but actually have trivial lung disease.6 7

In a report published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Apr. 15, 2020, a team of physicians said they observed 58 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Strasbourg, France and found that 84 percent of them had neurological symptoms, including “encephalopathy, prominent agitation and confusion, and corticospinal tract signs” and also “acute ischemic strokes.”8 9

Among all these studies, none has pinpointed just how the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have entered the brain. One possible route, though, could be the olfactory nerve in the nose, which is considered to be the first cranial nerve or C1. It is one of 12 cranial nerves in the head. The C1 leads into the olfactory epithelium and itsolfactory receptors are located in the mucosa of the nasal cavity—essentially your nose.3 8

Olfactory Nerve: Nose a ‘Shortcut” for Viruses Entering the Brain

In January 2015, a study titled “The olfactory nerve: a shortcut for influenza and other viral diseases into the central nervous system” was published in the journal Pathology.9 That study found that…

Viral infection of the [central nervous system] can lead to damage from infection of nerve cells per se, from the immune response, or from a combination of both. Clinical consequences range from nervous dysfunction in the absence of histopathological changes to severe meningoencephalitis and neurodegenerative disease.9

The study listed viruses that can use the olfactory nerve as a “shortcut” into the brain. Viruses that enter the body through the nose include influenza A virus, herpesviruses, poliovirus, paramyxoviruses (like RSV, measles, mumps), vesicular stomatitis virus, rabies virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, La Crosse virus, mouse hepatitis virus and bunyaviruses.9

The 2015 Pathology study obviously made no mention of SARS-CoV-2 since that virus was not known then. But if all those other viruses can enter the brain via the nose and olfactory nerve, then might it not be possible for SARS-CoV-2 as well?

Neurosurgeon Russell Blaylock, MD referenced the olfactory nerve as a route into the brain in a recent article in Technology News & Trends. Citing a 1989 study in the journal Virology titled “Spread of a neurotropic murine coronavirus into the [central nervous system] via the trigeminal and olfactory nerves,”10 11 Dr. Blaylock wrote:

In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves (smell nerves), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.10

CDC Data Suggest Lockdowns Could Kill As Many People As COVID,"COVID has clearly been devastating. But our reaction has turned a bad pandemic into an unrivaled self-inflicted national disaster.

by Karl Dierenbach

Three-hundred-fifty years ago, John Graunt attempted to give Londoners an accurate assessment of fatality rates of diseases in the community so people could understand their risk level. Until COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) fulfilled the same role.

Then the CDC abandoned tradition and sensibility and treated COVID differently than every other disease. For a death to be considered a COVID death, COVID no longer needed to be the immediate or underlying cause of death. Now, a death is considered a COVID death even if COVID was only a contributing condition.

For example, a certificate that lists dementia as the cause of death but doesn’t list a respiratory ailment is likely to be a case of dying with COVID, not from COVID. Likewise for accidents, heart attacks, strokes, and any other non-respiratory condition.

Singapore, for example, only counts deaths as COVID deaths if they are accompanied by pneumonia. If the United States followed this criterion, COVID deaths would total about 90,000 and be comparable to a very bad flu season.

To disentangle respiratory COVID deaths from other types of COVID deaths requires examining individual death records, which are difficult to obtain. Fortunately, in May, Florida released data on 1,489 COVID deaths. About two-thirds of those deaths that listed more than just COVID as a cause also listed a respiratory condition.

Applying this two-thirds estimate to the current official tally of 240,000 U.S. COVID deaths yields a very rough estimate of 160,000 deaths from COVID.

Remarkably, this number represents about half of the approximately 300,000 excess deaths the United States has experienced this year, according to the CDC’s latest estimate dated Oct. 3. The 300,000 number is determined by subtracting the 2,240,000 fatalities the CDC estimates we would expect to have seen from January to October if 2020 were a typical year from the 2,540,000 deaths we have actually suffered.

This begs the question: What is causing the remaining 140,000 excess deaths?

Although CDC records are far from comprehensive, they do provide some explanation: So far in 2020, the CDC data shows there have been about 32,000 excess Alzheimer’s deaths and 12,000 excess diabetes deaths.

The Alzheimer’s deaths are particularly heart-wrenching, as these represent people literally dying from loneliness and lack of human interaction. The excess diabetes deaths could be due to the interruption of normal health-care operations.

There are many other documented and postulated sources of excess deaths, including delayed emergency room visits due to fear of COVID resulting in postponed or skipped treatment for heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and other ailments. Deaths of despair, such as suicides and drug overdoses, have increased.

Violence has also increased significantly. Additionally, the CDC recently reported an unprecedented 26.5 percent surge in deaths for adults aged 25–44, a group for which COVID is no worse than the flu.

In addition, as the 13,000 medical expert authors and signers of the Great Barrington Declaration point out, the deaths and diseases the lockdowns are creating will continue for years. The excess deaths toll from the effects of lockdowns will continue to accrue even as COVID dissipates.

In total, for every COVID death, we could ultimately tally another death from our reaction to COVID. Why is this happening? Why have we treated COVID like no other disease in history?

Watching Democrats attempting to blame the epidemic on President Trump, one cannot escape the sense of political motivation. Joe Biden made such claims even though COVID had devastated countries all over the world. Recently, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) sounded like an anti-vaxxer, saying he is skeptical of a vaccine recommended by Trump.

This hasn’t even touched on the damage our reaction has done to jobs, the economy, and the education of millions of children and young adults. Moreover, missed health-care screenings and interruption of economic activity will have damaging effects for years to come.

This is all not to say that COVID is a hoax or it’s not that bad. COVID has clearly been devastating and, even at 160,000 deaths so far as adjusted above, it is twice as bad as the worst flu seasons in recent memory. But our reaction has turned a bad pandemic into an unrivaled self-inflicted, full-scale national disaster.

In the end, it won’t be COVID, but our reaction to it, that will go down as the most deadly and damaging event of 2020.",11/13/20 0:00,,0
How Mainstream Media Fear-Mongers Misrepresent COVID-19,"Today, like yesterday and tomorrow, news outlets will announce the number of new COVID-19 cases. “Cases,” in this case, will be the number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 since yesterday’s announcement.

In the spirit of accentuate the negative and eliminate the positive, the number of people who tested negative for COVID-19 will not be announced.

This matters because 300 new cases out of 3,000 tests is an alarming number, but 300 new cases out of 30,000 tests, while a cause for concern, is not alarming. In this case, as in most cases, context is what enables us to think about a number. Numerators without denominators are seldom informative.

Today, like yesterday and tomorrow, news outlets will also announce the new number of COVID-19 deaths, along with the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 to date.

Here again, context is needed. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has a bevy of competent and careful counters. Those epidemiologists take the time that is necessary to gather the statistics required to make reliable estimates.

As such, the number of deaths caused by the 2017–18 seasonal flu is the most recently finalized estimate for influenza deaths in the United States: 61,099. We had a vaccine for that flu, and about 37 percent of adults were vaccinated.

The vaccine was about 38 percent effective. So it is reasonable to guess that if we had not had a vaccine for the 2017–18 flu, its mortality figure would have been about 69,690.

Accordingly, if COVID-19 was only as inherently lethal as the 2017–18 seasonal flu, because we did not have a vaccine for COVID-19, its mortality figure would be about 69,690. So if the two viruses reached those projected death tolls independently, we would expect about 130,789 deaths.

Fear-mongering can be lucrative. Bad news grabs readers’ attention and enables testing companies to reap unprecedented profits — but only if context is not allowed to dampen enthusiasm for accentuating the negative.

Unfortunately, we have surpassed 200,000 deaths. In the spirit of if-it-bleeds-it-leads, however, media sensationalism attributes all possibly-COVID-19 deaths to COVID-19. This is news outlet overkill.

The CDC is careful to specify that its mortality graphs combine deaths from Pneumonia with flu-like symptoms, deaths from Influenza (seasonal flu), and deaths from COVID-19. They call that combination “Deaths due to PIC” (see Figure 1 below).

In early 2020, patients who died from pneumonia with flu-like symptoms were seldom tested for seasonal flu or COVID-19. When COVID-19 testing became widely available, patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were seldom also tested for seasonal flu.

There was an alarming spike in PIC deaths during March and April 2020. An unknown number of those fatalities were patients who could have survived the seasonal flu or COVID-19 alone, but could not survive simultaneous infection with both viruses.

The important context here is an unknown number. It tells us to be skeptical. News outlets also announce absolute national death totals instead of per capita deaths.

Those numerators without denominators will keep the United States in first place for COVID-19 attributed deaths — ahead of Brazil, even though Brazil is ahead of the United States in per capita deaths. So in addition to being uninformative, numerators without denominators can be deceptive.

Fear-mongering can be lucrative. Bad news grabs readers’ attention and enables testing companies to reap unprecedented profits — but only if context is not allowed to dampen enthusiasm for accentuating the negative.

For example, even if U.S. deaths due to PIC top 400,000 in 2020, whether COVID-19 without serious comorbidities caused the vast majority of those deaths or only the largest portion, those deaths should be considered in the context of the size of the U.S. population (about 328 million) and the number of deaths otherwise expected this year (about 2.8 million). In the context of those denominators, PIC deaths are a real concern, but they are not catastrophic.

As put by Michael Barone,

the 1957-58 Asian flu killed between 75,000 and 116,000 people in the United States, between 0.04% and 0.07% of the nation’s population then. The 1968-69 Hong Kong flu killed about 100,000, 0.05% of the population.

The current [Covid-19] death toll of 185,000 is 0.055% of the current population. It will go higher, but it’s about the same magnitude as those two flu outbreaks and less deadly for those under 65.

Yet, there were no statewide lockdowns, no massive school closings, no closed office buildings and factories, restaurants, and museums. No one even considered shutting down Woodstock.

As of 2018, about 700,000 people have died from HIV/AIDS, and about 655,000 people die from heart disease while about 140,000 die from stroke each year in the United States.

Even though stroke and heart disease are not contagious, their combined 795,000 deaths will swamp reasonable projections for COVID-19 deaths – but still, the effect of deaths from stroke, heart disease, and HIV/ AIDS has not been catastrophic because combating those illnesses has not entailed policies that cause massive unemployment, divert health care from other lethal illnesses, and raise the specter of economic collapse. Three hundred and twenty eight million is a big denominator.

Given a concerning-but-not-catastrophic PIC pandemic, public health responses also need to be kept in proper perspective. Wrong context is even worse than no context.

Erring on the side of caution, the CDC decided to advise more stringent strategies than might have been appropriate – identifying and isolating patients, requiring social distancing, economic and social lockdowns, compulsory mask wearing, maybe even tracing contacts, et cetera — many of the strategies that helped defeat Ebola virus epidemics.

Sounds good, but there are two problems. The first is feasibility of enforcement. China’s government has the power over its provinces and people to enforce lockdowns and quarantine major cities like Wuhan (11 million people).

The United States is not that “united.” We have states’ rights. Even states whose governors try to isolate their state from other states find that their policies have more holes than a sieve. A country that champions “Give me liberty, or give me death” and “Live free or die” cannot enforce strictures that could work in theory.

Feasibility of enforcement aside, there is an epidemiological hitch that cannot be overcome even in theory. Compared to coronaviruses (common cold, COVID-19) and influenza viruses (flu), Ebola is super-lethal. Super-lethal means that victims do not live long enough to become asymptomatic long-term carriers. But with COVID-19 we have asymptomatic regular-spreaders, silent spreaders, and super-spreaders.

So when new cases and deaths decrease below pandemic levels in areas where CDC recommendations have been largely observed, and those areas begin to “open up” in response, non-immune people who come out of lockdown are at high risk of being infected by a plethora of highly mobile carriers.

This phenomenon drives what is often called a “second wave” of Covid-19 (per the second bump in Figures 1 and 3). The term “second wave” can be misleading. The virus does not do anything new. New infections are caused by first exposure of non-immune individuals within a population that was closing in on herd immunity.

Herd immunity is both a reality and a mystery. Plants can signal surrounding conspecifics when an infectious agent is on its way, enabling signal receivers to mount preemptive defenses that do not involve antibodies. Perhaps it is rash to assume that animals, including humans, have not evolved analogous signaling capacities.

Either way, we need to keep an open mind about unknown immunity mechanisms. Common colds and seasonal flus spread like wildfire, then decline asymptotically toward zero. The viruses involved are not naturally selected to become less infectious, but only a minority of potential victims suffer symptoms before herd immunity works its magic. The phenomenon of herd immunity tells us to be skeptical about how much we really understand.

In Sweden, where the stringency of government responses to COVID-19 has been substantially less than government responses in the U.S. (see Figure 2 below), herd immunity appears to have been accomplished at the end of August while the U.S. appears to be months away from herd immunity (see Figure 3 below).

Projecting U.S. deaths forward on Figure 3 strongly suggests that in addition to taking longer to reach herd immunity than Sweden, the U.S. per capita death total will be significantly higher than Sweden’s.

“I told you so!” would be a justifiable response from Swedes, but instead they have built the most copiously and transparently sourced, interactive, appropriately caveated, and informative worldwide COVID-19 tracking website available.

In Africa, where the stringency of government responses to COVID-19 has often been even less than Sweden’s, the continent “seems to have weathered the pandemic relatively well so far,” raising “the controversial idea of letting the virus run its course to allow the population to become immune,” according to Science magazine.

Letting the virus run its course was recently advocated by dozens of Israeli physicians and scientists:

“A lockdown does not stop the pandemic, it merely slows its spread slightly and temporarily … When the restrictions are lifted, the virus continues its spread, and this after the country’s citizens have been weakened emotionally, economically and above all in terms of their health.

“A lockdown does not prevent deaths. On the contrary, it extends the period of time during which populations at risk are exposed to the virus … thus paradoxically causing excess mortality.”

Again, responses that are appropriate for Ebola are not appropriate for COVID-19 because of the difference in asymptomatic carrier prevalence.

Indeed, slowing the spread of a disease does not always mean reducing the spread of a disease. Put differently, a curve can be flattened (e.g., the peak can be pushed down, like the U.S. peak relative to the Swedish peak in Figure 3) without reducing the area under the curve.

Sometimes slowing the spread of a disease means that the same number of people need to become immune before herd immunity is acquired, such that slowing disease spread slows acquisition of herd immunity.

Nevertheless, slowing disease spread prevents hospitals in densely populated areas from being overwhelmed, and allows more time for the development of improved treatments and possibly a vaccine — a tool that boosts herd immunity and should always be used when available.

So slowing the spread of a disease that requires the same percentage of immune individuals to reach herd immunity can mean fewer deaths from that disease per se.

COVID-19 may be an example, but the number of lives saved by flattening the COVID-19 curve seems likely to be fewer than the number of deaths caused by the CDC’s well-intentioned recommendations. Data from Sweden and parts of Africa suggest that caring for the sick as we do with seasonal flus, but otherwise letting a coronavirus “run its course” may have been a wiser strategy.

Public health responses to COVID-19 that are more appropriate for Ebola can cause response overkill. Federal, state, and municipal response overkill has the potential to turn an inherently non-catastrophic virus into a catastrophe.

If that happens, when COVID-19 finally becomes a not-fond memory, the more wizened among us will not be surprised to hear government officials take credit for having defeated the pandemic with their stringent responses — having conquered the catastrophe that they created.

The next time a news outlet tells you how many people tested positive for COVID-19, submit a reader comment asking how many people tested negative.

Sometimes a good question unmasks a half-asked, half-assed answer. In addition to demanding good news that puts bad news into context, we need to retain a healthy skepticism toward cures that may be worse than the disease.

"30,000+ Health Experts Sign Declaration Opposing Covid-19 Lockdowns","Tens of thousands of health practitioners, scientists and other medical experts have signed a declaration opposing any further Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) lockdowns.

by Ethan Huff

Co-authored by Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a Harvard University professor and epidemiologist with expertise in detecting and monitoring infectious disease; Dr. Sunetra Gupta, a University of Oxford professor and epidemiologist with expertise in immunology; and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University professor and epidemiologist who specializes in infectious disease and vulnerable populations, the petition has one simple request: end the lockdowns.

“Coming from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people,” the Great Barrington Declaration, named after the Massachusetts town where it was authored on Oct. 4, explains.

“Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short- and long-term public health.”

Forcing people to stay at home and avoid others is causing a spike in chronic illness and death, the petition contends.

Cardiovascular disease outcomes are worsening, fewer people are getting screened for cancer, vaccination rates are on the decline – this one is a good thing – and mental health is deteriorating, among many other disastrous outcomes.

“Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice,” the petition goes on to explain.

Rather than shut things down, governments – or more accurately, We the People – need to open everything back up and pursue “herd” immunity, much in the same way as Sweden did.

This will ensure that people are no longer being harmed by the “cure” for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), which is doing far more damage than good.

“Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing,” the declaration states.

“We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young.”

“Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza,” it adds.

Compassion is allowing people to live their lives, not forcing them to stay holed up forever

Signed by more than 32,000 medical doctors and health scientists from around the world – you know, the types of people that support science – the declaration aims to protect the most vulnerable populations while also supporting the God-given right of everyone else to “resume life as normal” rather than be forced to “protect the vulnerable” with draconian restrictions on movement and civil liberties.

These are the latest survival rate estimates from the Center for Disease Control:

Age 0-19 … 99.997%

Age 20-49 … 99.98%

Age 50-69 … 99.5%

Age 70+ … 94.6%

Source: CDC.gov

“The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk,” the declaration further states.

A better way to help the vulnerable would be to minimize staff rotations at nursing homes, for instance, as well as deliver groceries and other essential items to retired people who live at home.

Basic hygiene, just as we have long been doing, is another healthy habit that will help to protect those most at risk of infection.

“Arts, music, sport, and other cultural activities should resume,” the declaration further says, noting that young, low-risk adults should be allowed to work as normal outside the home.

Schools, it also says, should open back up as normal, as should sports.

“People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity,” it concludes.

It is also important to remember that the goal was never to eliminate the virus completely, but rather to “flatten the curve” and prevent an overload of health care facilities.

Now that this has been accomplished, it is time to end the plandemic and move on with our lives.",10/30/20 0:00,,0
Globalist Klaus Schwab: World Will ‘Never’ Return to Normal After COVID Despite Him Admitting That Coronavirus ‘Doesn’t Pose a New Existential Threat’,"In his book Covid-19: The Great Reset, World Economic Forum globalist Klaus Schwab asserts that the world will “never” return to normal, despite him admitting that coronavirus “doesn’t pose a new existential threat.”

Breitbart’s James Delingpole unveils how Schwab is even more explicit in his book about the elite’s plan for exploiting the COVID pandemic than in his public statements.

Schwab has continually pushed for COVID to be exploited to push for a new world order, claiming:

“Now is the historical moment of time not only to fight the… virus but to shape the system… for the post-corona era.”

However, he goes further in the book, making it clear that the financial elite will never allow life to return to normal, suggesting that rolling lockdowns and other restrictions will become permanent:

“Many of us are pondering when things will return to normal,” writes Schwab.

“The short response is: never. Nothing will ever return to the ‘broken’ sense of normalcy that prevailed prior to the crisis because the coronavirus pandemic marks a fundamental inflection point in our global trajectory.”

The globalist makes this assertion despite admitting that the threat posed by COVID pales in comparison to previous pandemics.

“Unlike certain past epidemics, COVID-19 doesn’t pose a new existential threat,” he writes.

Schwab makes clear that the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ or ‘The Great Reset’ will fundamentally change how the world operates.

“Radical changes of such consequence are coming that some pundits have referred to as ‘before coronavirus’ (BC) and ‘after coronavirus’ (AC) era.

“We will continue to be surprised by both the rapidity and unexpected nature of these changes – as they conflate with each other, they will provoke second-, third-, fourth- and more-order consequences, cascading effects and unforeseen outcomes,” he writes.

As Delingpole explains in his column, “The Great Reset” merely represents a re-packaging of the old globalist agenda which has been stuttering over the last decade.

Namely, technocratic dictatorial rule by a tiny elite, the “green new deal,” the gradual abolition of private property, a guaranteed minimum wage that will see jobs replaced by robots, a crackdown on personal liberties and curtailing freedom of movement.

As we previously highlighted, the idea that the world will never return to normal post-COVID is being pushed by the establishment across the board.

A senior U.S. Army official said that mask wearing and social distancing will become permanent, while CNN’s international security editor Nick Paton Walsh asserted that the mandatory wearing of masks will become “permanent,” “just part of life,” and that the public would need to “come to terms with it.”

CA Doctor Has 100% Cure Rate for Over 1700 COVID Patients Using Hydroxychloroquine,"While the media continues pushing hype around the coronavirus, actual medical experts say we already have the tools we need to combat the virus.

One America’s Pearson Sharp spoke with Brian Tyson, a doctor in Southern California who has successfully treated over 1,700 patients with the drug hydroxychloroquine.

Doctors on the “front lines” treating COVID patients continue to try and speak out regarding the fact that there is a 100% cure rate for COVID by using hydroxychloroquine.

Dr. Brian Tyson from Southern California is one of the latest doctors to grant an interview talking about his experience in treating over 1700 COVID patients using hydroxychloroquine. None of his patients have died, and only one had to be admitted to the hospital.

This continues to be the biggest scandal of the COVID plandemic, and perhaps the largest scandal in medical history, where so many people are dying needlessly based on a positive COVID test and fear, as this information is censored in the corporate media as well as Big Tech social media platforms.

Even President Trump, who originally promoted hydroxychloroquine and allegedly was taking it himself, has now turned his back on the Front Line doctors who continue to successfully use hydroxychloroquine.

With his own alleged COVID diagnosis last week, President Trump instead chose to use and promote two new drugs that are being fast-tracked and are without a history of successful treatment yet.

"Dr. Ngozi Ezike: ‘If You Die of a Clear Alternative Cause, It’s Still Listed As A COVID Death’","We live in a world full of conflicting information, not to mention a digital authoritarian “fact-checker” that is labelling news that is well sourced as “false” if it’s a narrative that seems to threaten the one that’s beamed out by mainstream media.

Not only is information being heavily censored these days, but so are opinions. One example I recently wrote about was Dr. Ron Paul, who had his opinion on the coronavirus pandemic deemed “fake.”

How can an opinion be fake? What’s really going on here? Why are independent media outlets being censored, demonetized and flagged? Why are people like Julian Assange in jail?

When it comes to the deaths that have been caused by COVID-19, mainstream media points out that “Many experts believe the number of deaths linked to the novel coronavirus in the U.S. is likely higher than the figures available — due to factors such as an insufficient number of tests and inconsistent reporting across locales.”

According to Factcheck.org, “One Facebook user has claimed the opposite, erroneously suggesting the count is being inflated by unrelated deaths, and copies of that claim have gone viral on the social media platform” and the idea that deaths are being miscalculated and in the opposite direction of what mainstream media is claiming, is false.

They point out that “The CDC advises that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 — or, if a test isn’t available, “if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.” It further indicates that if a “definitive diagnosis cannot be made … but it is suspected or likely … it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed.”

New York State recently added 3700 people to the deaths recorded from COVID19 because they were presumed, none of them were tested at all for the virus. (source)

Read: UK’s ‘Daily’ Covid19 Updates Cannot Be Trusted – MSM Lies Exposed With Official Numbers

But what are other experts saying? While some, as illustrated above, believe that the number of deaths linked to the virus, more specifically in the U.S. is likely higher, others believe that it’s actually lower.

For example, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, recently pointed out that all people who pass away and test positive for COVID-19, regardless of the cause of death, means that the death will be marked as a COVID-19 death. Would this not add a number of deaths to the COVID-19 death count unnecessarily? What we are being told is that if someone dies of a heart attack, for example, it may be counted as a COVID-19 death.

According to Ezike,

“If you were in hospice and had already been given a few weeks to live and then you were also found to have COVID, that would be counted as COVID death, despite if you died of a clear alternative cause it’s still listed as a COVID death. So, everyone who is listed as a COVID death that doesn’t mean that was the cause of the death, but they had COVID at the time of death.” (source)

She makes it quite clear that all deaths that have been listed as a COVID death may have not been caused by COVID, and this is a point that seems to be ignored by mainstream media, while they push the other narrative that COVID deaths may actually be higher as many go unreported.

This could also be the case. Who knows? Perhaps it’s a mix of both? At the end of the day, discussion, information and evidence should not be shut down and censored. It should be made available for anybody who desires to explore.

Below is some information I’ve compiled and put into previous articles, which are linked at the end of this article. I thought it would be a good idea to re-iterate a bit of it here as it relates.

An article written by John Lee, a recently retired professor of pathology and a former NHS consultant pathologist raises some interesting questions. He published it in The Spectator, and in it he writes:

If someone dies of a respiratory infection in the UK, the specific cause of the infection is not usually recorded, unless the illness is a rare ‘notifiable disease’. So the vast majority of respiratory deaths in the UK are recorded as bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, old age or a similar designation.

We don’t really test for flu, or other seasonal infections. If the patient has, say, cancer, motor neurone disease or another serious disease, this will be recorded as the cause of death, even if the final illness was a respiratory infection. This means UK certifications normally under-record deaths due to respiratory infections.

Now look at what has happened since the emergence of Covid-19. The list of notifiable diseases has been updated. This list — as well as containing smallpox (which has been extinct for many years) and conditions such as anthrax, brucellosis, plague and rabies (which most UK doctors will never see in their entire careers) — has now been amended to include Covid-19. But not flu. That means every positive test for Covid-19 must be notified, in a way that it just would not be for flu or most other infections. In the current climate, anyone with a positive test for Covid-19 will certainly be known to clinical staff looking after them: if any of these patients dies, staff will have to record the Covid-19 designation on the death certificate — contrary to usual practice for most infections of this kind. There is a big difference between Covid-19 causing death, and Covid-19 being found in someone who died of other causes. Making Covid-19 notifiable might give the appearance of it causing increasing numbers of deaths, whether this is true or not. It might appear far more of a killer than flu, simply because of the way deaths are recorded. An article recently published by the Financial Times points out, In the UK, about 150,000 people die every year between January and March. To date, the vast majority of those who have died from COVID-19 in Britain have been aged 70 or older or had serious pre-existing health conditions. What is not clear is how many of those deaths would have occurred anyway if the patients had not contracted COVID-19. Speaking at a parliamentary hearing last week, Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said it was not yet clear how many “excess deaths” caused by coronavirus there would be in the UK. However, he said the proportion of COVID-19 victims who would have died anyway could be “as many as half or two-thirds”. An article published in Psychology Today written by Robert Bartholomew Ph.D, points out that, Professor Walter Ricciardi, an advisor to the Italian Health Ministry, observes that the high death rates there may reflect the way that deaths are recorded. “The way in which we code deaths in our country is very generous in the sense that all the people who die … with the coronavirus are deemed to be dying of the coronavirus,” he has said. “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 percent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus, while 88 percent of patients who have died have at least one pre-morbidity—many had two or three” (Newey, 2020). Pre-morbidity refers to having serious health issues prior to the onset of a disease. According to another study out of Italy, 99% of Italy’s coronavirus fatalities that were examined specifically for this study were people who suffered from previous medical conditions. More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease. The study provides inside as to why their death rate may be much higher compared to other countries.

So, as you can see, this is where we are at and the idea that deaths are being miscalculated on the high side as well, is far from fake news.

Infection Rates May Be Much Higher, Driving The Case Fatality Rate Much Lower

Other good news is that the the infection rate, according to multiple studies, is much higher which seems to be driving the case-fatality rate down. A new study by 17 researchers representing Stanford University School of Medicine recently made this point. You can read about that and access that study here.

USC and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health recently released early results from an ongoing study they are conducting on COVID-19. They determined the infection rate in LA is far higher than previously thought. You can read more about that one here.

Flu Shots May Increase COVID-19 Infection Rate by 440% by Suppressing Immune Function,"A new study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases finds that children who received inactivated influenza vaccines were 440% more likely (relative risk: 4.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-14.8) to acquire infections of respiratory viral pathogens which are not influenza.

With the aggressive push for influenza immunizations now under way, the medical establishment may be setting up children to be extremely vulnerable to coronavirus infections.

Titled, “Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine,” the study is found at THIS LINK at the National Library of Medicine.

The study finds that flu shots quite literally inactivate parts of the human immune system, rendering the child more vulnerable to coronavirus infections.

“Being protected against influenza, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine recipients may lack temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses,” the study authors write.

The study authors explain that the influenza vaccine works to prevent influenza virus infections, but at the same time it makes children more susceptible to other respiratory infections.

Since the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for seasonal influenza is so low (around 0.024%, which is not a typo), and the Infection Fatality Rate of covid-19 infections is at least one order of magnitude higher, it raises the obvious question:

Would it save more lives of children to avoid administering flu shots this year and therefore reduce their vulnerability to covid-19, which has a far higher fatality rate?

The study, which was conducted in 2009, observed the outcomes of 115 children aged 6 – 16 years. The study also used a placebo group and found that placebo made “no statistically significant difference” in the risk of acute respiratory infection risk.

But children who received influenza vaccines had a much higher risk of respiratory infections.

Even more shockingly, the study also found no difference in the risk of seasonal influenza infections between those children who were vaccinated vs. those who weren’t.

It’s not the first study to reach this conlcusion: First-Ever Peer-Reviewed Study Of Vaccinated Vs. Unvaccinated Children Shows Vaccinated Kids Have A Higher Rate Of Sickness, 470% Increase In Autism

In other words, the influenza vaccine offered no protection against the flu, but it created increased vulnerability to other respiratory infections. (No benefits, just increased risks.)

“There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influenza infection between recipients of TIV or placebo,” the study explains.

You can see the increased number of respiratory infections in this chart. Note the “TIV” column means those children who were vaccinated with an influenza vaccine:

The conclusion is that influenza vaccines make children more susceptible to other respiratory viral infections. From the study, which took place more than a decade before the arrival of the covid-19 pandemic:

We identified a statistically significant increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection among TIV recipients (Table 3), including significant increases in the risk of rhinovirus and coxsackie/echovirus infection, which were most frequently detected in March 2009, immediately after the peak in seasonal influenza activity in February 2009.

The study authors point out that the influenza vaccine, “could increase influenza immunity at the expense of reduced immunity to noninfluenza respiratory viruses, by some unknown biological mechanism,” although they also state more research is needed because some of the self-reporting of symptoms may have introduced “artifacts” which could sway the numbers.

Nevertheless, the study authors also state that this phenomenon of “viral interference” is well known:

Participants who received TIV would have been protected against influenza in February 2009 but then would not have had heightened nonspecific immunity in the following weeks…

The phenomenon of virus interference has been well known in virology for >60 years [24–27]. Ecological studies have reported phenomena potentially explained by viral interference [3–11]…

Interference in respiratory and gastrointestinal infections has been reported after receipt of live oral poliovirus vaccine [29–32].

Those who push flu shots may be worsening the coronavirus pandemic

The upshot of this research is that those who are pushing flu shots for children may in fact be worsening the coronavirus pandemic, creating “perfect storm” conditions for children to become carriers of the Wuhan coronavirus that causes covid-19.

This is consistent with the fact that we now know the medical establishment has acted to deliberately worsen covid-19 fatalities by, for example, conspiring the destroy the credibility of hydroxychloroquine, working to maximize fatalities in order to reap a windfall of profits from the coronavirus vaccine.

Yes, the medical and science establishment quite literally arranges for more people to die in order to keep the coronavirus fear alive, resulting in more demand for high-profit vaccines.

As always, it’s all about the money. As Gary Heavin recently wrote in a warning to America, Big Pharma operatives are “accessories to murder.”

How does Big Pharma have so much control over the dissemination of this information or should I say propaganda?

Well, the same answer pops up again, money. Big Pharma gave $2 billion dollars during the last election cycle to US politicians.

Big AG, the military/security complex and big oil each gave only a paltry $1.0 billion dollars to buy the votes of our political leadership.

The MSM counts Big Pharma’s advertising revenue at up to 80% of their income.

The internet’s “masters of the universe” also kowtow to Big Pharma’s influence and advertising dollars by censoring anyone who tries to tell the American people the truth about Covid 19.

It certainly appears that anyone who is complicit in this Great Deception, a deception that is designed to kill and terrify enough people to ultimately beg for an experimental vaccine, well, these people would be accessories to murder.

Flu shots are being hyped to suppress immune systems and create an explosion in coronavirus infections

Flu shots, it seems, are one more way the medical establishment can literally murder children and adults, creating widespread vulnerability to the coronavirus pandemic which will no doubt surge back this Fall as flu shots work to suppress the immune systems of millions.

Recognize that the people pushing flu shots are medical murderers, and many are deliberately trying to kill as many people as possible to create demand for the high-profit coronavirus vaccines that are about to be unleashed on America, probably before the end of this year.

It’s the perfect crime: Manufacture vaccines that suppress the immune system right in the middle of a pandemic, causing more infections and deaths, leading to more calls for mandatory vaccines.

The drug companies will cash in to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars while innocent children and adults all across America needlessly suffer and die.

As usual, it’s all about the money, and the vaccine / drug cartels are murderous, criminal regimes that twisted science (Dr. Fauci?) to maximize profits at any cost.",7/13/20 0:00,,0
A Virus is Not a Disease: The Absurdity of Covid ‘Cases’,"Headlines announced Donald and Melania Trump “tested positive” for covid-19. Another claims nineteen thousand Amazon workers “got” covid-19 on the job. Both of these pseudostories are sure to ignite another absurd media frenzy.

As always, the story keeps changing: Remember ventilators, flatten the curve, the next two weeks are crucial, etc.? Remember Nancy Pelosi in Chinatown back in February, urging everyone to visit? Remember Fauci dismissing masks as useless? Why should we believe anything the political/media complex tells us now?

So what do these headlines really mean? What exactly is a covid “case”?

Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, most US media outlets have been exceedingly credulous and complicit in their reporting.

Journalists almost uniformly promote what we can call the “prolockdown” narrative, which is to wildly exaggerate the risks from covid-19 to serve a political agenda.

They may be motivated to hurt Trump politically, to promote a more socialist “new normal,” or simply to drive more clicks and views. Bad news sells. But the bias is clear and undeniable.

This explains why media outlets use the terms “case” and “infection” so loosely, to the point of actively misinforming the public. All of the endless talk about testing, testing, testing served to obscure two important facts.

First, the tests themselves are almost laughably unreliable in producing both false positives and negatives. And what is the point? Are we going to test people again and again, every time they go out to the grocery or bump into a neighbor?

Second, detecting virus particles or droplets in a human’s respiratory tract tells us very little. It certainly does not tell us they are sick, or transmitting sickness to anyone.

Take a perfectly healthy person with no particular symptoms and swab the inside of their nose.

If the culture shows the presence of staphylococcus aureus, do we insist they have a staph infection?

When someone drives to work without incident or accident, do we create statistics about their exposure to traffic?

A virus is not a disease. Only a very small percentage of those exposed to the virus itself — SARS-CoV-2 — show any kind of acute respiratory symptoms, or what we can call “coronavirus disease.”

The only meaningful statistics show the incidence of serious illness, hospitalizations, and deaths.

The single most important statistic among these is the infection fatality rate (IFR). Data collected through July shows that the IFR for those under age forty-five is actually lower than that of the common flu.

The covid-19 IFR rises for those over fifty, but it is hardly a death sentence. And the data does not segregate those with preexisting health issues caused by obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

If we could see data only for reasonably healthy people under fifty, the numbers would be even more reassuring.

Mild or asymptomatic covid cases are effectively meaningless. The world is full of bacteria and viruses, and sometimes they make us a bit sick for a few days.

There are millions of them in the world all around us, on our skin, in our nose and respiratory tract, in our organs.

We are meant to live with them, which is why we all have immune systems designed to help us coexist and adapt to ever-changing organisms.

We develop antibodies naturally, or we attempt to stimulate them through vaccines, but ultimately our own immune systems have to deal with covid-19.

The virus will always be out there waiting, on the other side of any lockdown or mask—so we might as well get on with it.

From day one the focus should have been on boosting immunity through exercise, fresh air, sunlight, proper dietary supplementation, and the promotion of general well-being.

Instead our politicians, bureaucrats, and media insisted on business lockdowns, school closures, distancing, isolation, masks, and the mirage of a fast, effective vaccine.

As with almost everything in life, state intervention made the situation worse. We can only hope many governors are removed from office, either by impeachment or at the next election.

Several, including Andrew Cuomo in New York and Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, should face criminal charges for their lawless edicts. There is no due process exception for “public health.”

Lockdowns were never justified, either in terms of the covid-19 risk or the staggering economic tradeoffs, which will be felt for decades.

They certainly are not justified now, given seven months of additional data showing that the transmission and lethality of covid-19 are not particularly worse than previous SARS, swine flu, or Ebola pandemics.

We still don’t know how many of the reported two hundred thousand US covid-19 deaths were actually caused by the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory disease, or simply reflect people who died of other causes after exposure to covid-19.

We do know that the harms caused by the lockdowns far outweigh the harms posed by the covid-19 virus.

We have had nearly eight months of life and liberty stolen from us by politicians and their hysteria-promoting accomplices in media. How much more will we accept?

Ultimate Proof: Covid-19 Was Planned To Usher In The New World Order

A Positive Test Does Not Make You a Covid-19 Case,"I cannot help thinking that the “second wave” of this virus is a bit like the Victorian legend of “Spring Heeled Jack”: a useful fiction intended to keep the children quiet.

by Sean Walsh

In both cases there are sightings which do not, by themselves, add up to any existential certainty.

Jack has, of course, inherited this policing role from the dreaded “R” number, which even the most thick-headed members of the commentariat are beginning to suss is of no use when infection rates are low.

So, the PM has pivoted. With its now-familiar casual dishonesty the Government is alerting us to “spikes” in “cases” in some parts of the country.

As with most deception, the deceit resides in the language. There are no spikes in cases, there are increases in positive tests (entirely consistent with increases in test activity – and in fact explained by them).

A case is not the same as a positive test unless you think it is of no significance whether someone has symptoms or not.

There is a qualitative and very consequential difference between testing positive for this virus and being a “case” of it. This is a distinction the Johnson-Whitty-Hancock axis of perpetual control seems to have decided to collapse.

From the start of this crisis the government hid behind very second-rate scientists to project an interpretation of correct response which was purely numbers-based.

Mathematics is the Queen of the Sciences: it does not follow that important qualitative distinctions are never invisible to Her.

Instead of informing us of epidemiological risk, the PM decided in March to deprive us of the right to assess our lives for ourselves. This amounted to more than a confiscation of our civil liberties.

It was also an assault upon our personal systems of value. Some of us do not believe that death is the worst thing that can happen to us.

Some of us do not believe that illness is to be avoided at all cost. Some of us prefer to live our lives within a framework of belief in the transcendent.

Johnson’s interventions in March were a form of secular aggression against that preference.

And this has been the problem. I do not want my PM to be religious. But I want a Conservative PM to at the least have a religious sensibility. I want those who presume to govern me to have humility.

I want them to know that however powerful they seem to be in the moment that history is laughing at them from the perspective of the longer term.

I would prefer them to understand that you do not defeat a virus by looking into a TV camera and announcing that we all must stay at home.

This Government has no such sensibility and its response to Covid-19 has amounted to little more than a numbers game. And because they have promoted quantification over value they are in a fix.

There are real considerations of value which by their nature escape the variables of the grubby calculus of mortality which dominated the narrative in March.

There is no possibility, logically, of a second national lockdown because if one is imposed there will be no “nation” left to emerge from it.

The bonds that tie a nation together are difficult to understand and therefore easy to accidentally destroy.

The public has been infantilised to the extent that it has become normal to see parents put masks on their children.

A very logical consequence of the assumption that a Government has the right to make it difficult for us to smile at each other in public places.

This is last chance stuff. The spiritual crisis is that pronounced.

The proper attitude to the possibility of a “second wave” is one of acceptance – a primary Christian sensibility which all conservatives should be happy to cultivate.

I would imagine – hope – that every parent who told their child the tale of Spring Heeled Jack knew deep down that the inculcation of fear is very dubious, morally.

I am not sure this dysfunctional, patrician and unconservative Government has that level of compassion. Or understanding. Or even that it cares very much.",8/16/20 0:00,,0
Ex-Russian Intel Officer Says COVID-19 is Part of the Depopulation Agenda,"The Coronavirus Depopulation Agenda is exposed in this revealing interview with an ex-Russian military intelligence officer.

I have taken the time to transcribe it in full below, using the translation provided by YouTube translator Inessa S, whose work I trust and value (and have been following for years).

In this climate of Big Tech censorship, with coronavirus videos being taken down rapidly, there is no way of knowing how long it be allowed by the NWO (New World Order) censors to remain up.

In exposing the coronavirus depopulation agenda, the video connects the dots and gives a deeper perspective of Operation Coronavirus. The interview shows this was recorded on March 25th, 2020.

Testimony of Russian ex-Military Intelligence Officer on Coronavirus Depopulation Agenda

Interviewer (I): Today we have Vladimir Kvachkov as our guest, a Colonel of the GRU (Military Intelligence Officer), a public figure, with a PhD in military science.

Vladimir Vasilievich Kvachkov (V): Good afternoon.

I: Yes, good afternoon, Vladimir Vasilievich. I know you served, among other things, as the leading researcher for the Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Considering your expertise, what do you make of the coronavirus phenomenon?

V: It’s exactly this perspective that you need to examine it from. Not from the public health perspective, nor epidemiology, etc. The coronavirus phenomenon that they falsely deem a pandemic needs to be examine from the perspective of global powers.

Religious, political, financial, economic and national. The coronavirus phenomenon, the so-called pandemic – and let me tell you, there’s no pandemic, it’s all a lie – needs to be considered as a global, strategic special operation. This is exactly how you need to think of this thing. These are command and staff exercises of the world’s behind-the-scenes powers on controlling humanity. This is what the goal of this coronavirus is.

I’ll repeat it once again. We have little faith in God and even less so in the existence of Satan, the enemy of the human race. So, the aim of the behind-the-scenes Zionist and financial powers is reducing the world’s population. It’s their idée fixe.

They think there’s too many of us ordinary people in the world. There should be around 100 million of their kind and a maximum of 1 billion people on Earth to serve them. Then they’ll be living in abundance here on Earth.

Because, us the people, the earthlings – there’s too many of us for the behind-the-scenes world powers.

This is why the coronavirus and the financial crisis that has emerged almost immediately – they’re inextricably tied to one another. The aim is to stop people’s movement around the world, to curtail political freedoms.

In political terms, it would be practically impossible to do all that. There are differences in constitutions. Whether they’re being implemented or not – that is a different question.

However, there are some political rights that people are accustomed to and they believe they theirs to have forever.

The first attempt to take away those rights from people happened on September 11th, 2001. Not many seem to remember that, after the so-called attack on WTC towers, Pentagon and White House in the USA, the global war on terrorism was declared.

Let’s remember, in order to understand what the coronavirus is now, let’s analyze that first attempt – the declaration of war on humanity that was disguised as a war on terrorism. That was 19 years ago. The behind-the-scenes world powers created the events of September 11, 2001.

Now they need another excuse for greater control and takeover of humanity. That’s how they came up with the coronavirus. Basically, to put it this way, that’s not a pandemic, not an epidemic.

Even now, I literally looked at the data this morning, 300 people in the world die from it daily. You can imagine what kind of scale this is.

Of course, I’m sorry about each person who dies, but 300 people across 7.5 billion people – that’s basically nothing.

These command-and-staff exercises of the behind-the-scenes world powers have an aim to limit different political rights and make people afraid. The fools are already grabbing food in shops here. Millet, buckwheat, etc.

I: Toilet paper?

V: Yeah, even toilet paper? God! Why? The goal is to scare people. Once again, these are command-and-staff exercises of the behind-the-scenes Zionist and financial liberal world powers with the aim of limiting the political rights that people are basically accustomed to having, especially in Western Europe. That’s their second goal.

The first goal is to reduce the population numbers on Earth. That’s their Satanic goal.

The second, political goal of the behind-the-scenes world powers is to seize power.

The third goal is related to finances and power over the economy.

Financial, as we already know, at least those who are interested in this … Now, for every product that exists – please, give me your pencil. Okay. Lets say this pencil costs 1 ruble or 1 dollar – let’s say it’s 1 dollar.

For this pencil, it was issued 20 times the amount – in money, in promissory notes, equities and other financial derivatives. That means, if you take the real value of this pencil, it comes with 20 different papers that carry 20 times the value.

Accordingly, all the financial and economic relations have gone from the real economy to this virtual economy. It’s a financial bubble that exists now and which encompasses, I think, 1 quadrillion and 200 trillion dollars. It’s a complete financial bubble. It needs to be deflated.

FRS, the Federal Reserve System, literally some days ago, that was in February, I think – they introduced a zero percent interest on deposits.

Now, in many countries, it’s even a negative interest rate – that is, you deposited 100 dollars and you get 90 or 95 dollars. But at least you’re still going to get it. So, we’re already getting negative interest rates on deposits. So, that wealth has to be deflated. How will it be deflated?

Again, through this artificial international … we see the economy has crashed, it’s clear, accordingly – we can’t meet your domestic demand like we did before, you need to tighten your belts etc.

Now is a very important moment. Note, it allegedly started in China. Even though the Chinese are now adamant and report that the coronavirus was created artificially. It has an artificial origin – it’s been proven scientifically already.

Of course, in every virus, seeing that it’s the simplest kind of microorganism – as far as I remember – mutations can happen, but they’re of an accidental nature.

And when you take the RNA molecule, not DNA – they have RNA – and there’s a part of the genome that’s clearly been carved out and another one inserted in its place – and this happens 3 or 4 times …

It is perfectly obvious that the Chinese scientists have figured this out – it was artificially created and purposely spread, initially in Wuhan.

They had 2 kinds, 2 viral strains. Okay now. And what about Italy, what happened there? How come a strain that is even more dangerous that the Chinese one suddenly appears in Italy? I think now they have a few thousand infected and around 1000 have already died.

But again, 100x more people die in Italy from flu, pneumonia, scrofula and hepatitis. But we don’t talk about that. Instead, we are being served special political information propaganda, psycho-informative propaganda.

Special psycho-informative operation of the world globalist mass media that is serving the behind-the-scene Zionist liberal powers that are creating this terror right now. This is why we need to deal with this phenomenon as we would with a special operation that is conducted in the form of command and staff exercises. Now they’re looking – who’s obeying and who’s not.

In China, they introduced strict measures. But, then comrade Xi went to Wuhan and put the pro-American party faction who took that road in their place. In China, not everything is smooth there.

They have, let’s call them that – a pro-Chinese (patriotic) faction, that’s somewhat close to us, which is associated with Xi Jinping. And there are obviously pro-American ex-Komsomol members that are money-oriented or simply put – have their focus on the ‘dough’ (money). And they, of course, tried to use the coronavirus in Wuhan to gain certain economic and political benefits.

Comrade Xi put them all in their place and, consequently, in was over with the virus in China. And then it started in Europe. Accordingly, we as a military intelligence, look at “who” (it is obvious) and “where” (it is also obvious).

Europe and China are 2 geo-economic adversaries of the USA. And this is where they injected this virus.

This virus also has a 4th dimension as well – the economic one. The first is the religious one – destruction of people on Earth, reducing the population numbers. The second one is to establish political control over humanity.

The third one is the financial deflation of that gigantic financial bubble. And the fourth dimension is the elimination of their geo-economic competition.

This I’m telling you from the perspective of an officer from the Defence and Strategic Studies of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. This is my assessment of the current epidemic.

I: Vladimir Vasilievich, you spoke with clarity, you laid it out military style. Can you give us any military predictions for the nearest future?

V: In connection to the coronavirus?

I: Yes. What do you think, which countries could expect pressure next?

V: Russia, of course. It’s going to be Russia, surely. Because … for America, Russia isn’t an economic competitor.

Now, the main efforts of the behind-the-scenes world powers are focused on causing disruption in China and Western Europe. And Russia is their target on 2 accounts: they want to reduce our population numbers and cleanse our territory. That is still to come. Yes.

I: Of course, we would like to hear your opinion regarding a practical plan of action, how to act, how to protect oneself, some recommendations. Maybe it’s not your field of expertise (of what to do), but maybe you could tell us something.

V: I’m, of course, no epidemiologist. Although, you could say I’m a parasitologist, because you have to be one in order to understand the power structures in Russia.

So, I’m speaking as a military doctor – epidemiologist and parasitologist. Until we’re able to get rid of our internal parasites who rule over us, we won’t be able to tackle other parasites.

Key Points of his Account

This ex-intelligence officer’s perspective is very interesting for a number of reasons. He names 4 agendas at play here: the coronavirus depopulation agenda, the restriction of freedom and rights, the financial agenda (deflating the bubble, crashing the economy) and the geopolitical and geo-economic agenda.

He names the Zionists as part of the shadowy group that is running the world and behind Operation Coronavirus. He refers to it as an exercise, in alignment with Mike Pompeo’s admission of this as a live exercise.

He recognizes from the few people dying that this is no way a genuine pandemic. He sees that this as a continuation of what started in 2001 with the 9/11 false flag op (as I discussed in The New War on Bioterror) – the next phase in their NWO quest to create a global government.

He believes in the evidence pointing to the coronavirus as a deliberately created bioweapon, used to hurt China and Europe.

This last point is the only one I don’t fully agree with, since it assumes there is a “virus” spreading around the world and we can also see that the economic impact upon the US (not just China and Europe) has been massive (especially since mid-March).

Nonetheless, this is a worthwhile account from someone who has seen through the lies.

Latest CDC Data: Covid-19 Poses Virtually No Death Risk for People Under the Age of 50,"New CDC data confirm that the Wuhan coronavirus poses almost zero death risk in people below the age of 50 (see details below).

by Mike Adams

At the same time, these data also confirm the virus remains extremely dangerous to people over the age of 70, and the CDC estimates that 1 in 18 elderly people who contract the virus (i.e. are “infected”) end up being killed by it.

Meanwhile, the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for people 50 – 69 years is 1 in 200, making it far deadlier than the seasonal flu for individuals in that group.

But for people aged 20 – 49 years, the IFR drops to just 1 in 5000. This means that for every 5,000 people who are infected within this age group, one fatality is expected.

Those below the age of 20 have an even lower fatality rate: About 1 in 33,000.

In summary, the risk of death from the coronavirus in people under the age of 50 is extremely small, and approaching zero.

These numbers are based on the CDC’s new data released at the following link, using “Scenario 5” which is labeled, “Current Best Estimate”: CDC.gov

CDC data confirm the danger to elderly people while simultaneously showing how little risk there is to younger Americans

What’s especially notable in these CDC data is how they simultaneously confirm three very important things:

1) Yes, the coronavirus was killing a very high percentage of infected people as it was sweeping through nursing homes where mostly elderly people were present.

During its peak in early-to-mid April of this year, we calculated the virus was killing 1 in 10 people who showed symptoms.

This is very similar to the CDC’s current data for the 70+ age group, where the virus is currently killing 1 in 18 people who are infected, while 40% of infections are asymptomatic.

This means 10.8 people out of the 18 are symptomatic, which is nearly identical to our calculated number of 1 in 10.

Notably, the early deaths in America were happening almost exclusively among the elderly, which is one reason why the death rate was initially so high.

2) Now that we have more detailed demographic data, we know that the Wuhan coronavirus is nearly harmless to college-aged young adults, which means that running strict covid-19 lockdowns and social distancing mandates on college campuses is non-scientific and a complete waste of time and energy.

All college lockdowns should be immediately ended.

3) We also know that among typical working-aged Americans in the 20 – 49 group, there is such a low risk of death that locking down workplaces and sending everyone home is another useless endeavor.

It means the corporate lockdowns are rooted in junk science, not real risks.

Based on these data, it’s also safe for most people to vote in person

These data show that it’s also perfectly safe for most people to vote in person. Only those who are 60+ would likely face any significant risk of death from contracting a covid-19 infection.

Yet the Democrats claim the existence of coronavirus “cases” (i.e. infections) demands that everybody vote by mail, opening up all sorts of opportunities for Democrats to cheat and rig elections nationwide through ballot stuffing, selective ballot destruction, ballot harvesting and other nefarious methods.

Most importantly, these data show that coronavirus “cases” are meaningless if detected in someone who isn’t sick.

The left-wing media continues to try to terrorize the nation by claiming tens of thousands of new “cases” each day, but these cases are almost universally non-significant in that the patients demonstrate no symptoms and no sickness.

Furthermore, the tests being used to diagnose such “cases” are extremely unreliable and likely rooted in predominantly false positives.

In fact, in a truly shocking development that has not been reported by the fake news media, the former Chief Science Officer of Pfizer is now claiming the entire “second wave” of the pandemic is being faked through the use of unreliable mass testing that’s producing mostly false positives.

You can watch him say these things in this extraordinary interview:

﻿ ﻿

The bottom line? Unless you’re over the age of 60 or so, the coronavirus poses very little risk to you. The lockdown reactions toward the virus are wildly exaggerated and medically unnecessary.

While precautions should be taken for those who are elderly and therefore more vulnerable to risks of death, younger Americans don’t need vaccines, masks, social distancing or lockdowns.

What they need is to get their lives back.

Open the schools, the cities, the churches, the restaurants and the movie theaters. End the mask mandates and recommend vitamin D, zinc, quercetin and licorice root herbs.

Legalize hydroxychloroquine nationwide and we can end this entire pandemic for the vast majority of the population.",9/28/20 0:00,,0
Russian COVID Chief: ‘It’s Just the Flu With Minimal Mortality. Why Has the Whole World Been Destroyed? That I Don’t Know.’,"Alexander Myasnikov was appointed in April to his new role of informing Russians about coronavirus treatment and prevention methods and to battle “fake news” about Covid-19.

This man is the equivalent of Dr. Anthony Fauci in the US, or perhaps Dr. Deborah Birx.

It is difficult to overstate how important his claims are:

“It’s all bullsh*t. It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease (i.e. the flu) with minimal mortality. Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know.”

The 1.5 hour long interview below is only in Russian, but if you can understand it, it is well worth watching, because a lot of important information is covered.

The interviewer is Ksenia Sobchak, who is very liberal – think of her as like a Russian Rachel Maddow. Like liberals in the West, she very much wants to believe the COVID situation is much worse than it really is.

Myasnikov explains to her in detail why it is in fact very difficult to assign ’cause of death’ in most cases, because there are usually several, in addition to a lot of other things.

It is a great interview, in which the good doctor finally loses his patience and tells her its not nearly as dangerous as people think, and that the whole world has over-reacted.

He also insists that the death numbers in the West are way over-counted.

He’s right: Dr. Kendrick: I’ve Signed Death Certificates During Covid-19. Here’s Why You Can’t Trust Any Of The Statistics On The Number Of Victims

This interview is also a great example of the high level of journalism in Russia – this is much more genuine, open, exciting, and authentic than most of what is on mainstream media in the West.

The CDC Confirms Remarkably Low Coronavirus Death Rate: 0.26%

Just watch a few seconds of the intro, and you will get the idea:

From the Moscow Times:

Russia’s head of coronavirus information has suggested that global anxiety over the pandemic is misplaced, his latest controversial comment after saying that the infection would kill as many people as it needs to.

Doctor and television presenter Alexander Myasnikov was appointed in April to his new role of informing Russians about coronavirus treatment and prevention methods and to battle “fake news” about Covid-19. After calling the country’s reported low death rate a “Russian miracle,” Myasnikov said last week that “those meant to die will die” from it.

In an interview that aired Wednesday, Myasnikov gestured for the cameras to stop running and said candidly:

“It’s all bullsh*t. It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality,” he told television personality Ksenia Sobchak in the interview for her YouTube project.

“Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,” Myasnikov said.

Edward Snowden Says Governments Are Using COVID-19 To ‘Monitor Us Like Never Before’,"What Snowden Has To Say About The Coronavirus

According to Edward Snowden,

“Governments around the world are are exploiting the pandemic to monitor us like never before.” He and many others have been pointing out how society is moving fast towards an authoritarian type of existence, and how it’s already here.

The enforcement or advocacy of strict obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom has been here for quite a while, and it’s done in a very clever way.

Many of us are concerned about having a good job, a house, a family and many of us believe we have freedom without being aware that in many ways, we really don’t.

And all of the measures that take away our freedom are done so by manufacturing our consent to these measures, or by governments simply implementing these measures without the knowledge or approval of the people.

As Snowden mentions in his interview below, fear, panic and hysteria are usually the tools used to implement and justify these measures and manufacture our consent.

As authoritarianism spreads, as emergency laws proliferate, as we sacrifice our rights, we also sacrifice our capability to arrest the slide into a less liberal and less free world. Do you truly believe that when the first wave, this second wave, the 16th wave of the coronavirus is a long forgotten memory, that these capabilities will not be kept? – Edward Snowden (source)

Snowden points out that just like 9/11, the coronavirus will be used to heighten even more surveillance and security measures that won’t go away.

I am sure many measures that are being put in place, just as they were put into place after 9/11, will remain classified and completely hidden from the citizenry. That’s why people like Edward Snowden are so important.

We are also seeing an authoritarian type of dictator policing the internet as well. Dr. Ron Paul had a piece that was recently flagged as ‘false news’ for simply sharing his opinion. He shares the same thoughts as Snowden to an extent:

Governments love crises because when the people are fearful they are more willing to give up freedoms for promises that the government will take care of them. After 9/11, for example, Americans accepted the near-total destruction of their civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act’s hollow promises of security.

People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus “pandemic” could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit – financially or politically – from the ensuing panic.

That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure.

But we have seen this movie before. Government over-hypes a threat as an excuse to grab more of our freedoms. When the “threat” is over, however, they never give us our freedoms back. – Paul (source)

Below is a very interesting interview that Snowden recently gave with Glenn Greenwald, where they explore the “under-discussed consequences of the coronavirus pandemic” and “the risk of acquiescing to more surveillance during times of peril.” In it he goes into greater detail.

“Martial Law” Being Seen In U.S. and Europe Over COVID-19 Is The Bigger Threat,"NYC’s governor Andrew Cuomo wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times begging President U.S. Donald Trump to enact martial law.

Meanwhile, other states have already taken shocking martial law measures without an official declaration, showing our potential unconstitutional future under fears of the coronavirus that likely won’t go away after the pandemic has subsided.

All over the U.S. there seems be this new trend — military and police now acting as if we are under martial law without a formal declaration of such.

Yet, here we have NYC’s governor Cuomo begging Trump to essentially declare martial law by utilizing the military for the COVID-19 pandemic and federalize shutdowns.

“Slowing the spread of coronavirus is a function of testing and reducing the density of public gatherings.

“So first, Mr. President, you must stop the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from overregulating the testing process, and authorize states to certify a wider array of testing labs and methods,” Cuomo writes.

Cuomo goes on to express that Trump should utilize the Army Corps of Engineers to transform existing facilities into temporary medical centers.

States cannot build more hospitals, acquire ventilators or modify facilities quickly enough.

At this point, our best hope is to utilize the Army Corps of Engineers to leverage its expertise, equipment and people power to retrofit and equip existing facilities — like military bases or college dormitories — to serve as temporary medical centers.

Then we can designate existing hospital beds for the acutely ill.

To sum up what Trump can do to defend against the spread of the coronavirus Cuomo writes,

“In short: Localize testing, federalize shutdowns and task the Army Corps of Engineers to expand hospital capacity.”

While building hospital beds in existing facilities and using the military to do so isn’t a bad idea, forced quarantines would be expanding the police state.

NYC hasn’t yet gone into “martial law mode,” but other states have basically enacted it in the form of the National Guard being deployed in heavily infected areas.

According to reports, the National Guard has been deployed so far to six states with many more expected to follow.

Beyond that, there are reports that Kentucky has a patient who refused to self isolate.

As a result, the state took things into their own hands by suspending his rights and police are now guarding him armed 24/7 at his house.

If that’s not enough, there was a video posted online of New Orleans’ police in several cop cars demanding citizens leave the streets and disperse immediately.

Then there is the curfew in New Jersey for residents and forced closure of restaurants and certain stores in other states like — California, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington, with more following suit.

“Effective tonight, all other non-essential retail, recreational, and entertainment businesses MUST CLOSE after 8:00 PM,” said Murphy.

“All non-essential and non-emergency travel in New Jersey is strongly discouraged between the hours of 8:00 PM and 5:00 AM This will remain in effect for the foreseeable future. We want everyone to be home –- and not out,” he added.

What’s more is the U.S. isn’t the only one.

The UK and Italy have declared a nationwide lockdown; in other words, imposing martial law on its citizens, as well as France which followed suit, deploying 100,000 police to enforce a national quarantine in the country.

As this pandemic continues to spread we can expect more quarantines and police state actions across the world in other countries.

Back in the U.S. gun sales are skyrocketing in several states as fear of uncertainty from the virus and stock market collapse takes over American citizens seeking protection in the form of arming themselves, as LA Times reported.

Yes, everywhere you look the police state is increasing all in the name of the coronavirus, arguably one of the world’s most infectious diseases in history.

Still, these measures being put into place now will likely remain long after the pandemic has stopped and the virus has run its course. That’s the everlasting effect that COVID-19 will have on our society.

The coronavirus is now classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and it may very well be a legitimate health concern for all of us around the world. But it’s the government’s response that should worry us all more in the long run.

Epidemiologist Knut Wittkowski: Covid-19 is Not Dangerous 'Unless You Have Age-related Severe Comorbidities',"Epidemiologist Knut Wittkowski: Covid-19 is Not Dangerous ‘Unless You Have Age-related Severe Comorbidities’

Knut Wittkowski is one such expert who has long argued for a change of course. For 20 years, Wittkowski was the head of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at The Rockefeller University’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science. spiked spoke to him to find out more about the pandemic.

Governments around the world say they are following ‘The Science’ with their draconian measures to stem the spread of the virus. But the science around Covid-19 is bitterly contested. Many experts have serious doubts about the effectiveness of the measures, and argue that our outsized fears of Covid-19 are not justified.

Knut Wittkowski: No, unless you have age-related severe comorbidities. So if you are in a nursing home because you cannot live by yourself anymore, then getting infected is dangerous.

We had the other extreme in Switzerland, which was hit pretty hard. There was one child that died. People believed that this child was born in 2011. In fact, it was born in 1911, and that was the only child that died. It was a mere coding error. Somebody with the age 108 was coded as aged eight.

Wittkowski: It is over in China. It is over in South Korea. It is substantially down in most of Europe and down a bit everywhere, even in the UK. The UK and Belarus are latecomers, so you do not see exactly what you are seeing in continental Europe. But everywhere in Europe, the number of cases is substantially declining.

Now, as we know, children and young adults do not end up in hospitals. It is only those who are both elderly and have comorbidities that do. Therefore you have to protect the elderly and the nursing homes.

I hope the intervention did not have too much of an impact because it most likely made the situation worse. The intervention was to ‘flatten the curve’. That means that there would be the same number of cases but spread out over a longer period of time, because otherwise the hospitals would not have enough capacity.

Wittkowski: When the whole thing started, there was one reason given for the lockdown and that was to prevent hospitals from becoming overloaded. There is no indication that hospitals could ever have become overloaded, irrespective of what we did. So we could open up again, and forget the whole thing.

How long can you do that for? For three weeks, that is possible. For 18 months, it is not. The flattening of the curve, the prolongation of the epidemic, makes it more difficult to protect the elderly, who are at risk. More of the elderly people become infected, and we have more deaths.

The ideal approach would be to simply shut the door of the nursing homes and keep the personnel and the elderly locked in for a certain amount of time, and pay the staff overtime to stay there for 24 hours per day.

Wittkowski: Firstly, we have the direct consequences: suicides, domestic violence and other social consequences leading to death. And then we have people who are too scared to go to the hospitals for other problems like strokes or heart attacks. So people stay away from hospitals because of the Covid fear. And then they die.

Wittkowski: Germany had 8,000 deaths in a population of 85million. They had 20,000 to 30,000 hospitalisations. In Germany, that is nothing. It does not even show up as a blip in the hospital statistics. In Britain, the highest hospital utilisation was about 60 per cent, if I am not mistaken.

New York is the epicenter of the epidemic in the United States, and even here at the epicenter, hospital utilisation was only up a bit. Nothing dramatic. Nothing out of the ordinary. That is what happens during the flu season. People have the flu, and then there are more patients in the hospitals than there otherwise would be.

In New York City, it was a bit higher. The Javits Congress Center was turned into a field hospital with 3,000 beds. It treated just 1,000 patients in all. The Navy ship sent to New York by President Trump had 179 patients but it was sent back because it was not needed.

We will actually get a bit higher than that. So we have flattened what otherwise would have been a peak, and if we now let it run, even if the number of cases would increase a bit, it would not get as high as it was, because we already have enough immune people in the population. So it is not going to spread as fast as it could have spread in the beginning.

Wittkowski: All the studies that have been done have shown that we already have at least 25 per cent of the population who are immune. That gives us a nice cushion. If 25 per cent of the population are already immune, we are very quickly getting to the 50 per cent that we need to have what is called herd immunity.

Wittkowski: This is an invention to justify a policy that politicians are afraid of reversing.

spiked: Should people practice social distancing?

Wittkowski: No.

spiked: Why not?

Wittkowski: Why? What is the justification for that? People need to ask the government for an explanation. The government is restricting freedom. You do not have to ask me for justification. There is no justification. It is the government that has to justify what it is doing. Sorry, but that is how it is.

spiked: How did we get this so wrong?

Wittkowski: Governments did not have an open discussion, including economists, biologists and epidemiologists, to hear different voices. In Britain, it was the voice of one person – Neil Ferguson – who has a history of coming up with projections that are a bit odd.

The government did not convene a meeting with people who have different ideas, different projections, to discuss his projection. If it had done that, it could have seen where the fundamental flaw was in the so-called models used by Neil Ferguson. His paper was published eventually, in medRxiv. The assumption was that one per cent of all people who became infected would die. There is no justification anywhere for that.

Let us say the epidemic runs with a basic reproduction rate of around two. Eventually 80 per cent of the population will be immune, because they have been infected at some point in time. Eighty per cent of the British population would be something like 50million. One per cent of them dying is 500,000. That is where Ferguson’s number came from.

But we knew from the very beginning that neither in Wuhan nor in South Korea did one per cent of all people infected die. South Korea has 60million people. It is about the same size as the UK. How many deaths were in South Korea? Did they shut down? No. The South Korean government was extremely proud to have resisted pressure to drop the very basic concepts of democracy.

The epidemic in South Korea was over by March, the number of cases was down by 13 March. In Wuhan they also did not shut down the economy. Wuhan had restricted travel out of the city.

They stopped train services and blocked the roads. They did not restrict anything social within the city until very late. We have seen, then, in Wuhan and South Korea, if you do not do anything, the epidemic is over in three weeks.

Knowing that the epidemic would be over in three weeks, and the number of people dying would be minor, just like a normal flu, the governments started shutting down in mid-March.

Why? Because somebody pulled it out of his head that one per cent of all infected would die. One could argue that maybe one per cent of all cases would die. But one per cent of all people infected does not make any sense. And we had that evidence by mid-March.

spiked: Just to clarify, cases are different from people infected?

Wittkowski: Cases means people who have symptoms that are serious enough for them to go to a hospital or get treated. Most people have no symptoms at all. But waking up with a sore throat one day is not a case. A case means that someone showed up in a hospital.

spiked: The UK government was also heavily influenced by the situation in Italy. Why did that go so wrong?

Wittkowski: What we saw in Italy was that the virus was hitting those who were both old and had comorbidities, so lots of people died. But the median age of those who died in Italy was around 81 years. It is not that children or working people were dying.

It was the elderly in nursing homes – not even the elderly living by themselves mostly. We saw lots of deaths and that scared people. But then, Italy did an illogical thing. It closed schools so that the schoolchildren were isolated and did not get infected and did not become immune.

Instead, the virus spread almost exclusively among the old, causing more deaths and a higher utilisation of hospitals. And that is mind-boggling.

Very early on, we knew from China and we knew from South Korea that this is an epidemic that runs its course, and there was nothing special about it. But when it hit Italy, we stopped thinking about it as an age-stratified problem, and instead lumped everyone all together.

The idea that if we did not shut down the schools the hospitals would have been overwhelmed does not make any sense. I frankly still cannot fully understand how our governments can be so stupid.

spiked: Governments say they are following the science. Is that really true?

Wittkowski: They have the scientists on their side that depend on government funding. One scientist in Germany just got $500million from the government, because he always says what the government wants to hear.

Scientists are in a very strange situation. They now depend on government funding, which is a trend that has developed over the past 40 years. Before that, when you were a professor at a university, you had your salary and you had your freedom.

Now, the university gives you a desk and access to the library. And then you have to ask for government money and write grant applications. If you are known to criticise the government, what does that do to your chance of getting funded? It creates a huge conflict of interest. The people who are speaking out in Germany and Switzerland are all independent of government money because they are retired.

spiked: Did the Swedish scientists get it right?

Wittkowski: Sweden did the right thing. And they had to take a lot of heat for it. Now compare Sweden and the UK. The only difference is that Sweden did fine. They did have a problem. They had a relatively high number of deaths among the nursing homes.

They decided to keep society open and they forgot to close nursing homes. Remarkably, the politicians acknowledged that it was a mistake to extend that open concept to nursing homes. The nursing homes should have been isolated to protect the elderly who are at high risk. But I think the Swedish government is doing well to even acknowledge that mistake.

The first death in the United States was in a nursing home in Seattle. And that was by the end of February. So everybody knew that we were expecting the same thing that we had seen in Italy – an epidemic that hits the elderly.

But until just this week in New York State, the government told the nursing homes that if they did not take in patients from hospitals, they would lose their funding. So they would have to import the virus from the hospitals.

One third of all deaths in New York State were in nursing homes. One could have prevented 20,000 deaths in the United States by just isolating the nursing homes. After three or four weeks, they could have reopened and everybody would be happy.

That would have been a reasonable strategy. But shutting down schools, driving the economy against the wall – there was no reason for it. The only reason that this nonsense now goes on and on, and people are inventing things like this ‘second wave’, which is going to force us to change society and never live again, is that the politicians are afraid of admitting an error.

spiked: Is this easier to see in hindsight?

Wittkowski: What I am talking about is not hindsight. The epidemics in Wuhan and South Korea were over in mid-March. In March, I submitted a paper to medRxiv, summarising all of that. At least towards the end of March, the data was there, and everybody who wanted to learn from it could.

On 17 April, Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, presented data at the coronavirus presidential briefing at the White House. And there was one plot that he presented. And I looked at it and asked why people were not jumping to their feet.

Why were people not understanding what they were looking at? The plot was the data from the ILINet. For 15 years, hospitals have counted every person who shows up with an influenza-like illness – fever, coughing, whatever. There were three spikes in the 2019-2020 flu season.

The first was in late December – influenza B. The next was in late January – an influenza A epidemic. And then there was one that had a peak in hospital visits around 8 March – Covid-19.

For the peak to happen on that day, those patients have to go through a seven-day incubation period and then have symptoms. But they do not go to the hospital with the first symptoms. If it gets worse over three days, only then do they go to a hospital.

Four weeks later, on 8 April, the number of new infections was already down. In time for Easter, our governments should have acknowledged they were overly cautious. People would have accepted that. Two weeks’ shutdown would not have been the end of the world.

We would not have what we have now – 30million people unemployed in the United States, for example. Companies do not go bankrupt over a two-week period. Two months is a very different story. If you have to pay rent for two months for a restaurant in New York with no income, you will go bankrupt.

We see unemployment, we see bankruptcies, we see a lot of money wasted for economic-rescue packages – trillions of dollars in the United States. We see more deaths and illness than we would otherwise have had.

And it is going on and on and on, just because governments are afraid of admitting an error. They are trying to find excuses. They say they have to do things slowly, and that they have ‘avoided 500,000 deaths’ in the UK. But that was an absurd number that had no justification.

The person presenting it pretended it was based on a model. It was not a model. It was the number of one per cent of all people infected dying. And nobody was questioning it. And that is the basic problem.

spiked: People will say that the interventions in South Korea – like contact tracing – were more effective.

Wittkowski: How many orders of magnitude, take us from 500,000 to 256, the number of deaths in South Korea? To have that kind of effect you would have to put everybody in the UK into a negative pressure room. It is totally unrealistic to even consider a reduction from 500,000 to 256.

"As Riots Continue, More Proof That COVID-19 Narrative Was Just MSM Fake News","by Brian Shilhavy

As riots continue across the U.S. today, more and more evidence is surfacing that the months of lock downs were based on a false narrative propagated by the corporate media, which is where the real fake news originates these days, as their Big Tech partners work hard to suppress the truth about Coronavirus from publications like Health Impact News and others in the alternative media.

The publication Off-Guardian ran a story yesterday (May 31, 2020) with three examples where the media got caught trying to hide the truth about Coronavirus:

On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.

Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:

“It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know.”

According to an e-mail leaked to Danish newspaper Politiken, the Danish Health Authority disagree with their government’s approach to the coronavirus. They cover it in two articles here and here (For those who don’t speak Danish, thelocal.dk have covered the story too).

There’s a lot of interesting information there, not least of which is the clear implication that politicians appear to be pressing the scientific advisors to overstate the danger (they did the same thing in the UK), along with the decision of some civil servants to withhold data from the public until after the lockdown had been extended.

But by far the most important quote is from a March 15th e-mail [our emphasis]:

The Danish Health Authority continues to consider that covid-19 cannot be described as a generally dangerous disease, as it does not have either a usually serious course or a high mortality rate,”

Earlier this month, on May 9th, a report was leaked to the German alternate media magazine Tichys Einblick titled “Analysis of the Crisis Management”.

The report was commissioned by the German department of the interior, but then its findings were ignored, prompting one of the authors to release it through non-official channels.

The fall out of that, including attacks on the authors and minimising of the report’s findings, is all very fascinating and we highly recommend this detailed report (or read the full report here in German).

We’re going to focus on just the reports conclusions, including [our emphasis]:

The dangerousness of Covid-19 was overestimated: probably at no point did the danger posed by the new virus go beyond the normal level.

The danger is obviously no greater than that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false alarm .

. During the Corona crisis the State has proved itself as one of the biggest producers of Fake News.

After being attacked in the press, and suspended from his job, the leaker and other authors of the report released a joint statement, calling on the government to respond to their findings.

Read the full article HERE.

On May 29, 2020, The Strategic Culture Foundation also covered the story of the leaked document in Germany, and the attempts by the media there to do “damage control.”

Germany’s federal government and mainstream media are engaged in damage control after a report that challenges the established Corona narrative leaked from the interior ministry.

Some of the report key passages are:

The dangerousness of Covid-19 was overestimated: probably at no point did the danger posed by the new virus go beyond the normal level.

The people who die from Corona are essentially those who would statistically die this year, because they have reached the end of their lives and their weakened bodies can no longer cope with any random everyday stress (including the approximately 150 viruses currently in circulation).

Worldwide, within a quarter of a year, there has been no more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, compared to 1.5 million deaths [25,100 in Germany] during the influenza wave 2017/18.

The danger is obviously no greater than that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false alarm.

A reproach could go along these lines: During the Corona crisis the State has proved itself as one of the biggest producers of Fake News.

So far, so bad. But it gets worse.

The report focuses on the “manifold and heavy consequences of the Corona measures” and warns that these are “grave”.

More people are dying because of state-imposed Corona-measures than they are being killed by the virus.

The reason is a scandal in the making:

A Corona-focused German healthcare system is postponing life-saving surgery and delaying or reducing treatment for non-Corona patients.

Read the full article HERE.

Of course, the same thing is happening here in the U.S. Could part of the reason people are taking to the streets and rioting these past few days be because many are waking up to the fact that they have not been told the truth about why so many of them had to lose their jobs and freedoms?

Stay tuned, as we prepare to report more on this issue.",6/2/20 0:00,,0
"From 9/11 to COVID-19, It’s Been a Perpetual State of Emergency","“The fundamental political question is why do people obey a government. The answer is that they tend to enslave themselves, to let themselves be governed by tyrants. Freedom from servitude comes not from violent action, but from the refusal to serve. Tyrants fall when the people withdraw their support.” — Étienne De La Boétie, The Politics Of Obedience

Don’t pity this year’s crop of graduates because this COVID-19 pandemic caused them to miss out on the antics of their senior year and the pomp and circumstance of graduation.

Pity them because they have spent their entire lives in a state of emergency.

They were born in the wake of the 9/11 attacks; raised without any expectation of privacy in a technologically-driven, mass surveillance state; educated in schools that teach conformity and compliance; saddled with a debt-ridden economy on the brink of implosion; made vulnerable by the blowback from a military empire constantly waging war against shadowy enemies; policed by government agents armed to the teeth ready and able to lock down the country at a moment’s notice; and forced to march in lockstep with a government that no longer exists to serve the people but which demands they be obedient slaves or suffer the consequences.

It’s a dismal start to life, isn’t it?

Unfortunately, we who should have known better failed to maintain our freedoms or provide our young people with the tools necessary to survive, let alone succeed, in the impersonal jungle that is modern America.

We brought them into homes fractured by divorce, distracted by mindless entertainment, and obsessed with the pursuit of materialism. We institutionalized them in daycares and afterschool programs, substituting time with teachers and childcare workers for parental involvement. We turned them into test-takers instead of thinkers and automatons instead of activists.

We allowed them to languish in schools which not only look like prisons but function like prisons, as well — where conformity is the rule and freedom is the exception.

We made them easy prey for our corporate overlords, while instilling in them the values of a celebrity-obsessed, technology-driven culture devoid of any true spirituality. And we taught them to believe that the pursuit of their own personal happiness trumped all other virtues, including any empathy whatsoever for their fellow human beings

No, we haven’t done this generation any favors.

Given the current political climate and nationwide lockdown, things could only get worse.

For those coming of age today (and for the rest of us who are muddling along through this dystopian nightmare), here are a few bits of advice that will hopefully help as we navigate the perils ahead.

Be an individual. For all of its claims to champion the individual, American culture advocates a stark conformity which, as John F. Kennedy warned, is “the jailer of freedom, and the enemy of growth.” Worry less about fitting in with the rest of the world and instead, as Henry David Thoreau urged, become “a Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within you, opening new channels, not of trade, but of thought.”

Learn your rights. We’re losing our freedoms for one simple reason: most of us don’t know anything about our freedoms.

At a minimum, anyone who has graduated from high school, let alone college, should know the Bill of Rights backwards and forwards.

However, the average young person, let alone citizen, has very little knowledge of their rights for the simple reason that the schools no longer teach them.

So grab a copy of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and study them at home. And when the time comes, stand up for your rights before it’s too late.

Speak truth to power. Don’t be naive about those in positions of authority. As James Madison, who wrote our Bill of Rights, observed, “All men having power ought to be distrusted.”

We must learn the lessons of history. People in power, more often than not, abuse that power. To maintain our freedoms, this will mean challenging government officials whenever they exceed the bounds of their office.

Resist all things that numb you. Don’t measure your worth by what you own or earn. Likewise, don’t become mindless consumers unaware of the world around you.

Resist all things that numb you, put you to sleep or help you “cope” with so-called reality. Those who establish the rules and laws that govern society’s actions desire compliant subjects.

However, as George Orwell warned, “Until they become conscious, they will never rebel, and until after they rebelled, they cannot become conscious.”

It is these conscious individuals who change the world for the better.

Don’t let technology turn you into zombies. Technology anesthetizes us to the all-too-real tragedies that surround us.

Techno-gadgets are merely distractions from what’s really going on in America and around the world.

As a result, we’ve begun mimicking the inhuman technology that surrounds us and have lost our humanity. We’ve become sleepwalkers.

If you’re going to make a difference in the world, you’re going to have to pull the earbuds out, turn off the cell phones and spend much less time viewing screens.

Help others. We all have a calling in life. And I believe it boils down to one thing: You are here on this planet to help other people.

In fact, none of us can exist very long without help from others.

If we’re going to see any positive change for freedom, then we must change our view of what it means to be human and regain a sense of what it means to love and help one another.

That will mean gaining the courage to stand up for the oppressed.

Refuse to remain silent in the face of evil. Throughout history, individuals or groups of individuals have risen up to challenge the injustices of their age.

Nazi Germany had its Dietrich Bonhoeffer. The gulags of the Soviet Union were challenged by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

America had its color-coded system of racial segregation and warmongering called out for what it was, blatant discrimination and profiteering, by Martin Luther King Jr.

And then there was Jesus Christ, an itinerant preacher and revolutionary activist, who not only died challenging the police state of his day — namely, the Roman Empire — but provided a blueprint for civil disobedience that would be followed by those, religious and otherwise, who came after him.

What we lack today and so desperately need are those with moral courage who will risk their freedoms and lives in order to speak out against evil in its many forms.

Cultivate spirituality, reject materialism and put people first. When the things that matter most have been subordinated to materialism, we have lost our moral compass.

We must change our values to reflect something more meaningful than technology, materialism and politics.

Standing at the pulpit of the Riverside Church in New York City in April 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. urged his listeners:

[W]e as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a “thing-oriented” society to a “person-oriented” society.

When machines and computers, profit motive and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.

Pitch in and do your part to make the world a better place. Don’t rely on someone else to do the heavy lifting for you.

Don’t wait around for someone else to fix what ails you, your community or nation. As Mahatma Gandhi urged: “Be the change you wish to see in the world.”

Stop waiting for political saviors to fix what is wrong with this country. Stop waiting for some political savior to swoop in and fix all that’s wrong with this country.

Stop allowing yourselves to be drawn into divisive party politics. Stop thinking of yourselves as members of a particular political party, as opposed to citizens of the United States.

Most of all, stop looking away from the injustices and cruelties and endless acts of tyranny that have become hallmarks of American police state.

Be vigilant and do your part to recalibrate the balance of power in favor of “we the people.”

Say no to war. Addressing the graduates at Binghampton Central High School in 1968, at a time when the country was waging war “on different fields, on different levels, and with different weapons,” Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling declared:

Too many wars are fought almost as if by rote.

Too many wars are fought out of sloganry, out of battle hymns, out of aged, musty appeals to patriotism that went out with knighthood and moats.

Love your country because it is eminently worthy of your affection.

Respect it because it deserves your respect. Be loyal to it because it cannot survive without your loyalty.

But do not accept the shedding of blood as a natural function or a prescribed way of history — even if history points this up by its repetition.

That men die for causes does not necessarily sanctify that cause. And that men are maimed and torn to pieces every fifteen and twenty years does not immortalize or deify the act of war… find another means that does not come with the killing of your fellow-man.

Finally, prepare yourselves for what lies ahead. The demons of our age — some of whom disguise themselves as politicians — delight in fomenting violence, sowing distrust and prejudice, and persuading the public to support tyranny disguised as patriotism.

Overcoming the evils of our age will require more than intellect and activism. It will require decency, morality, goodness, truth and toughness.

As Serling concluded in his remarks to the graduating class of 1968:

“Toughness is the singular quality most required of you… we have left you a world far more botched than the one that was left to us… Part of your challenge is to seek out truth, to come up with a point of view not dictated to you by anyone, be he a congressman, even a minister…

“Are you tough enough to take the divisiveness of this land of ours, the fact that everything is polarized, black and white, this or that, absolutely right or absolutely wrong. This is one of the challenges.

“Be prepared to seek out the middle ground … that wondrous and very difficult-to-find Valhalla where man can look to both sides and see the errant truths that exist on both sides.

“If you must swing left or you must swing right — respect the other side. Honor the motives that come from the other side.

“Argue, debate, rebut — but don’t close those wondrous minds of yours to opposition.

“In their eyes, you’re the opposition. And ultimately … ultimately — you end divisiveness by compromise. And so long as men walk and breathe — there must be compromise…

“Are you tough enough to face one of the uglier stains upon the fabric of our democracy — prejudice?

“It’s the basic root of most evil. It’s a part of the sickness of man. And it’s a part of man’s admission, his constant sick admission, that to exist he must find a scapegoat.

“To explain away his own deficiencies — he must try to find someone who he believes more deficient… Make your judgment of your fellow-man on what he says and what he believes and the way he acts.

“Be tough enough, please, to live with prejudice and give battle to it. It warps, it poisons, it distorts and it is self-destructive.

“It has fallout worse than a bomb … and worst of all it cheapens and demeans anyone who permits himself the luxury of hating.”

The only way we’ll ever achieve change in this country is for people to finally say “enough is enough” and fight for the things that truly matter.

It doesn’t matter how old you are or what your political ideology is: wake up, stand up, speak up, and make your citizenship count for something more than just voting.

Pandemic or not, don’t allow your freedoms to be curtailed and your voice to be muzzled.

It’s our civic duty to make the government hear us — and heed us — using every nonviolent means available to us: picket, protest, march, boycott, speak up, sound off and reclaim control over the narrative about what is really going on in this country.

Mind you, the government doesn’t want to hear us. It doesn’t even want us to speak.

In fact, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the government has done a diabolically good job of establishing roadblocks to prevent us from exercising our First Amendment right to speech and assembly and protest.

Still we must persist.

So get active, get outraged, and get going: there’s work to be done.

“We Will See More Deaths Because of Social Distancing” – Leading Scientist on COVID-19 Pandemic,"Dr. Knut M. Wittkowski is one of many academics raising cause for concern over the current “lockdown” measures that’ve been initiated by multiple governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unfortunately, the points that scientists like Wittkowski make continue to be ignored by mainstream media, which contributes to the information they share being largely unacknowledged.

Information does however tend to permeate through social media, but there is an ever growing presence of an authoritative technological ‘fact checker’ that is attempting to discredit viewpoints, regardless of how valid they are and how much evidence is available to back up that viewpoint.

We’re actually at a point where opinion’s shared on big and in some cases, ‘controversial’ topics are flagged and deemed as ‘false news’ by Facebook ‘fact-checkers.’ One of the most recent examples was the opinion shared by Dr. Ron Paul.

Freedom of speech is being hindered, there’s no doubt about that, even when the opinions come from the leading experts in the field. Will the opinion of research of Wittkowski be flagged as well? We will see.

Wittkowski received his PhD in computer science from the University of Stuttgart and his ScD (Habilitation) in Medical Biometry from University Tübingen, both in Germany.

He worked for 15 years with Klaus Dietz, a leading epidemiologist who coined the term “reproduction number”, on the Epidemiology of HIV.

After this Wittkowski headed the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at The Rockefeller University, New York for 20 years.

Dr. Wittkowski is currently the CEO of ASDERA LLC, a company discovering novel treatments for complex diseases from data of genome – wide association studies.

The quotes and discussion below are from a recent interview with him that’s been put on YouTube, you can watch the full interview below. The interview is where the quote in the title comes from.

And you can check out a recent paper he put out on the topic as well, titled The first three months of the COVID-19 epidemic:

Epidemiological evidence for two separate strains of SARS-CoV-2 viruses spreading and implications for prevention strategies, here.

I looked into the claim that people make that in China and South Korea the social distancing had successfully helped to control the epidemic. I looked at the date when people actually started social distancing.

In China, the epidemic peaked on February 1st to February 5th, in that period. But the schools were not closed until February the 20th. That was two weeks later, in South Korea we have a similar pattern.

In both these areas, social distancing started long after the decline, and therefore “had very little impact on the epidemic. That means they had already reached herd immunity, or were about to reach herd immunity.”

They were very close, but by installing the social distancing, “they prevented it from actually getting to the final point. And this is why we’re still seeing new cases in South Korea several weeks after the peak.”

You cannot stop the spread of a respiratory disease within a family, and you cannot stop it from spreading with neighbours, with people who are delivering, who are physicians, people are social and even in times of social distancing they have contacts and any of those contacts could spread the disease.

It will go slowly so it will not build up herd immunity but it will happen, and it will go on forever until we let it go…. Humankind has survived all sorts of respiratory diseases, nature has a way of making sure that we survive.

He explains how “nothing is fundamentally different from the flus that we have seen before, every couple of years there’s a flu that’s a bit worse than the other flus were, and it goes away in exactly the way the other flus went away, and this one behaves exactly the same way.

“The epidemic has ended in China, it was ended in South Korea, in Iran it’s declining it will be ending anytime soon. It could be a bit longer than typically because of the containment which flattened and prolonged the epidemic. And in the United States we’re doing the same thing, we’re prolonging the epidemic to flatten the curve but eventually it will end.”

These stories are circulating the world and contributing to chaos and to people being afraid of things they shouldn’t be afraid of…. I’m not paid by government, so I’m entitled to actually do science.

According to Wittkowski, “There is nothing to be scared about, this is a flu epidemic like every other flu, maybe a bit more severe, but nothing that is fundamentally different from the flus that we’ve seen in other years.”

Again, when it comes to lockdown and social distancing, he re-iterates by stating,

“Well, we will see maybe a total of fewer cases that is possible, however we will see more cases among the elderly because we have prevented the school children from creating herd immunity.

“And so in the end we will see more death, because it’s the school children that don’t die it’s the elderly that die so we will see more death because of this social distancing.”

He goes on to emphasize that we will have a second wave because of social distancing and lockdown.

If we had herd immunity now, there couldn’t be a second wave in autumn…If we had herd immunity, we wouldn’t have a second wave.

However, if we prevented herd immunity from developing, it is almost guaranteed that we have a second wave as soon as either we stop the social distancing or the climate changes with winter coming or something like that.

COVID Taught Us: We Have No Human Rights,"by Henry Makow PhD

The MSM is always talking about “human rights.” But only sexual and ethnic minorities have them, in order to sabotage and dispossess the majority.

Have you ever seen the MSM defend the “human rights” of Christians, heterosexuals, anti-vaxxers, or people of European descent?

Even COVID observes these laws. It infects Trump rallies but not BLM protests, truly a Communist virus.

I won’t sugarcoat this: Everyone who doesn’t serve the Illuminati will be dispossessed or worse.

Ultimately, “sustainable development” means substantially reducing the world’s population. An orchestrated nuclear war during Trump’s second term may accomplish this goal.

The COVID hoax has taught us that our government and MSM do not represent us. They represent the Illuminati – a satanic cult led by the world banking cartel – that regards humanity as redundant.

They want us to be less of a burden on the world’s natural resources. Their world is a paradise for them but a nightmare for everyone else. This is their Agenda 30.

The COVID hoax teaches us that we are essentially powerless. We have no human rights.

They can destroy our livelihoods, force us to wear useless face diapers, tell us where to stand, and restrict travel. They can impose restrictions if we want to buy food.

The object is to teach us that we are powerless and must obey. The object is to train us like animals.

Then they will introduce mandatory vaccinations that may poison us, reprogram our DNA, and identify if we are compliant or not.

We need to organize and demand our human rights. We need to flood our traitorous politicians with demands for:

1. Freedom of speech

2. Freedom of Information.

3. Freedom of assembly.

4. Freedom of belief & worship.

5. Freedom of movement.

6. Freedom from forced vaccination.

7. Freedom from restrictions due to opting out of vaccinations.

These are human rights. They are given to us by God, not by subverted and corrupt governments. They can’t take them away. But unless we fight for them, they will be gone permanently.

DEDICATE MANKIND TO SATAN

Mankind is the prize in an eternal battle with Satan.

God’s Plan is for human beings to know Him, become more God-like, and create Heaven on Earth.

Satan wishes to tear up God’s Plan, deny the Creator even exists, and whittle down the human race to Satanists and their servants.

God’s Plan is for humans to manifest their Divinity.

Satan’s Plan is for humans to be domestic animals.

We have lost our identity: God is our True Identity. But we can only know this by serving Him.

We are the prize.

Will we be like our Creator and flourish?

or like Demons and destroy ourselves?

We’ve reached the tipping point.

The focus on why the coronavirus is a hoax and the tests are bogus, misses the point. The point is that the Illuminati bankers are deliberately destroying civilized society. The “virus” is just a means to an end: A Communist satanist world police state, i.e. the NWO.",10/9/20 0:00,,0
German Doctors on COVID-19: ‘We Have A Lot of Evidence That It’s A Fake Story All Over The World’,"Is this article ‘fake news?’ No, because the statement in the title that reads “we have a lot of evidence that it’s a fake story all over the world” is an actual quote from a representative of the group discussed in the article.

The statement was said. Whether or not what the quote says is true, on the other hand, is up for you to decide or according to multiple governments, is up for the World Health Organization (WHO) to decide.

Is the title misleading or inaccurate? No, again, it’s a direct quote and represents the opinion of multiple health professionals.

Are these health professionals implying that COVID-19 is a fake virus? No, they are simply implying that it’s not as dangerous as it’s being made out to be., and I summarize some of that information below that has them coming to that conclusion.

These doctors and scientists are being heavily censored across all social media platforms, and those who write about them are experiencing the same.

Many of the claims these doctors make have been ‘debunked’ by mainstream media, federal health regulatory agencies and ‘fact-checkers’ that are patrolling the internet.

Any information that does not come from the (WHO) is not considered reliable, truthful or accurate, and that would include the information presented in this article and information shared by these experts in the field.

People are being encouraged to visit the WHO’s website for real and accurate information about COVID-19 instead of listening to doctors and scientists who oppose the narrative of these health authorities.

What Happened

More than 500 German doctors & scientists have signed on as representatives of an organization called “Außerparlamentarischer Corona Untersuchungsausschuss.”

Außerparlamentarischer Corona Untersuchungsausschuss stands for the “Corona Extra-Parliamentary Inquiry Committee and was established to investigate all things that pertain to the new coronavirus such as the severity of the virus, and whether or not the actions taken by governments around the world, and in this case the German government, are justified and not causing more harm than good.

As the Corona-Extra-Parliamentary Inquiry Committee, we will investigate why these restrictive measures were imposed upon us in our country as part of COVID-19, why people are suffering now and whether there is proportionality of the measures to this disease caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus.

We have serious doubts that these measures are proportionate. This needs to be examined, and since the parliaments – neither the opposition parties nor the ruling parties – have not convened a committee and it is not even planned, it is high time that we took this into our own hands.

We will invite and hear experts here in the Corona speaker group. These are experts from all areas of life: Medicine, social affairs, law, economics and many more. (source)

You can access the full english transcripts on the organizations website if interested.

This group has been giving multiple conferences in Germany, in one of the most recent, Dr. Heiko Schöning, one of the organizations leaders, stated that “We have a lot of evidence that it (the new coronavirus) is a fake story all over the world.”

To put it in context, he wasn’t referring to the virus being fake, but simply that it’s no more dangerous than the seasonal flu (or just as dangerous) and that there is no justification for the measures being taken to combat it.

I also think it’s important to mention that a report published in the British Medical Journal has suggested that quarantine measures in the United Kingdom as a result of the new coronavirus may have already killed more UK seniors than the coronavirus has during the peak of the virus.

Below is a press conference held by representatives of the group that took place last month, you can find more important information below that.

Why This Is Important

It can be confusing for many people to see so many doctors and many of the world’s most renowned scientists and infectious disease experts oppose so much information that is coming from the WHO and global governments.

Many scientists and doctors in North America are also expressing the same sentiments.

For example, The Physicians For Informed Consent (PIC) recently published a report titled “Physicians for Informed Consent (PIC) Compares COVID-19 to Previous Seasonal and Pandemic Flu Periods.”

According to them, the infection/fatality rate of COVID-19 is 0.26%. You can read more about that and access their resources and reasoning here.

John P. A. Ioannidis, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Stanford University has said that the infection fatality rate “is close to 0 percent” for people under the age of 45 years old.

You can read more about that here. He and several other academics from the Stanford School of Medicine suggest that COVID-19 has a similar infection fatality rate as seasonal influenza, and published their reasoning in a study last month.

You can find that study and read more about that story here.

Michael Levitt, a Biophysicist and a professor of structural biology at Stanford University criticized the WHO as well as Facebook for censoring different information and informed perspectives regarding the Coronavirus and has claimed that, with regards to lockdown measures, that “the level of stupidity going on here is amazing.”

You can read more about this here.

Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, a specialist in microbiology and one of the most cited research scientists in German history is also part of Corona Extra-Parliamentary Inquiry Committee mentioned above and has also expressed the same thing, multiple times early on in the pandemic all the way up to today.

Implementation of the current draconian measures that are so extremely restrict fundamental rights can only be justified if there is reason to fear that a truly, exceptionally dangerous virus is threatening us.

Do any scientifically sound data exist to support this contention for COVID-19? I assert that the answer is simply, no. – Bhakdi. You can read more about him here.

Below are some interesting statistics from Canada. (source)

The Takeaway

We have to ask ourselves, why are so many experts in the field being completely censored.

Why is there so much information being shared that completely contradicts the narrative of our federal health regulatory agencies and organizations like the WHO?

Why are these experts being heavily censored, and why are alternative media platforms being censored, punished and demonetized for sharing such information?

Is there a battle for our perception happening right now? Is our consciousness being manipulated? Why is there so much conflicting information if everything is crystal clear?

Why are alternative treatments that have shown tremendous amounts of success being completely ignored and ridiculed?

What’s going on here, and how much power do governments have when they are able to silence the voice of so many people? Should we not be examining information openly, transparently, and together?

Epidemiologist: COVID-19 Fatality Rate ‘Worst Miscalculation’ in Human History,"Ronald B. Brown, Ph.D., from the School of Public health and Health Systems at the University of Waterloo, Canada, recently stated that the COVID-19 fatality rate is the “worst miscalculation in the history of humanity.”

Brown is currently completing his second doctorate degree this time in epidemiology at the University of Waterloo.

Not long ago, Brown published a paper in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, titled “Public health lessons learned from biases in coronavirus mortality overestimation.”

In the paper he provides data and information he collected from his research, he compared informational texts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to data from independent scientists and Congressional testimony.

He states that “Results of this critical appraisal reveal information bias and selection bias in coronavirus mortality overestimation, most likely caused by misclassifying an influenza infection fatality rate as a case fatality rate.”

Below is a statement Brown recently gave to John C. A. Manley, a journalist who was the first to cover the story:

The subject of this article is disruptive, to say the least, although it is not as obvious from the title.

The manuscript cites the smoking-gun, documented evidence showing that the public’s overreaction to the coronavirus pandemic was based on the worst miscalculation in the history of humanity, in my opinion.

My manuscript underwent an intensive peer-review process. You are the first media guy who has responded to my invitation.

Dr. Brown added that CDC and WHO documents show that the case fatality rate for influenza was similar to the coronavirus, implying that the lockdowns were pointless.

His paper questions why the 2017-2018 influenza season in the United States did not “receive the same intensive media coverage as COVID-19.”

He points out that “the accuracy of coronavirus tests rushed into production during the pandemic were unknown.” And he explores how the media began focusing on an increase in coronavirus cases while ignoring the decrease in death rates.

The Bulgarian Pathology Association has taken the stance that the testing used to identify the new coronavirus in patients is “scientifically meaningless.” They cite an article explaining the science. You can read more about that here.

Why This Is Important

Dr. Brown is not the only one raising these points, yet it seems nobody really knows these facts because they are constantly ignored by mainstream media, who is simply presenting us with one perspective that doesn’t seemed to be based on science and data at all in my opinion.

It makes one wonder, what’s really going on here?

Why are deaths not a result of the coronavirus being marked as coronavirus deaths, even when it’s clear that that the coronavirus was not the cause? This has been observed across the globe.

A number of the world’s doctors and top experts in the field have been raising their concern with regards to the measures taken to combat the novel coronavirus.

For example, Michael Levitt, a Biophysicist and a professor of structural biology at Stanford University recently criticized the WHO as well as Facebook for censoring different information and informed perspectives regarding the pandemic. You can read more about that here.

More than 500 German doctors & scientists have signed on as representatives of an organization called the “Corona Extra-Parliamentary Inquiry Committee” to investigate what’s happening on our planet with regards to COVID-19, expressing the same sentiment.

They came together to investigate the severity of the virus, and whether or not the actions taken by governments around the world, and in this case the German government, are justified and not causing more harm than good.

You can access the full english transcripts on the organizations website if interested.

Another example would be a recent report published in the British Medical Journal has suggested that quarantine measures in the United Kingdom as a result of the new coronavirus may have already killed more UK seniors than the coronavirus has during the peak of the virus.

Reported case fatality rates, like the original official 3.4% rate from the World Health Organization, caused horror, panic and hysteria and were also meaningless.

Many scientists and doctors in North America are also expressing the same sentiments.

For example, The Physicians For Informed Consent (PIC) recently published a report titled “Physicians for Informed Consent (PIC) Compares COVID-19 to Previous Seasonal and Pandemic Flu Periods.”

According to them, the infection/fatality rate of COVID-19 is 0.26%. You can read more about that and access their resources and reasoning here.

You can find that study and read more about that story here.

This list goes on, and on, and on, and on..So why don’t we hear anything about it? Why are scientists, doctors and experts being heavily censored for sharing this information?

Why are media outlets like us being punished and demonetized for writing about it? What’s going on here? Is there another agenda at play?

Is NSA Whistleblower Edward Snowden right about the fact that governments are using this pandemic to place more measures upon the population that take away our rights, all under the guise of good will?

Why haven’t these measures been taken for other respiratory viruses that infect just as many, and kill just as many people and more than Covid-19 every single year?

These are important questions to ask and have a discussion around, especially when our right to even speak is slowly being taken away.

Facebook fact-checkers have made it quite clear that any information that does not come from the WHO or federal health regulatory agencies should not be considered as reliable.

The Takeaway

Why is there so much information being shared that completely contradicts the narrative of our federal health regulatory agencies and organizations like the WHO?

Is there a battle for our perception happening right now? Is our consciousness being manipulated? Why is there so much conflicting information if everything is crystal clear? Why are alternative treatments that have shown tremendous amounts of success being completely ignored and ridiculed?

What’s going on here, and how much power do governments have when they are able to silence the voice of so many people? Should we not be examining information openly, transparently, and together?

Is the new coronavirus, like 9/11, a catalyst for a shift in human consciousness. Are people ‘waking up’ as a result of what has, is and will transpire?

Toronto Public Health Also Admits: People Who Don’t Die From COVID-19 Are Still Added To The Death Count,"A common theme during this pandemic is the fact that public, provincial, state and federal health regulatory agencies have been, since the beginning of this pandemic, adding to the death count people who actually didn’t die as a result of Covid-19.

Toronto Public Health recently did the same, last month tweeting that “Individuals who have died with Covid-19, but not as a result of COVID-19 are included in the case counts for COVID-19 deaths in Toronto.” (source)

This means that people are being added to the COVID death count who really didn’t die of COVID. This would logically inflate the number of deaths from what they actually are, thus driving the true infection mortality rate even lower than what it’s already at.

That being said, multiple mainstream media articles have suggested that there are also concerns that some deaths that have been a result of Covid-19 have been missed during this pandemic.

According to Factcheck.org, “One Facebook user has claimed the opposite, erroneously suggesting the count is being inflated by unrelated deaths, and copies of that claim have gone viral on the social media platform” and the idea that deaths are being miscalculated and in the opposite direction of what mainstream media is claiming, is false.

But these fact-checking organizations are quickly gaining a bad reputation. There are multiple instances where organizations like this will simply label something as false without actually conducting an appropriate investigation.

For example, they didn’t acknowledge that experts and public health authorities are actually admitting to the possibility that the death count is inflated.

There are a number of examples beyond the one that came from Toronto late last month.

Dr. Ngozi Ezike, Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, pointed out that all people who pass away and test positive for COVID-19, regardless of the cause of death, means that the death will be marked as a COVID-19 death.

She stated that,

If you were in hospice and had already been given a few weeks to live and then you were also found to have COVID, that would be counted as COVID death, despite if you died of a clear alternative cause it’s still listed as a COVID death. So, everyone who is listed as a COVID death that doesn’t mean that was the cause of the death, but they had COVID at the time of death. (source)

Colorado health authorities recently admitted to doing the same thing, you can read more about that here.

Vittorio Sgarbi, Italian politician Mayor of Sutri, gave an emotional speech at a hearing on the 24th of April where he emphasized that the number of deaths in Italy due to COVID-19 are completely false and that the people are being lied to. You can watch that and read more about it here.

The point is, this has been a common theme throughout the pandemic.

Another strange finding is that The Bulgarian Pathology Association has taken the stance that the testing used to identify the new coronavirus in patients is “scientifically meaningless.” They cite an article explaining the science. You can read more about that here.

It’s also reasonable to consider that in some cases, Covid may have contributed to a death but may not have been the cause, as some underlying conditions might have also played a role. This has been a common theme as well.

Jon Rappoport’s Investigation of the So-Called COVID Deaths,"by Jon Rappoport

At this point, I’ve written and published over 150 articles on the COVID fraud. For every major assertion I make in the following overview, I’ve written at least one article.

To sum it up: deaths labeled “COVID” have nothing to do with the purported virus.

The purported virus has never been discovered. A claim of discovery was made, but proper scientific procedures were never carried out.

Which leaves the question: why are all these people dying?

Are the deaths all stemming from the same cause? No. They aren’t.

Overview: A huge percentage of people dying have traditional diseases: flu-like illness, pneumonia, other lung infections. Many of these deaths have been re-labeled as COVID deaths.

For example, about 300,000 people a year in China die from pneumonia. It’s quite easy to call some of these deaths “COVID.”

A large number of people in Italy die every year from flu-like illness. The same re-labeling occurs there.

In Chinese cities, in the north of Italy, in Spain, there is very heavy air pollution. This pollution causes severe lung conditions and exacerbates already-existing lung problems. Some of the consequent deaths are called “COVID.”

As I’ve stated in previous articles, COVID is old people. In New York, for example, those 65 and older account for 73.6 percent of all so-called COVID deaths in the city.

These people are actually dying, prematurely, of previous serious health conditions, plus long-term treatment with toxic drugs, plus the terror of a COVID diagnosis, plus isolation from family and friends. Many of these people are dying in nursing homes.

No new virus required.

Take that picture and it will generally describe what is happening all over the world. COVID is old people. In Canada, for example, 81 percent of all so-called COVID deaths occur in nursing homes.

One other factor in New York. The current hospital treatment—breathing ventilators and sedation—kills 97.2 percent of those patients over the age of 66 who are subjected to it.

What about this re-labeling I mentioned? How is it done? Several ways. In hospitals, doctors simply write “COVID-19” on patient files. After patients die, their charts can be tagged “COVID.”

In general, there are three types of diagnosis. No test at all—just the observation of general flu-like symptoms. Or a PCR test, or an antibody test.

Both tests spit out “COVID” results in a significant percentage of cases. The result has nothing to do with the detection of a unique “COVID virus.” The result is a function of the tests.

What about new conditions? Are any people dying as a result of non-traditional factors? In any so-called pandemic, this is possible.

In the north of Italy, there were several vaccination campaigns, just prior to the announcement of “COVID.”

In New York, as I pointed out, the ventilator treatment is killing patients. Then there is the whole issue of 5G technology rollouts.

To delve into that subject, I suggest exploring the work of Arthur Firstenberg, author of The Invisible Rainbow.

Do not assume that ONE CAUSE is the explanation for all so-called COVID deaths. This is a common deep error.

“Well, if it isn’t the virus, then what is it?” There is no “it.”

There is only a psychological disposition to search for an “it.” Look for MULTIPLE CAUSES.

There are always outlier cases. Unexplained deaths. Some people are quick to jump on these cases and claim they prove the virus is real and is a killer on the loose. Nothing could be further from the truth.

“Young and healthy, suddenly dropped dead. See, it must be the virus.”

No, it doesn’t have to be the virus. Unexplained cases — especially when a viral cause is arbitrarily brought on board—need to be examined very closely. They rarely are.

When I was writing my first book, AIDS INC., in 1988, I looked into a very early set of AIDS cases in Los Angeles.

They were all described as young, “previously healthy,” and then “suddenly struck down by a new virus.”

The CDC published parts of their medical records. From the records, it was clear “previously healthy” was a gross lie. These young men had prior medical conditions, for which they were undoubtedly treated with toxic medicines.

There was an indication of toxic street drug use. After an hour of reading their partial records, the diagnosis of “suddenly struck down by a new virus” was quickly dissolving.

I’ve been investigating so-called epidemics for 30 years. I’ve developed the strategy of looking for multiple causes of death that have nothing to do with the announced virus of the moment. I’ve always found those causes.

COVID Increasingly Being Used to Medically Kidnap and Traffick Children,"by Brian Shilhavy

This past Friday (June 26, 2020) US District Judge Dolly Gee ordered the release of migrant children who are currently being held in ICE family residential centers, due to fears of COVID-19 spreading.

While this may sound like a good thing on the surface, it is not. Judge Gee only ordered that the children be released, but not their parents or adult family members. She left the decision to release adult family members of the children up to ICE.

This is a peculiar ruling, given that children have almost a ZERO chance of dying from COVID, while older adults with pre-existing conditions are most at risk.

So if the children’s parents or other adult family members are not released, where will the children go?

They are to go to “non-congregate settings” that include “suitable sponsors.” This is basically the foster care system, which we know is the main pipeline for supplying child sex slaves in child trafficking.

Children coming across the border with no birth certificates and other documentation are ripe for child trafficking, and this was highlighted in a 2016 report by U.S. Senator Rob Portman which showed just how widespread this is.

His Senate report noted several “Systemic Deficiencies” in the government’s failure to protect these vulnerable children from organized criminal trafficking:

HHS’s Process for Verifying a Category 3 Sponsor’s Identity and Relationship with a UAC Is Unreliable and Subject to Abuse

HHS Is Unable to Safeguard Children from Sponsors Attempting to Accumulate Multiple Children

HHS Failed to Require Background Checks on Non-Sponsor Adult Household Members or on Backup Sponsors

HHS Policy Allowed Non-Relatives with Criminal Histories to Sponsor Children

HHS Does Not Ensure a Sponsor Has Adequate Income to Support a UAC

HHS Approves Placements with Sponsors Who May Not Remain in the Country

Sponsors Often Inflict Legal Harm on UACs by Not Ensuring Their Appearance At Immigration Proceedings

So these migrant children in ICE family residential centers were already in the safest place they could possibly be, but now due to a federal district judge they could potentially be released and enter the lucrative child trafficking network, all under the excuse of “protecting them” from COVID-19.

We have also previously reported how COVID is being used as an excuse to take American children away from their parents.

In another bad news report for child sex trafficking, it was reported that the top attorney representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking crimes was fired last week. Matt Agorist reports:

Geoffrey Berman, the powerful US attorney for the Southern District of New York has been the lead investigator into the Jeffrey Epstein child sex trafficking case since before the billionaire’s suspicious suicide.

However, this friend of President Donald Trump who contributed to his campaign, was surreptitiously removed from his post by Attorney General William Barr — who falsely claimed Berman “resigned.”

Now, the lawyer for several of Epstein’s victims, Spencer Kuvin, is speaking out about the “highly suspect” removal of the top attorney.

He is speculating that Trump or one of his staff may have asked Berman to stop investigating Prince Andrew over his ties to the billionaire pedophile and then fired him when he refused.

As the Guardian points out, Berman and the Duke of York have become embroiled in a series of public rows over what the US prosecutor alleges is his refusal to answer questions in their investigation into allegations of sex trafficking and other crimes against Epstein.

This has put a target on Berman’s back by the ones who continue to protect those involved in the elite child trafficking scandal.

In a scathing interview, Kuvin told The Sun Berman’s firing was a massive step backward in the progress they’ve made for obtaining justice for the victims.

“The timing of this is highly suspect for an internal favor having been requested by the President,” Kuvin told The Sun.

“Because we know that the investigation and requests for repeated interviews with Prince Andrew ramped up in just the past month. And now all of a sudden the one man that’s been pushing for those requests has been fired for no reason.” (Source)

Do You Want to Protect Your Children from Medical Kidnapping? Do NOT Get Tested for COVID and AVOID the Medical System!

We have been warning America for over 5 years now that Medical Kidnapping is REAL, and threatens every family in the United States.

Well the Satanic Pedophile system behind this is kicking things up a notch with COVID, and the situation is about to get much, much worse!

As efforts go full speed ahead to implement contact tracing, the Government is getting ready to take many more children away from their parents using the excuse of “protecting” them from COVID, even though all medical statistics show that COVID is not a risk to children.

They take on a far greater risk of dying by simply riding in an automobile.

See our previous articles for evidence that a plan is currently in place to medically kidnap thousands, if not tens of thousands or more of children across this country using COVID as the excuse.

The best way to try and avoid this is to abstain from using the medical system completely. Do not get tested for COVID!

If they take a cotton swab sample from your mouth, or a blood test, they now have your DNA that can be recorded in a database, and you can be subject to contact tracing.

Most all cell phones now have contact tracing apps that have been installed without your knowledge. Try to locate it and disable it.

But the best policy is that if you leave your home, turn your cell phone OFF!

Or at least put it on Airplane mode, because you never know when you might encounter someone who has been or will be identified as COVID positive, and if there is a record of you interacting with this person, you could be quarantined and they could take your children away from you.

I am old enough to remember life without cell phones, and I can assure you the world will not come to an end if you do not carry your cell phone around with you everywhere you go!

If you want to carry it to use in an emergency, just turn it off or put it on Airplane Mode, and then only turn it back on if you need to use it in an emergency.

Children should NOT carry a cell phone around in any circumstances. When they leave your home, make sure they are accompanied with a parent or trusted adult within your household who understands just how serious the stakes are today in this current Plandemic operation.

Make sure you keep a well-stocked first aid kit in your home and in your car, and avoid the medical system as much as possible.

We have been educating the public for years on just how dangerous doctors and hospitals are when it comes to medical kidnapping, and now the stakes are ten times higher in the new COVID world we live in!

Sadly, the world is run by pedophiles, and you will find them in highest sectors of our society, especially in institutions that are supposedly “protecting” children.

In any government institution or private business that works with children, just assume there are pedophiles present somewhere waiting for the opportunity to kidnap your children, especially through the medical system.

If you think I am exaggerating to make a point, I encourage you to research this topic more fully, because if anything, I am not even coming close to reporting just how bad and widespread this is.

As Businesses Close Due to Coronavirus, the Business of Child Sex Trafficking in Foster Care Flourishes

And unfortunately statistics show that poor people of color face a far higher risk of having their children taken away from them, as they have very little means to fight back.

A man in Tampa, Florida filmed this encounter on the streets today and published it to his Twitter account.

Someone has also posted it on YouTube.

The official report from the police is that the mother was endangering herself and her children because she was walking out into the street and her children were barefoot, but watch the encounter for yourself and determine if these children were at risk and wanted help to get away from their supposedly psychotic mother (she was allegedly confined in a pysch ward after this):

It seems very clear from the video that neither the children nor the mother were requesting any “help” from the police.

Can President Trump Fix the Foster Care System with an Executive Order?

The other news that happened this week regarding the foster care system is that President Trump signed an Executive Order that many applauded as a way to help fix the Foster Care system.

The Hill reports:

President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order intended to improve the child welfare system, seeking to strengthen foster care and adoption programs amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The order, which Trump signed in the Oval Office without media present, aims to improve transparency and oversight and increase collaboration between public, private and faith-based groups that focus on child welfare.

“Among other changes, the Order seeks to increase partnerships between public, private, faith-based, and community organizations to help keep families together and, when that is not possible, to find children forever families,” the White House said in a news release announcing the order.

The measure directs Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar to assist care-givers by increasing the availability of trauma-informed training, expanding educational options and addressing barriers to accessing federal funding.

The order also attempts to improve federal oversight of child welfare requirements by putting HHS in charge of advising states on the use of federal funds to support legal representation for parents and kids.

First lady Melania Trump praised the order in a tweet, noting that the child welfare system “is responsible for creating safe & stable homes for more than 400,000 children.”

It comes as foster care and adoption agencies across the U.S. struggle with effects related to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Associated Press reported that family court proceedings have been interrupted by the outbreak, routine visits for biological parents have been disrupted, and some agencies have reported having difficulty recruiting potential foster parents.

Sadly, the First Lady has it completely wrong. The current foster care system is anything but a place “creating safe & stable homes for more than 400,000 children.”

Study after study proves that children in foster care have worse outcomes in life than if they had been left in their own homes, even if those homes were “troubled” such as when parents have a drug addiction problem.

And allocating even more money to the system to supposedly improve it is not a solution, but continuing the problem.

The real solution is to defund it completely and stop trafficking children, leaving them in their own communities and letting the communities deal with troubled homes without massive profits from government funding.

"The ‘Great Reset’ Decoded: A Radical Attack on Freedom and Traditional Values, to Impose a NWO","(LifeSiteNews) – One of the greatest threats to freedom and the Christian faith to emerge from the coronavirus crisis is the “Great Reset,” a far-left initiative to “to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies.”

Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò notably warned about the Great Reset in his latest letter to President Donald Trump, calling it “a global conspiracy against God and humanity.”

The Great Reset is spearheaded by the World Economic Forum, or WEF, which is known for hosting annual summits in Davos, Switzerland, convening thousands of global elites.

It is largely a creation of WEF founder Prof. Klaus Schwab and was announced this past June in a virtual meeting co-hosted by him and the UK’s Prince Charles.

The event featured high-profile supporters, such as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, and CEOs of Mastercard and BP.

In June, Schwab laid out, in no uncertain terms, the mission of the Great Reset to revolutionize the global economy and permanently curtail freedoms of the pre-coronavirus era.

Since COVID-19 represents “a crisis unlike any other,” he said, “it also requires a response like no other.”

“The Great Reset will require us to integrate all stakeholders of global society into a community of common interest, purpose, and action.”

“Every country, from the United States to China, must participate, and every industry, from oil and gas to tech, must be transformed,” Schwab demanded. The alleged “unsustainability of our old system” must be totally thrown off.

National governments will need to “steer the market toward fairer outcomes,” for the Great Reset, overhauling domestic tax policy and trade agreements, Schwab explained.

Companies must have “clearer guidelines,” namely, those already produced through the WEF, which gauge corporations based on metrics like ethnic diversity and climate impact.

The energy industry, in particular, requires near-total metamorphosis. According to Schwab, “climate change could be the next global disaster with even more dramatic consequences for humankind. We have to decarbonize the economy in the short window we have left.”

The banking and finance industries are other top targets, as with IMF Director Georgieva’s proposal for states forcibly to halt payments by banks to their shareholders.

In short, the Great Reset entails nothing less than global conversion to “stakeholder capitalism,” an economic framework closely resembling plans by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

Not surprisingly, the Chinese government has a hand in this initiative. China was represented at the initial meeting by Ma Jun, chairman of China’s Green Finance Committee and member of the National People’s Congress. Ma pushed for “strict environmental regulations” and a higher proportion of state-run “green projects” “than at any time in history.”

Along with Ma, representatives from more than a dozen countries have joined events supporting the Great Reset. The World Economic Forum even claims Pope Francis’s “stamp” on the Reset, citing Fratelli Tutti and the pontiff’s condemnation of “the dogma of neoliberal faith.”

Francis has sent an address to the Forum four times in his eight-year pontificate and allows an annual Vatican roundtable at Davos.

While Schwab and his associates cite the COVID-19 crisis as the main justification for the radical shifts they want, they’re also weaponizing the virus to compel submission.

“We have a golden opportunity to seize something good from this crisis — its unprecedented shockwaves may well make people more receptive to big visions of change,” in the words of Prince Charles.

Besides “stakeholder capitalism,” the “big visions” of the Great Reset include direct assaults on the family. Along with things like “The Ocean” and “Batteries,” one of key themes of the Reset is “LGBTI Inclusion.” Since June, the World Economic Forum has run such articles as “Great Reset: Why LGBT+ inclusion is the secret to cities’ post-pandemic success” and “Why being an LGBT+ ally can transform lives – yours included.” With Microsoft and Pepsi, they rolled out a program over the summer called “Hour of Pride” to propagate “LGBTQI+ inclusion during the COVID-19 crisis.”

The Great Reset almost undoubtedly will attack the unborn and the sanctity of life as well. The World Economic Forum is no friend of life, having criticized the Trump administration’s decision to reinstate the Mexico City Policy (now called Protecting Life in Global Health Policy), which blocks most U.S. abortion spending overseas.

Moreover, the Forum pledged last September to advance the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and recently held a summit which focused on using the Great Reset to fulfill the SDGs. Included in the Goals is “universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services.” Multiple U.N. agencies, like the WEF-partnered World Health Organization, have made clear that abortion is to be understood as within those latter two categories.

Vaccines and ‘digital identity for every person on the planet’

Other intrusive features likely to be tied into the Great Reset include mass digital identification and COVID-19 vaccination. “Digital Identity” and “Vaccination” are both themes of the Great Reset, and the World Economic Forum has been advancing them through a number of programs.

Since July, the Forum has worked to develop digital health passes used to verify the coronavirus test status of travelers. This project, CommonPass, was launched in collaboration with representatives from 37 governments and ultimately seeks to provide “a standard global model” for COVID-19 passes.

CommonPass also plans to incorporate vaccination status in the future, which would help to effectively mandate COVID-19 vaccines by empowering airlines to demand immunization for travel. Trials began three weeks ago on United Airlines and Cathay Pacific flights, with the Centers for Disease Control and U.S. Customs and Border Protection observing.

The WEF leads another digital ID project, Platform for Good Digital Identity, which “advances global activities towards digital identities that are collaborative and put the user interest at the center.” Among the partners are the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Mastercard, and pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline.

One collaborator is ID2020, a nonprofit backed by the U.N. and multiple Great Reset partners. ID2020 promotes COVID-19 passes, like the WEF, and aspires “to enable access to digital identity for every person on the planet,” with vaccination as a potential “entry point.” The group was founded, in part, through the World Economic Forum and counts WEF as an early supporter.

On coronavirus vaccines, Schwab has speculated that “a full return to ‘normal’ cannot be envisaged before a vaccine is available” and that people might “have to be vaccinated every year” against the virus.

“The new hurdle,” he said, is a “vaccinating enough people… despite the rise of anti-vaxxers.” To that end, the World Economic Forum is rolling out a pro-immunization campaign called VIEW, targeting the “major threat” of “resistance to vaccination.”

The Forum also has served repeatedly as a venue to promote COVAX, the U.N.’s vaccine distribution program, run by the WHO, that aims to circulate two billion COVID-19 vaccine doses by 2021. COVAX is co-led by Gavi and CEPI, two other WEF partners, both of which were launched at Davos summits.

Whether in terms of economic self-determination, freedom from LGBT ideology, or basic personal liberties, the Great Reset poses an extreme danger to the free peoples of the world.

This wholly undemocratic, aggressively centralizing, and sin-peddling scheme “has Satan on its side,” in Archbishop Viganò’s words.

Nevertheless, as the archbishop reminded Christians, “The leveling inhumanity of the globalist project will shatter miserably in the face of the firm and courageous opposition of the children of Light.”

With God Almighty and “the Most Holy Virgin, who will crush the head of the ancient Serpent” for us, who can be against us?

Ultimate Proof: Covid-19 Was Planned To Usher In The New World Order",11/7/20 0:00,,0
"COVID-19 Lockdowns Are Neither Necessary, Nor Scientific, Nor Helpful","… A lockdown is one form of mandatory restriction of freedom of action.

Restrictions in the US have included bans on serving customers in restaurants and other places of business, bans of peaceful gatherings of too many people in one location (in violation of “social distancing” requirements), and bans on religious worship by groups deemed to have too many people in one place of worship.

The First Amendment to the US Constitution lists the right to peaceably assemble and the right to free exercise of religion. The First Amendment is part of what is called the Bill of Rights. Note that these amendments are not known as the Bill of Privileges or the Bill of Nice Things to be Purchased by Taxes.

The US Constitution could not have been ratified without the Bill of Rights, so these rights are fundamental to what it means to be an American.

There is no question that the COVID-19 lockdowns denied Americans these fundamental rights. The only question is whether the denial of these rights was necessary.

Some proponents of lockdown start and end their argument by stating the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19. The magnitude of the number is supposed to end any further discussion.

Anyone who questions whether the lockdowns have actually saved any lives are dismissed as having a callous disregard for human life. Back when the death toll from COVID-19 was around thirty thousand, I compared COVID-19 deaths to the annual deaths from influenza.

Some of my colleagues repeatedly notify me when the death toll from COVID-19 is updated. Their point is that if deaths from COVID-19 exceed some arbitrary number the lockdowns will have been vindicated.

It doesn’t seem to matter whether the deaths occurred during lockdowns or not; deaths from COVID-19 justify any action by government.

Comparisons with flu epidemics provide a frame of reference. The point is that in the past American civilization somehow survived comparable crises with similar death tolls without requiring lockdowns.

Freedom of worship and freedom of peaceable assembly are constitutionally protected rights.

The only plausible justification for suspending those rights would be an imminent and credible threat to the existence of America that required immediate and united effort to avoid.

A final death toll from COVID-19 of two hundred thousand or even 1 million would not change the argument despite being a substantially greater tragedy.

Some of my colleagues argue that life is priceless and is more important than any economic consideration. This is contrary to the foundation of America.

During the debate over secession from Britain at the Second Virginia Convention held in 1775, Patrick Henry asked the audience, which included Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, “Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?”

Patrick Henry concluded his address with a passionate answer: “but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!”

This quote is synonymous with a core American value: that the freedom to live one’s life as one chooses is even more important than life itself.

Individuals should choose whether the risks of socializing (including risks of contracting COVID-19) are worth the benefits of social exchange.

It is not a matter of putting a dollar value on life; it is a recognition that people regularly risk their lives voluntarily in pursuit of happiness.

We could completely eliminate deaths from motor vehicle accidents by banning motor vehicles. We continue to voluntarily use them, because the economic benefits of doing so are more valuable to us than the risks to our lives.

Another argument made by lockdown proponents is to “follow the science.” This is another phrase intended to end further discussion. Scientific hypotheses must be falsifiable by observation.

The scientific method is the process of testing falsifiable hypotheses by empiric observations that either support or reject them. The “science” is never settled and is never closed to challenge or discussion.

What proponents of lockdowns mean by “follow the science” is that statements made by scientists should be accepted as axioms and that anyone who challenges these statements is an ignoramus or a conspiracy nut.

An obvious problem exists when different scientists make conflicting statements. This problem is worse when the same scientist makes conflicting statements at different times.

As the debates over continuation or resumption of lockdowns continue, what is the current state of knowledge?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released their best estimate of symptomatic case fatality rates based on records of symptomatic cases, records of deaths, and antibody tests of wider populations.

The symptomatic case fatality rate is the risk of death after developing symptomatic disease. This is different from the mortality rate, which is the number of deaths per hundred thousand.

The symptomatic case fatality rates are 0.5 deaths per thousand symptomatic cases for those under 50 years of age, 2 per thousand for those age 50–64, and 13 per thousand for those over 65.

As a frame of reference, the case fatality rate for the Spanish flu of 1918 was greater than 25 deaths per thousand cases. The existing scientific data for COVID-19 do not justify the suspension of civil liberties.

The debate will always return to the total deaths, which now exceed one hundred thousand for the United States. There is nothing extraordinary about the death toll from COVID-19.

Total deaths in the US from all causes were 2,839,205 in 2018. The current mortality rate from COVID-19 in the US is 31.7. The total mortality rate in the US from all causes was 723.6 in 2018.

The mortality rate in the US in 2018 was 163.6 for heart disease, 149.1 from cancer, 48.0 from unintentional injury (including motor vehicle accidents), 39.7 from chronic noninfectious lung disease (mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), 37.1 from stroke, and 30.5 from Alzheimer’s disease.

The mortality rate from suicide was 14.2 in 2018. These comparisons do not ignore the tragedy of deaths from COVID-19; the figures provide a frame of reference.

There is no evidence that lockdowns saved any lives. Different political entities have tried different severities of lockdown.

Sweden tried a very liberal approach; their mortality rate from COVID-19 was lower compared with some other countries with more severe lockdowns such as Britain, Spain, Italy, and France.

There is no clear relationship between severity of lockdown and mortality rates from COVID-19 for different states in the United States either.

New York had one of the strictest lockdowns and has the highest mortality rate from COVID-19 of all states at 152.9. My own state of Texas had a relatively liberal lockdown and has a mortality rate from COVID-19 of 5.7.

Texas had a mortality rate from motor vehicle accidents of 12.7 in 2018. More than twice as many people in Texas died from motor vehicle accidents in 2018 than have died from COVID-19. Each lockdown represents a different experiment in policy.

If we “follow the science,” we will conclude that lockdowns had little or no beneficial effect and that policy should be set at local levels rather than state, national, or global levels.

Mandatory lockdowns should be ended. We have enough data for individuals to make decisions about whether they should stay in the safety of their homes or risk their lives by socializing.

Young people are at the least risk from COVID-19 and have the most to lose by economic deprivation. The elderly are at the highest risk and have the least to lose by staying at home since many are retired or disabled.

People who live in New York may very well make different choices from people in Texas.

In my home community of Lubbock, Texas, people have changed their behavior voluntarily. Some people wear masks and others do not. If you are afraid of those who do not, it is easy enough to avoid them.

I take outdoor walks. During these walks, people wave to each other. We give each other space voluntarily, but nobody calls in a SWAT team if some child or pet breaches the capricious and arbitrary six-foot barrier.

Calls for resuming lockdowns out of fear of second waves should be ignored. The lockdowns have dug a very deep economic hole, and we need to stop digging it deeper.

‘Covid-19 Has Turned Public Health into a Patient-Killing Experiment’,"Potentially lethal doses of the therapeutic drug hydroxychloroquine are being administered in ‘clinical trials’, sometimes without patient consent. Nearly a quarter of those participating in one such trial subsequently died.

From the beginning of the SARS-COV-2 / COVID19 plandemic rollout there have been disturbing hints, rumours and even overt whistleblower claims of seemingly gross medical malpractice connected with the treatment and handling of allegedly infected people.

We have heard about mandatory Do Not Resuscitate orders issued for the elderly, cognitively challenged people, autistic people and even children with fairly minor congenital conditions.

We have heard of terrifyingly inappropriate usage of invasive ventilation that can only increase the numbers of covid19 deaths’, and of general levels of incompetence and poor practice that must have the same result.

And now we have evidence of three clinical trials which require patients to be given up to 4 times the normal dosage of hydroxychloroquine, with or without their consent. In one of these studies over 25% of patients died.

This has been unearthed by Dr. Meryl Nass MD, and is covered in detail over at her siteand at the Alliance for Human Research Protection, a site dedicated to exposing unethical practice in the medical community.

The three studies are:

Solidarity, conducted by the World Health Organization, on 3500 Covid-19 patients at 400 hospitals, across 35 countries. As well as Hydroxychloroqine the trial included Remdesivir, Lopinavir with Ritonavir, Lopinavir with Ritonavir plus Interferon beta-1a.

Recovery, conducted in the UK, sponsored by the Wellcome Trust (GlaxoSmithKline) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK government. 1,542 patients took part, of whom 396 (25.7%) died

Remap, an ongoing multi-national project that is now trialing hydroxychloroquine as a SARSCOV2 therapy.

Doses employed in all studies were way above normal therapeutic doses and could well have proved fatal, especially to the very frail and compromised people enrolled in the trial, many of whom were already on ventilators or other forms of assisted breathing.

In fact to even be considered for the Remap trial a patient had to be “close to death, either on a ventilator or in shock, on pressor medications.”

Neither was any allowance made in dosage for patients with poor kidney or liver function, who might have increased difficulty in processing the drug. Only actual liver failure was grounds for reducing the dose:

No dose adjustment is necessary for renal dysfunction or concomitant use of renal replacement therapy. Clinicians should consider a dose adjustment in the presence of liver failure, however no dose adjustment is necessary for abnormal liver function tests in the absence of liver failure.

Patient consent was not considered necessary:

For patients who are not competent to consent, either prospective agreement or entry via waiver of consent or some form of deferred consent can be applied, as required by an appropriate ethical review body.”

Ironically, the Solidarity hydroxychloroquine trial was suspended on May 25th following the Surgisphere report in The Lancet that claimed 35% higher death rates in patients receiving Hydroxychloroquine, but which later turned out to be fraudulent, and indeed Nass suggests these medical trials are cynically sacrificing human subjects as part of the ongoing war against hydroxychloroquine, in a bid to prove it does not work or is unsafe:

Why is public health being turned on its head? REMAP-Covid is the third major multicenter clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine to give toxic doses to Covid patients. Who or what is behind this concerted effort to maim or kill patients in order to kill any appearance of benefit from hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19?

This is more than possible of course, but I also think we need to set these frankly murderous “trials” within the wider context mentioned above – the distribution of DNRs to healthy or mildly compromised people, the brutal system of almost deliberately induced and needless deaths described by the whistleblower nurses in the US, the deaths by ‘accidental’ neglect in care homes.

These are all beginning to add up to something very dark and very strange going on in the shadows, just beyond public scrutiny.

Whether this is deliberate policy or some dreadful perfect storm of institutionalised fear and chronic under-funding is hard to say. But something truly grotesque and potentially evil is going on here, and we can’t afford to ignore it.",6/25/20 0:00,,0
The False-Positive is Fuelling the Panic Over COVID-19,"by Neil A. Kurtzman, MD

Imagine an articulate chief lemming bragging that not only had his followers jumped off a cliff, but that they had done so in far greater numbers than any other slice of the rodents.

This is the position occupied by the US regarding testing for COVID-19. We’ve done more testing than any other country and bragged a lot about doing so; but no one seems to have survived to give a proper interpretation of the results.

To begin with, the tests currently in use do not test for the entire virus, rather they just test for various fragments of it. Many of the results are thus false, sometimes false positives and sometimes false negatives.

This means one has to interpret their results with caution. Our medical authorities, to say nothing of our political ones, don’t seem to be able to do this.

All medical students are taught the basics of screening in their introductory statistics course. The problem is that most of them either didn’t go or slept through the course. The rest immediately forgot what they had learned.

When testing for anything, a medical professional needs to know the positive predicative value (PPV) of the test as well as the negative predictive value. I’ll focus on the former.

In order to know the PPV — i.e., the percent likelihood that a positive test is a true positive — the sensitivity of the test must be known as well as prevalence of the disease, at least to an approximate degree.

According to a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, the sensitivity of the tests for COVID-19 is about 70 percent.

The prevalence in any of the tested populations is not yet known, so we cannot calculate the PPV, although we can calculate what it would be at any prevalence level we want to assume. I’ll get back to this below.

A test for COVID-19 that is 70 percent sensitive will only catch 70 percent of the tested subjects with the disease. Therefore, 30 percent will falsely test negative.

Additionally, Bayes’s theorem, the mere mention of which defeats the numeracy of all but the most resolute of physicians, says that a 70 percent sensitive test will be positive in 30 percent of the tested population that doesn’t have the disease.

(I am assuming a specificity that is also 70 percent. The specificity of the various tests used has not been given.)

Consider testing for COVID-19 in 1 million subjects, none of whom harbors the virus. Three hundred thousand will test positive.

This is the reason I doubt this report from Asturias, Spain, which tells us the region has gone fourteen days without recording a single new case of COVID-19.

Either they have stopped testing — you can’t get zero positive tests on a sizable population with a 70 percent sensitive test — or they are not telling the truth.

The Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker that is widely used and quoted considers a confirmed test to be equal to a positive test. This is an error of epic dimensions for the reasons just stated.

The professional and college athletics departments are making the same error. They are testing their athletes daily or every other day using a test that is no better than 70 percent sensitive.

Eventually all the players will test positive. They will be isolated for fourteen days, after which they may again test positive, ad infinitum.

How does one estimate the PPV of a COVID-19 test? At 70 percent sensitive there’s no need to. Such a test is so contaminated with both false positives and negatives that its use is virtually without utility.

Suppose we had a test that was 95 percent sensitive and specific. The PPV is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true and false positives. To make this calculation we must assume a prevalence of the virus in the sampled group.

Let’s start with a prevalence of 1 percent.

If we test 10,000 subjects, 100 will carry the virus. Of these, 95 will test positive. Bayes’s theorem says 495 (5 percent of the 9,900 patients) without the virus will also have a positive result.

That’s 495 false positive tests. The PPV in this hypothetical sample is 95/95+495, or about 16 percent.

Now assume our population (again 10,000 subjects) has 50 percent true positives. Here our PPV is 95 percent (4700/ 4700+250). The relationship of PPV to prevalence is given in the figure below.

Note that even with a 95 percent sensitive test we’ll be overwhelmed with false positive results if our tested population has a low prevalence for the virus.

The more we test, the more false positives we’re likely to get if our testing is not focused.

It should be obvious from the data above that all the testing we have done and continue to do has likely confused more than enlightened.

The virus is real and in the wild. How should we effectively deal with it?

The best indicator of our status is how many people are in the hospital because of a clinical diagnosis of viral pneumonia. More specifically, how many are in the ICU.

Note that testing here is unnecessary, as the assumption today is that any case of viral pneumonia is caused by the coronavirus.

If our situation regarding the epidemic improves, widespread testing will have played no role in this improvement. Why any improvement?

We recognized who the at-risk population was and they took shelter and continue to do so. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventon (CDC) estimates that mortality from COVID-19 in patients younger than 50 is 0.05 percent.

Virtually all of this mortality in younger patients comes from those with comorbidity. We also have gotten better at treating patients with severe pneumonia caused by the coronavirus.

The virus is likely to be with us for some time. Epidemics end either when those most susceptible to the pathogen have been exposed to it or when an effective and safe vaccine is available. We don’t have such a vaccine. It’s hard to know when or if one will be available.

And the logistics of manufacturing and administering billions of doses are formidable. In the meanwhile, we have to coexist with it while not destroying society, socially and economically, in the process.

We will also have to admit that our current testing regime has alarmed the planet without contributing a health benefit.",7/17/20 0:00,,0
Covid ‘Cases’ Are Medically Meaningless (Yet They Are Used to Justify Lockdowns and Destroy the World),"Notice how the mainstream media has stopped talking about coronavirus “deaths” and shifted to coronavirus “cases?” That’s because the term “cases” is a misnomer.

Any person who tests positive for the coronavirus is now considered a “case.” So as more testing is being conducted, more “cases” are emerging. But I’ve got news for the corrupt medical establishment: Testing positive for a virus does not create a “case” of illness.

As every doctor and virologist knows, a “case” is only established when a person has:

1) A symptomatic expression of illness

2) The presence of an identified pathogen that is known to cause such symptoms

Merely carrying a virus is not a “case.” If that were true, then the vast majority of Americans would right now be diagnosed with “cases” of influenza, and we would be in a media-declared influenza pandemic panic.

Merely carrying a virus without showing symptoms of sickness doesn’t make a “case”

The viral strains that people carry without symptoms don’t matter much, it turns out. Most carriers aren’t contagious, and most pathogens are harmless or latent unless the carrier suddenly experiences immune suppression (from something like the extreme stress of losing their job, for example, or being locked in their own homes).

Running around the country with covid-19 tests and finding more and more people who carry the virus without symptoms is not legitimate medicine.

It’s a scam. Or a “scamdemic” to be more precise.

It does nothing for public health and is primarily used by the corrupt Big Pharma industrial complex to scam billions of dollars out of taxpayers by pretending everybody needs to be injected with high-profit vaccines.

There was a time, in mid-April, when the weaponized coronavirus was killing 1 in 10 people it infected, but as the virus lost many of its “gain of function” properties, it became far less lethal. This is called “host adaptation” and it’s a well-known phenomenon in virology.

Now, the coronavirus is probably at least two orders of magnitude less fatal, which means most people who carry it won’t be harmed by it.

The vast majority won’t even be symptomatic.

The coronavirus circulating in the wild is rapidly approaching flu-like levels of coexistence with human hosts. And that means testing asymptomatic people for the presence of the virus achieves nothing other than spreading irrational panic about a disease that’s no longer much of a threat to the masses.

(But don’t put it past evil globalists to release a whole new strain that’s weaponized in a whole new way, as that seems to be their model for global domination and anti-human genocide.)

There was a time, early in the pandemic, when testing everyone made sense. It was necessary to identify “asymptomatic carriers” who were able to pass the pathogen to others.

We saw so-called “super spreaders” in early 2020, including people in South Korea who infected hundreds of others without even knowing it.

But as the lethality of the virus has now plummeted, the justification for testing asymptomatic people for the mere presence of the virus has evaporated.

It’s no longer medically justifiable to conduct such tests unless a person is showing obvious symptoms of sickness.

The CDC always chooses whatever course of action makes the most money for vaccine companies

I find it interesting that when asymptomatic testing was necessary, the CDC opposed it, arguing that only symptomatic people should be tested. This led to an explosion in the number of people infected in February, March and April.

But now that asymptomatic testing is no longer necessary, the CDC wants everyone tested, in order to perpetuate the scamdemic “case” numbers and generate more demand for high-profit vaccines.

In other words, the CDC can always be counted on to take whatever action promotes the spread of the pandemic and therefore promotes the financial interests of vaccine makers.

The simple truth in all this is that the CDC and Big Pharma are criminal cartels that exploit this engineered “plandemic” to enslave humanity and extract insane profits from taxpayers.

That’s what this has always been about from the very start. That’s why you also need to see the bombshell new documentary film, “Plandemic II: inDOCTORnation.”

Consider this film to be a “must-see” documentary that will absolutely blow your mind and forever change your understanding of the total corruption of the “science” establishment and the for-profit medical system.

In essence, a group of evil people built this virus and released it onto the world so they could crush humanity and earn billions in profits. Even more shockingly, this isn’t the first time they’ve tried this.

Covid-19 and the New World Order: 13 Ways Our World Will Change,"by Andrew Korybko

COVID-19 has fundamentally changed life as we know it, and it’s more than likely that our future will be a dystopian one given how various governments have already responded to this viral outbreak.

The skeptics among us are fearful that this whole pandemic is overblown and being exploited as a smokescreen for stealing our freedoms, and while their attitude towards this disease is questionable (and quite possibly dangerous), their suspicion about a government takeover of society is warranted.

Never before have governments had so much power over the people.

The problem, however, is that these newly assumed powers probably won’t be voluntarily surrendered after this epidemic ends, which is why many people are so concerned. They’re convinced that we’ve suddenly entered a period of global dictatorship, and it’s difficult to argue with them.

So much else is also changing as well, and it’s hard to keep up with the “COVID World Order” [a.k.a. COVID-1984] that’s been thrust upon us, but what follows is an attempt to briefly describe everything that’s already taken place and predict what will probably follow:

1. De-Facto Martial Law…

There’s no other way to describe both the “recommended” and mandatory quarantines that many in the world are experiencing than to call them what they are, a state of de-facto martial law, which isn’t being formally declared in order to not provoke any more panic than there already is.

2. …Is The “New Normal”

Now that de-facto martial law of a seemingly indefinite period has been accepted by the people (whether willingly or begrudgingly), it’ll probably become the “new normal” and be implemented countless times in the future, be it as an “overabundance of caution” in the event of another outbreak or under any other pretext.

3. Social Media Censorship Will Intensify

“Big Brother” is already here, but he’s going to become a bigger bully than ever before by intensifying his censorship of people’s social media posts on the basis that they’re “socially irresponsible” (e.g. questioning the seriousness of this disease), after which the “politically incorrect” net will widen to encompass other topics too.

4. Travel Will Never Be The Same Again

Domestic and international travel will never be the same again, with internal restrictions on movement likely becoming commonplace and most foreign guests being required to self-quarantine for a period of time except in special circumstances, thus all but killing the global tourism industry.

5. Border Control Will Become More Robust

Gone are the days of so-called “open borders” where anyone can freely move between jurisdictions at will (whether legally or otherwise), with more stringent controls being put into place to [allegedly] protect the local population from outsiders (including their own compatriots from elsewhere in the country).

6. Mandatory Vaccines Are Coming

For whatever one thinks about vaccines, there’s probably no way to stop them from becoming mandatory after the COVID-19 pandemic, with it being predicted that people will have to prove that they’ve been vaccinated in order to do anything at all such as study, work, travel, and receive government benefits.

7. Remote Learning & Working Will Increase

With so many people stuck at home and unable to leave except to purchase essential goods in most cases, it’s predictable that remote learning and working (the latter which will of course be for those whose jobs allow them to do so) will pick up in the coming future as society gets used to this way of doing things.

8. 5G Is Inevitable

The massive surge of online traffic from folks who are learning, working, or simply entertaining themselves online will necessitate the rapid roll-out of 5G technology despite what some people suspect are its serious health concerns.

9. Society Depends On Just A Few Jobs To Function

The “new normal” of de-facto martial law has made many people realize that society really just depends on a few jobs in order to continue functioning at the bare minimum, with these being techies, grocery store and pharmacy employees, bank clerks, healthcare professionals, food service workers, farmers, and truckers.

10. Nationalization Might Be Imminent

For better or for worse, governments across the world might go on a nationalization spree in order to take control of what they regard as “essential industries” (though whether some of them truly are or not is another story), which could lead to the informal imposition of either socialist or fascist economic models.

11. “Universal Basic Income”

Given the scale and scope of the global economic collapse that was catalyzed by the response to COVID-19, it’s foreseeable that governments will unveil what’s been described as a “universal basic income” in order to ensure that their people can continue to at least purchase basic goods and services.

12. Mandatory Medical Training In Exchange For Government Benefits

Medical training is arguably more important than military service nowadays, so the state will probably make it mandatory in schools from here on out and for anyone who wants to receive government benefits, thereby enabling the government to draft them in the future whenever there’s a dearth of healthcare professionals.

13. Say Goodbye To Cash

The cashless society is coming, whether justified by the (real, false, or exaggerated) fear that lethal viruses can be spread by paper currency or as the government’s preferred method of dispersing its “universal basic income”, meaning that the authorities can cut folks off from their funds at any time that they want to.",4/3/20 0:00,,0
The CDC May Stop Calling COVID-19 An ‘Epidemic’ Due To A Remarkably Low Death Rate,"What Happened: The COVID-19 death rate across the US has now been confirmed to be so low that it’s on the edge of no longer being qualified as an epidemic, and therefore the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is poised to soon stop calling the virus an “epidemic” as it will no longer match the organizations definition.

by Joe Martino

The primary reason why confirmed death rates are so low is due to extreme amounts of testing in the United States.

Although most outside the box thinking people and health professionals knew a couple weeks in that the death rate was extremely low, it has taken up until now for the CDC to admit to this position.

“Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 9.0% during week 25 to 5.9% during week 26, representing the tenth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC,” the agency wrote on its website.

A spokesperson for the CDC stated “the percentage is currently at the epidemic threshold.”

One could assume that as more tests are completed, or even if common sense estimation was used, COVID-19 would not qualify as an epidemic according to the CDCs definition.

To the CDC, an “epidemic” is “an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.

We’ve only been seeing sharp declines, and in most cases, any increase in cases are non-symptomatic.

There have even been multiple scientists who clearly illustrated this months ago but were ridiculed for it.

Media and government continue to report on ‘new cases’ every single day as testing continues. The challenging part is, they are not sharing how many of these cases are symptomatic or result in any form of hospitalization.

Therefore, simply reporting on how many new confirmed cases there are is doing nothing but rile the public up into fear for no reason.

The vast majority of “confirmed cases” are people who have no symptoms and have no idea they even had antibodies for the virus. Not to mention the likely inaccuracy of COVID testing.

Why it matters:

As many outside mainstream consensus spoke about since late February, testing results show that more people have likely contracted COVID-19 than testing data reflects.

This means even way back then, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was lower than any of the extreme estimates that came out of government and health agencies. All of which have been proven wrong along the way.

Those who have questioned the narrative, like us here at CE, have had to deal with shadow banning on social media, fact checking fallacies, and demonetization as a result of reporting on the facts instead of the hysteria.

The sad part is, everything we have reported on and suggested would soon happen did and yet we have been constantly ‘punished’ for it.

Death rates were not as high as thought, testing is not accurate, and this virus is not near as serious as it’s being made out to be – point blank, there was no need for a lockdown.

But given there was a lockdown, we can look to either complete government incompetency or the fact that there is likely much more going on here behind the scenes than many people want to admit to.

Further to that, and going deeper, we can ask how this lockdown and entire virus situation was actually serving the collective to see what’s really going on in our world and why it might be time to bring about some BIG change.

Remember, it’s not the people vs. the deep state, they simply play a role in pushing the evolution of consciousness. I cover this in great detail here.

The Takeaway

More statistics and events are coming to the surface showing that we have been misled greatly about the recent ‘pandemic’, and even though many people in alternative media and alternative health said since day 1 that this was fishy and made no sense, mainstream media and government continued on.

How is it that people with so few resources and access knew the truth before massive and ‘trusted’ sources did? Was it another catalyst for humanity to begin questioning why they trust these sources?

Was it another catalyst for people to begin listening to well backed and grounded ‘alternative’ or ‘conspiracy’ ideas as they consistently turn out to be true?

Given the fact our infrastructures collapsed so quickly, is it an opportunity for us to re-imagine our world?

Re-imagine what’s possible and truly question the type of world we wish to live in?

Is it time for us to activate self responsibility and begin setting aside the parent-child relationship we have with government?

It’s all been a catalyst.",7/11/20 0:00,,0
We Don’t Need No Stinking Vaccine for Covid-19,"A Glaring Omission

With the 24/7 media circus coverage of Covid-19 I find it particularly interesting that there is an obvious glaring omission of some extremely important facts relative to dealing with a virus, especially one that is allegedly so virulent like this one.

Yes, I read all about the critical need to shelter in place, stay inside away from other people, wash your hands constantly, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, wear your face mask and by all means observe social distancing if you MUST venture outside for food!

Then it’s repeated ad infinitum that the ONLY hope we have of ever returning to a semblance of normalcy is to have a vaccine to protect us!

Then to add some drama to this narrative the media highlights their death-o-meter scoreboard with the implied threat that you’ll be next IF you don’t obey the rules as dictated by the “experts”.

But what is assiduously avoided at all cost is any reference to our most potent defense against any virus; our body’s natural immune system.

Try as I might I couldn’t find anything about this first line of defense on the World Health Organizations (WHO) website or Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website. It’s as if it doesn’t exist and is completely irrelevant.

If these organizations were genuinely concerned about the health of citizens they would obviously discuss the vital role a healthy immune system plays in protecting us from illnesses.

But since they don’t its obvious some other motive is at work, at least to me, and I strongly suspect to other critical thinkers as well.

We now know from the science and data that over 90% of the people exposed to Covid-19 have no symptoms at all or at worst a mild cold.

The flu vaccines we have are only effective 30% to 60% of the time and the bugs change regularly so a vaccine that worked OK last year may barely work at all this year. Let’s learn some more about our body’s immune system.

Virus protection without a vaccine

There is an enlightening article on Web MD titled: “How to use Your Immune System to Stay Healthy”. That’s a pretty straight forward title now isn’t it?

Early on Bruce Polsky, MD, interim chairman department of medicine and chief division of infectious disease at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City says:

“We are endowed with a great immune system that has been designed evolutionarily to keep us healthy.”

The article goes on…

“The immune system is your body’s natural defense system. It’s an intricate network of cells, tissues and organs that band together to defend your body against invaders.

“Those invaders can include bacteria, viruses, parasites, even fungus, all with the potential to make us sick. They are everywhere-in our homes, offices and backyards…“

The truth is no amount of social distancing, hand washing or face mask wearing is going to eliminate our exposure to these various bugs. That’s why we were created with this amazing first line of natural defense.

Here’s more from Web MD …

“The immune system can recognize millions of different antigens. And it can produce what it needs to eradicate nearly all of them. When it’s working properly, this elaborate defense system can keep health problems ranging from cancer to the common cold at bay… “

Wow! That’s pretty amazing stuff isn’t it! According to Web MD a properly functioning immune system can “keep health problems ranging from cancer to the common cold at bay.”

So why isn’t this “science” being included in all the other health recommendations we’re being bombarded with daily? It seems to me that any “expert” worth their salt would be talking about the importance of a healthy immune system to stay healthy.

But there’s more …

The Web MD article noted that failure to eat a healthy diet, sitting around not exercising, not getting enough sleep and chronic stress can all lead to a compromised immune system. To quote Dr. Polsky again:

“… Lifestyle aspects are very, very important.”

So if our lifestyle is very, very important to staying healthy as the good doctor says ask yourself this question? Based on the Web M.D. article virtually all the results of the lockdown serve to weaken our immune systems.

The stress of unemployment, constant harping about infections and rising death rates, lack of exercise and now a crack in our food distribution system all are known to weaken the human immune system.

I also find it quite interesting that large groups of people can shop at Walmart, Home Depot or other big box stores but they can’t attend their local church even if it’s a “drive through” service?

Web M.D. says:

“Research shows that people with close friendships and strong support systems tend to be healthier than those who lack such supports.”

During times of crisis people need encouragement and their faith built up more than ever before.

Mandating people huddle in fear in their homes with constant media reports of infections and death bombarding them continually is there any wonder peoples immune systems are under severe stress?

Boosting Your Immune System

If you would like to boost your immune system consider checking out Dr. Mercola’s website at www.mercola.com. He’s an osteopathic MD with a focus on natural health.

There are a variety of simple, low cost resources you can utilize to support good immune system health so you can hopefully fight off the bugs that are a part of everyday life.

And above all, avoid the main stream media like the plague! Their fear mongering is doing more to harm the nation’s health than any virus ever could!

Boost your immune system and laugh at Covid-19 and all the cowering sheeple you see furtively scurrying about with their masks on.

Humans were created with a natural immune system that has served them well for thousands of years to combat flu bugs.

By following some common sense steps you can ensure your immune system is functioning well and provides the first-line-of-defense that protects 90% of the population.

Lockdowns Were a Scam: Asymptomatic Carriers Don’t Spread COVID-19,"The whole purpose (supposedly) of the lockdowns was to keep those healthy people who had COVID-19 from spreading it when they didn’t have symptoms.

The entire planet was terrified of healthy human beings, so governments locked down entire swaths of the population without much evidence whatsoever.

Now, the WHO (World Health Organization) has said that those scary healthy people who are infected but have no symptoms are not likely to spread the virus.

Mad yet? If not, you should be. This was all done to usher in the New World Order and they aren’t done playing with us yet.

Some Americans, still haven’t had enough. There are people literally still wearing masks and gloves in the summer heat while others cry for martial law to stop George Soros’ band of looters and thugs.

And it’s all being done for the same reason: the New World Order must happen. If we expect to stop it, we need to realize first what’s been done to us.

The entire shutdown was proven to be a hoax, yet the mainstream media and government officials are not giving up on the official narrative that we should all “fear the second wave.”

Articles are all over the place parroting fearmongering comments from experts (the same experts that locked us in our homes and put us on house arrest over a virus that was less damaging than the flu if you’re a healthy person) that we should be prepared for yet another lockdown.

The powers-that-should-not-be are not done toying with us just yet and Americans are not done falling for the lies and propaganda just yet either.

Martial law is necessary to complete the global takeover and far too many Americans have fallen in line DEMANDING that come to fruition.

Since coming out and saying asymptomatic people rarely spread COVID-19, the WHO said there’s a “misunderstanding,” and intend to toe the line using fear to keep people in a panicked state of dependency on the state for a false sense of safety.

"Covid Hospitalizations Disappear, But Authoritarians Refuse To Give Up","As the “Sun Belt” wave of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations burns itself out – as is always the case with a virus – those authoritarian politicians still clinging to the ability to push their citizens around refuse to give up.

As in the Lord of the Rings, they cannot bear letting go of the ring of power.

But what will it take for them to finally relinquish their stranglehold on our lives?

Many hospitals are now suffering from a lack of patients and deaths among those under 50 years of age remain nearly non-existent. When is this over? What’s the end game?
