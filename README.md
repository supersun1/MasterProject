## About
This Master Project focused on utilizing Natural Language Processing models to determine the accuracy and truthfulness of Covid-19 related news, articles, or texts.

From our model, we were able to achieve **97%** accuracy on every prediction.

This project's backend process is created using Google's [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) and Facebook's [RoBERTa](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_fairseq_roberta/) to accomplish this feat.

This accomplishment is explained at a high level in the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdU5Zek-iJM)
